Applicants should submit the letter of authorization provided to the applicant by the DMF holder which gives authorization to rely on the information in the DMF.34\n\nFootnote 34: 21 CFR 314.420(d). More information on DMFs, as well as the list of DMFs that FDA has received, is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/DrugMasterFilesDMFs/default.htm.\n\n1.12.4: Contains a statement, if applicable, that a request for a proprietary name has been made. An ANDA applicant requesting a proprietary name should submit that request when the ANDA is submitted to help ensure that an acceptable name is available at the time of approval. When requesting a proprietary name, a separate electronic submission should be made and identified as a \"REQUEST FOR PROPRIETARY NAME REVIEW.\"35\n\nFootnote 35: See the guidance for industry Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names (Rev.1).\n\nFootnote 36: Section 314.94(a)(3). See also the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n1.12.11: Contains the basis for submission.37 The applicant should provide: (1) the name of the RLD, (2) the application number of the RLD, and (3) the holder of the application for the RLD.\n\nIf the generic drug differs from the RLD in strength, route of administration, dosage form, or in that one active ingredient is substituted for one of the active ingredients in a listed combination drug product, applicants must first submit a suitability petition to FDA's Division of Dockets Management to obtain permission to file their ANDA.38 FDA will review the suitability petition to determine whether the requested change from the listed drug will impact the safety and effectiveness of the generic product and if any applicable requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act may be waived. The suitability petition must be approved by FDA before the ANDA is submitted.39 For an ANDA based on an approved petition under 21 CFR 10.30 or 314.93, the name of the RLD in section 1.12.11 must be the same as the listed drug in the petition, and section 1.12.11 must contain the FDA docket number for the petition and a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.40 When an applicant submits a petitioned ANDA, the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain (1) the name of the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned document number, and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.41({}^{,})42 When an ANDA applicant seeks approval of a generic drug that is a duplicate of adrug product in an approved petitioned ANDA (and for which the same drug has not been approved under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act), the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain: (1) the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, and RLD application number; (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned docket number; and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition. The first petitioned ANDA approved should be used for and identified in the appropriate sections of a subsequent ANDA as the reference standard. However, the RLD for that subsequent ANDA remains the listed drug referenced in the approved suitability petition.43\n\nFootnote 43: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\n1.12.12 Contains information demonstrating that the generic product is the same as the RLD.44_Same as_ means that the generic product is identical to the RLD in \"active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, except that conditions of use for which approval cannot be granted because of exclusivity or an existing patent may be omitted.\"45 To demonstrate that the proposed generic drug product meets this standard, applicants should provide:\n\nFootnote 44: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and \u00a7 314.94.\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nA statement that the conditions of use for the generic product have been previously approved for the RLD46\n\nFootnote 47: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\nInformation to show that the active ingredient(s) in the generic drug product is/are the same as the active ingredient(s) in the RLD47\n\nFootnote 48: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and \u00a7 314.94.\n\nFootnote 49: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nInformation to show that the route of administration, dosage form, and strength of the generic drug product are the same as those of the RLD48\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nAs applicable, information to indicate the strength of the generic drug product used in the in vivo bioequivalence (BE) studies (fasting and fed) to demonstrate BE of the generic drug product to the RLD\n\nFDA recommends that applicants submit, within their original application, all strengths that they intend to market.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for holders of Type II active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) drug master files (DMFs) that are or will be referenced in an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to an ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS (generic drug submissions). The guidance explains that, as of October 1, 2012, under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, commonly referred to as GDUFA:2\n\nFootnote 2: Public Law 112-144, Title III.\n\nDMF holders are required to pay a DMF fee when first authorizing the reference of their DMF in a generic application3 Footnote 3: For these purposes, such authorization is deemed to have occurred when the DMF \u201cis referenced on or after October 1, 2012, in a generic drug submission by an initial letter of authorization,\u201d Section 744B(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)(A).\n\nType II API DMFs must undergo an FDA completeness assessment (CA)\n\nThe guidance makes recommendations about the information that should be included in the DMF to facilitate a GDUFA CA. The guidance does not apply to Type II API DMFs used to support new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs),4 other submissions that are not generic drug submissions, or any other types of DMFs.5\n\nFootnote 4: Type II API, API intermediate, and drug product DMFs are not used to support BLAs submitted pursuant to sections 351(a) and 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nFootnote 5: See section 744A(7) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-41(7)).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nUnder GDUFA, beginning October 1, 2012, the holder of a Type II API DMF must pay a one-time DMF fee when the DMF is first referenced in a generic drug submission submitted to FDA on the basis of a letter of authorization (LOA) from the DMF holder.6 Also under GDUFA, holders of Type II API DMFs that were evaluated before October 1, 2012, must pay a one-time fee for the DMF when their DMF is first referenced in a new ANDA, an ANDA or PAS amendment, or an ANDA PAS on or after October 1, 2012.7 Only Type II API DMFs for use in generic drug submissions incur this one-time fee.\n\nFootnote 6: Section 744B(a)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)). For discussion of LOAs, see 21 CFR 314.420(b) and 314.50(g)(1).\n\nFootnote 7: The fee amount will be announced in the Federal Register not later than 60 days before the start of the fiscal year (generally on or about August 1 of the previous fiscal year).\n\nUnder GDUFA, Type II API DMFs intended for reference in a generic drug submission for which the fee is paid will undergo a CA. Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to make publicly available on its Web site a list of DMF numbers that correspond to DMFs that, having successfully undergone a CA in accordance with criteria to be published by FDA, are available for reference.\n\nAlthough the requirement for a CA for Type II API DMFs is new, FDA has previously evaluated DMFs in accordance with the criteria set out in the GDUFA Completeness Assessment Checklist for Type II API DMFs (CA Checklist), attached to this guidance as Appendix 1. In order to ensure adequate time for the CA, FDA strongly encourages the DMF holder to submit a complete DMF and pay the DMF fee at least 6 months prior to the submission of an ANDA or PAS that will rely on the DMF. When submitting a DMF, the DMF holder should also submit Form FDA 3794, the Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet, which includes the minimum information necessary for FDA to determine whether a DMF holder has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.8\n\nFootnote 8: See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM322676.pdf.\n\nDMF holders are encouraged to submit their DMFs using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format.9 More information is available on the eCTD format on FDA's Web site.10\n\nFootnote 9: Note that 24 months after the guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2013 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specification is finalized (i.e., May 5, 2017), DMFs will be required to be submitted using the eCTD format pursuant to the implementation timeline identified in the final guidance.\n\nFootnote 10: See information about electronic submissions at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\nFDA will perform a CA once a DMF holder files a Type II API DMF11 with the Form FDA 3794 and there is an initial verification of the fee payment. The CA does not replace the full scientific review, which determines whether the information contained in the DMF is adequate to support an ANDA regulatory action.\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s Web site on Drug Master Files at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/DrugMasterFilesDMFs/default.htm.\n\nIn brief, FDA will undertake a CA to determine the following:\n\nIs the DMF active?\n\nHas the fee been paid?\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed?\n\nDoes the DMF pertain to a single API?\n\nDoes the DMF contain certain administrative information?\n\nDoes the DMF contain all the information necessary to enable a scientific review?12\n\nFootnote 12: Id.\n\nIs the DMF written in English?13\n\nFootnote 13: If any part of the application is in a foreign language, an accurate and complete English translation shall be appended to such part. See 21 CFR 314.101(d)(5).\n\nFDA will conduct the CA by determining the answers to a series of questions listed in the CA Checklist, which is included in Appendix 1. DMFs for which the fee has been paid and which have been found complete in accordance with the criteria for a CA set out in the CA Checklist will be identified on FDA's public Web site as available for reference in support of a generic drug submission.\n\nFor complex APIs, in addition to the recommendations in the CA Checklist, DMF holders should ensure the DMF provides the data necessary for the Agency to review the DMF with respect to active ingredient sameness. Information on active ingredient sameness is discussed in the product's specific bioequivalence (BE) guidance when it becomes available on FDA's Web site.14\n\nFootnote 14: For example, for enoxaparin sodium: listed sameness equivalence criteria in the draft guidance include mode of depolymerization, source material, physicochemical properties, disaccharide building blocks, fragment mapping, sequence of oligosaccharide species, and biological and biochemical assays. If the appropriate product-specific data is not in the DMF, the DMF will be deemed incomplete.\n\nIn accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: \u201cActive\u201d is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.561609983444214", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: If the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee.

FDA will not receive - within the meaning of section 505(j)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act70 - a new ANDA or supplement submitted by that person, or any affiliate of that person, until the outstanding fee is paid.71\n\nFootnote 70: This provision references the \u201creceipt\u201d of ANDAs by FDA. The Agency evaluates an ANDA after it is submitted to determine whether it may be received. Receipt of an ANDA means that FDA has made a threshold determination that the ANDA is substantially complete; 21 CFR 314.101(b)(1).\n\nFootnote 71: Section 744B(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\n1 DMF Fees\n\nA DMF will be deemed available for reference if both the DMF fee is paid in full and the DMF has not failed an initial completeness assessment. No generic drug submission referencing the DMF will be received unless the fee is paid and the DMF is deemed available for reference.\n\nANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due but has not been paid will be provided notification of the DMF holder's failure to satisfy the user fee obligation. If the DMFfee is not paid within 20 calendar days after notification, the generic drug submission referencing the DMF will not be received.72\n\nFootnote 72: Section 744B(g)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 73: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 74: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 75: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 76: Section 744B(g)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix C ANDA Filing Fees\n\nIf an applicant does not submit payment of the ANDA filing fee within 20 calendar days of the due date, its application will be deemed incomplete on the date of submission and will not be received.73 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 73: Id.\n\nAppendix D Fee for API Information Not Included by Reference to DMF - (a)(3)(F) Fee\n\nIf a generic drug applicant submission contains information concerning the manufacture of an API at a facility by means other than reference by a letter of authorization to a Type II API DMF, and a fee equal to the DMF fee has not been previously paid with respect to such submission, then the applicant shall pay a fee in the amount described in section VII.D, in addition to the applicable ANDA filing fee.74 If these fees are not submitted within 20 calendar days of the due date then the submission will not be received.75 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 75: Id.\n\nAppendix E Facility Fees\n\nFailure to pay the facility fee within 20 calendar days of the due date will result in the following penalties:76\n\nFootnote 76: Id.\n\nNo new ANDA or supplement submitted by the person responsible for paying the fee or that person's affiliates will be received.\n\nNo new generic drug submission referencing the facility will be received until the fee is paid.\n\nThe facility will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nFDA will notify the referencing ANDA applicant of the facility's failure to satisfy its user fee obligations.\n\nFurther, all FDFs or APIs manufactured in the non-paying facility and all FDFs containing APIs manufactured in such a facility will be deemed misbranded.77 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nGDUFA Program Fees\n\nFailure to pay the GDUFA program fee within 20 calendar days of the GDUFA program fee due date will result in the following penalties:78\n\nFootnote 78: Section 744B(g)(5) of the FD&C Act.\n\nApplicants will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nAny ANDAs submitted by the applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will not be received.\n\nFurther, all drugs marketed pursuant to ANDAs held by such applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will be deemed misbranded.79 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nFootnote 79: Id.\n\nHowever, if an application or supplement was already received by FDA prior to the applicant being placed in arrears, FDA will continue the review of and accept amendments to those applications.\n\nXII Payment Information and Procedures\n\nThe payment process for GDUFA III is similar to the previous iterations of the program and other FDA user fees. The FDA website80 contains instructions for paying the fees.\n\nFootnote 80: https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/generic-drug-user-fee-amendments.\n\nPayment Procedures for GDUFA Fees\n\nThose responsible for payment of fees enter required information on FDA's User Fee System to generate a GDUFA cover sheet.\n\nThe cover sheet is designed to provide the minimum necessary information to determine if a person has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.\n\nThe cover sheet is submitted to FDA electronically generating a user fee payment identification number (PIN) to assist in tracking payment.\n\nCover sheets for ANDA filing fees should be submitted with ANDA submissions. The Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet and additional payment information is available on the GDUFA website (www.fda.gov/GDUFA).\n\nAcceptable Forms of Payment\n\nPayment must be made in U.S. currency drawn on a U.S. bank.81 Fee payers may pay online by credit card or Automated Clearing House (ACH) electronic check or send payment by check, bank draft, U.S. postal money order, or wire transfer.\n\nFootnote 81: See 87 FR 61601 (October 12, 2022), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-10-12/pdf/2022-22099.pdf.\n\nTimely Payment of Fees\n\nFDA's expectation is for full and timely payment of all GDUFA fees. Penalties associated with non-payment, including, but not limited to, refusal to receive a generic drug submission, drug product deemed misbranded, and failure of a DMF to be placed on a publicly available reference list, will apply until such obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nOne entity may pay GDUFA fees on behalf of another entity. Those paying fees are responsible for determining all financial institution transaction fees that may be deducted from an entity's authorized amount for payment to FDA. These include wire transfer and foreign exchange fees.\n\nRefund and \"Transfer\" Requests\n\nOther than as described in section VII.A, FDA will only fully refund payments of fees made in error. If a fee was properly incurred, there will be no refund of the payment.\n\nTo qualify for the return of a fee claimed to have been paid in error, a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request justifying such return within 180 calendar days after such fee was paid.82 The format for submitting refund requests is Form FDA 3913, attached as Appendix 1 and available at\n\nFootnote 82: Section 744B(m) of the FD&C Act.\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492188.pdf.\n\nA Form FDA 3913 written refund request should be submitted to the Division of User Fee Management at CDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFDA no longer permits the administrative action of applying a previously paid GDUFA fee (also referred to as a \"transfer\") from a closed-out fiscal year cover sheet to a different fiscal year cover sheet.83 Instead, payments from closed-out fiscal year cover sheets will only be processed as refunds to the original payors, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from when the original payment was made.\n\nRequests for the \"transfer\" of payments within the same fiscal year or open fiscal year may be permitted for the same fee type and for a fee obligation of the same payor, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from the original payment date. For example, a request to \"transfer\" a fee payment from a FY 2023 cover sheet to another FY 2023 cover sheetwithin the same fee type (perhaps due to an incorrect FEI) by the same payor will be processed, provided the request is made within 180 calendar days of the original payment date.\n\nAs another example, during September 2023 (FY 2023), an applicant may request a \"transfer\" of a fee to a FY 2024 cover sheet of the same fee type because FY 2023 has not yet been closed-out. However, if an applicant requests a \"transfer\" of a fee from a FY 2023 cover sheet during FY 2024 (beginning October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024), this transaction will not be permitted as FY 2023 has already been closed-out.\n\nTo request a \"transfer,\" applicants should complete Form FDA 3914 and email the form to\n\nCDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov. Form FDA 3914 is attached as Appendix 2 and is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492195.pdf\n--------------------\nContext title: Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.222951650619507", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: \u201cActive\u201d is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF fee has been paid. If it has not, FDA will not assign the DMF for CA. ANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due will be notified that the DMF holder has not paid the fee. If the DMF fee is not paid within 20 days after notification, FDA will refuse to receive the ANDA referencing the DMF.\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed for chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) by FDA in the context of a review of a prior application?\n\nIf FDA has reviewed the DMF for CMC after November 30, 2007, the DMF will be considered to have passed the CA without further analysis. If the DMF was reviewed for CMC prior to November 30, 2007, a CA assessment will need to be performed. For all DMFs that have not previously received a full CMC review, a CA assessment will need to be performed. If the DMF has not previously received this full review, it will be assigned to a reviewer for a CA.\n\n3 Check of Completeness Assessment Elements\n\nFDA will complete the administrative part of the CA Checklist (i.e., \"General Information\") during the CA. If the DMF is incomplete, FDA will send the DMF holder a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter. With certain exceptions specified in this guidance document, this letter will provide comments about each element that resulted in an incomplete designation for the CA.\n\nIf an item is marked \"n/a\" and does not apply to the DMF, the element is treated the same as if it were marked \"yes.\"1. Is the subject of the DMF a single API produced by one manufacturing process?\n\nThe subject of a DMF should be limited to one API and one manufacturing process. If a DMF includes information on more than one API or more than one manufacturing process for an API, the DMF will be deemed incomplete. If the DMF describes multiple APIs, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each API. Similarly, if there are multiple manufacturing processes for an API, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each manufacturing process.\n\n2 Does the DMF holder need to submit a complete update?\n\nIf the DMF is in paper format and it has been five years or more since the DMF received a complete update,18 or if there have been more than five amendments to the DMF, the DMF holder should provide a complete and comprehensive update to it. If such a DMF has not received an update, FDA will consider the DMF incomplete. The DMF holder must submit a complete update for FDA to determine whether it passes the CA.19\n\nFDA believes that the remainder of the CA Checklist is self-explanatory.\n\nFootnote 18: All changes must be reported as amendments. Annual reports are NOT to be used to report changes in the DMF.\n\nFootnote 19: The requirement for a complete update does not apply to the DMF if the entire DMF is in eCTD format, which always presents the DMF in its current state. The Agency highly encourages DMF holders to convert the entire DMF into an eCTD submission, which does not require reference to any previous paper submission.\n\n4 Completeness Assessment Outcomes\n\nFollowing the CA, FDA will find the DMF either complete or incomplete.\n\nIf the DMF is found complete, FDA will post the DMF number on a publicly available list on FDA's Web site to indicate the DMF is available for reference by generic drug submission applicants.20 Footnote 20: For the public list of DMFs available for reference, see http://www.fda.gov/gdufa.\n\nIf the DMF is found incomplete, the CA findings and comments will be compiled in a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter to the DMF holder that explains why the DMF was deemed incomplete. Information about the CA status of a DMF, other than the lack of a public listing on the FDA's Web site, will not be provided to anyone except the DMF holder and, as necessary, any generic drug submission applicant that the DMF holder has authorized to rely on the DMF.\n\nTo remedy a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter and pass the CA, the DMF holder should submit an amendment to its DMF to correct the deficiencies identified in the Incomplete Letter, or, if FDA has determined that the DMF should undergo a complete update, the DMF holder should resubmit the DMF with that update. FDA will then assess the revised DMF's completeness. If there are no deficiencies at this time, FDA will declare the DMF to be complete and to have passed the CA.\n\nAlthough a DMF may be deemed incomplete upon its first CA, FDA will work with DMF holders to provide guidance on how to revise the DMF so it may be found complete after resubmission. Once the DMF passes the CA, FDA will make the DMF number publicly available on its Web site.21 Footnote 21: Under GDUFA, a condition for a Type II API DMF to be considered available for reference is that it \u201chas not failed an initial completeness assessment\u201d (Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act). FDA does not interpret that provision as disqualifying a DMF if it has ever failed a CA. Instead, FDA considers this condition to be satisfied when, after submission of an amendment or resubmission of the DMF to address deficiencies identified by FDA, FDA finds that the DMF has passed the CA.\n\nV API information included in a generic drug submission\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not rely on information contained in a DMF, no CA will be performed. Instead, this information will be evaluated during the ANDA filing review.22 However, because GDUFA requires collection of a one-time fee for API information included in a generic drug submission (i.e., an (a)(3)(F) fee),23 the applicant submitting the generic drug submission containing the API information must pay this fee.\n\nFootnote 22: See guidance for industry ANDA Submissions \u2013 Refuse-to-Receive Standards.\n\nFootnote 23: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nVI Summary\n\nOnce the DMF fee is received, FDA will evaluate the DMF to make sure it meets the CA criteria.\n\nIf the DMF passes the CA, it will be found complete and the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's Web site.\n\nIf the DMF fails the CA, FDA will send a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter describing to the DMF holder the missing elements in its DMF.\n\nIf the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee. No CA will be conducted.\n\nDefinitions\n\nActive pharmaceutical ingredient24 (as defined by GDUFA):**\n\nFootnote 24: Section 744A(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\n(A) A substance, or a mixture when the substance is unstable or cannot be transported on its own, intended\n\n(i) to be used as a component of a drug; and\n\n(ii) to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure,\n\nmitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any\n\nfunction of the human body; or\n\n(B) a substance intended for final crystallization, purification, or salt formation, or any\n\ncombination of those activities, to become a substance or mixture described in\n\nsubparagraph (A).\n\nActive DMF: A drug master file (DMF) for which the FDA has made a determination that the\n\nDMF was acceptable for filing administratively and is up to date.\n\nDMF holder:25 Designated owner of the DMF, which may be different from the U.S. agent\n\nlisted as the contact.\n\nFootnote 25: See 21 CFR 314.420(a).\n\nGeneric drug submission:26 An abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to\n\nan ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS.\n\nLetter of authorization (LOA):27 A written statement by the holder or designated U.S. agent or\n\nrepresentative permitting FDA to refer to information in the DMF in support of another\n\nperson's28 generic drug submission.\n\nFootnote 28: Section 744A(12) of the FD&C Act; also see 21 CFR 314.420(a)(2).\n\nType II Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Drug Master Files:29 The submission of API\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6688386797904968", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: VII What are my responsibilities as a DMF holder?\n\nAs a DMF holder you have a number of obligations. Failure to meet these obligations may delay approval of applications that rely on the information in your DMF or result in the Agency closing your DMF. The following discusses your responsibilities.\n\nChanges to your DMF\n\nAny addition, deletion, or change to information in your DMF is required to be submitted to the Agency in duplicate (21 CFR 314.420(c)). This includes changes you formerly reported to the Agency under 21 CFR 314.70 when the information was part of an approved bulk application. The submission describing the change should include appropriate cross-references to the affected information in previous submissions, including the date(s), volume(s), section(s), and/or page number(s). Additionally, you must notify each person (applicant) authorized to reference information in your DMF of pertinent changes (21 CFR 314.420(c)). Notification should be provided well in advance to give the affected persons (applicants) ample time to amend or supplement their applications as necessary under 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nAnnual Update\n\nYou should update your DMF on an annual basis. The update should identify all changes and additional information incorporated into your DMF since the previous update. If no changes were made to your DMF, you should provide a statement that the information remains current. For more information on annual updates see CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\n\nListing of Persons Authorized to Reference your DMF\n\nYour DMF must contain a complete list of persons currently authorized to reference information in your DMF (21 CFR 314.420(d)). For more information on this topic see CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\nIf you have an appointed agent for your DMF, you should include a signed letter of appointment in your DMF that includes the agent's name, address, and scope of responsibility (administrative and/or scientific).\n\nAppendix E Transfer of Ownership\n\nIf you intend to transfer ownership of your DMF to another party, you should notify the Agency and persons authorized to reference the DMF (applicants) in writing. Details regarding information to be included in the letter are provided in CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\n\nAppendix F Incorporation of Information into a Dosage Form Application\n\nIf you do not wish to maintain a DMF, the information may be filed as part of one or more dosage form applications (IND, NDA, or ANDA). The dosage form applicant is then responsible for ensuring this information meets regulatory requirements. If the information is certified as being current and there have been no changes, it may be submitted to the dosage form application(s) as an annual report. If the information is not current or changes have been made, the DMF information should be filed as (1) a prior approval supplement, changes being effected supplement, or annual report for an NDA or ANDA or (2) an information amendment or annual report for an IND. The reporting category would depend on the nature of the change.\n\nGLOSSARY\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Master Files for Bulk Antibiotic Drug Substances Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.1383686512708664"], "According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to several requests submitted to the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub PR, FDA temporarily - deferred a GRAS/GRAE - determination - for three active ingredients--benzalkonium chloride, - ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol-to allow time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill - the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified - for these ingredients.\n\nAs a result of the deferrals, the Consumer - Antiseptic - Rub FR does not include - a determination - on the GRAS/GRAE status of benzalkonium - chloride, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol for use in consumer antiseptic - rubs. FDA intends to address the GRAS/GRAE - status of these three active ingredients - either after completion - and analysis of studies to fill - the identified - safety and effectiveness data gaps for these ingredients - or at another time if these studies are not completed.6\n\nFootnote 6: The CARES Act added section 505G to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C Act). Under 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as category III in a tentative final monograph (TFM), including the 1994 TFM for over-the-counter topical antiseptic (59 FR 31402) - as further amended by the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub proposed rule (81 FR 42912) - are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM and comply with all other applicable requirements for nonprescription drugs.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR covers OTC consumer antiseptic - rub products - that are sometimes - referred to as rubs, leave-on products, or hand sanitizers. The Consumer AntisepticRub FR also covers OTC consumer antiseptic - wipes. These products are intended to be used when soap and water are not available - and are left on and not rinsed off with water.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR does not address the monograph - status of other OTC antiseptic - products, including: (1) consumer antiseptic - washes, which are personal care products - that are intended - for use with water and are rinsed off after use, such as antibacterial - soaps, antibacterial - hand washes, and antibacterial - body - washes; (2) health care antiseptic, which are antiseptic - products that are intended for use by health care professionals - in a hospital setting or other health care situations - outside of the hospital; (3) first aid antiseptic, - which are skin antiseptic, skin-wound - cleansers, and skin-wound - protectants used primarily - by consumers for first aid use; and (4) antiseptic - used by the food industry. - The monograph - status of the active ingredients - intended for use in these other OTC antiseptic - products - has been and/or will be addressed separately.\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR?\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, we found that three active ingredients - were eligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review for use in a consumer antiseptic - rub. The three ingredients - are:\n\nEthyl alcohol\n\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\nAs noted above, FDA temporarily - deferred - a final determination - regarding the GRAS/GRAE - status of these three active ingredients - to allow time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill - the safety and effectiveness data gaps - identified - for these ingredients.\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, we also found 28 active ingredients - ineligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic - rub. The 28 ingredients - are:\n\ncetyl phosphate\n\nChloroxylenol\n\nCloflucarban\n\npotassium vegetable oil solution, phosphate sequestering agent, and triethanolamine\n\nFluorosalan\n\nHexachlororphene\n\nHexylesercinol\n\nIodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)\n\nIodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)\n\nMethylbenzothium chloride\n\nNonylphenoxyypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine\n\nPhenol (equal to or less than 1.5 percent or greater than 1.5 percent)\n\nPoloxamer iodine complex\n\nPolyhexamethylene biguanide\n\nPovidone-iodine (5 to 10 percent)\n\nSalicylic acid\n\nSecondary amyltricresols\n\nSodium hypochlorite\n\nSodium oxychlorosene\n\nTea Tree Oil\n\nTribromsalan\n\nTrickocarban\n\nTrickosan\n\nTriple dye\n\nUndecoylium chloride iodine complex\n\nWhen and how do manufacturers have to comply with this final rule?\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, FDA found 28 active ingredients - ineligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic - rub. On or after the April 13, 2020, effective date of the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, any OTC consumer antiseptic - rub drug product containing - one or more of the 28 ingredients - that FDA has found ineligible - cannot be introduced or delivered for introduction - into interstate commerce unless the drug product is the subject of an approved NDA or ANDA. This means that manufacturers will need to obtain an NDA or ANDA to market consumer antiseptic - rub drug products containing - any of these 28 active ingredients. Alternatively, manufacturers of consumer antiseptic - rubs containing - antiseptic - active ingredients - can comply with the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR by removing their products from the market, or reformulating - them to remove the ineligible - active ingredients, - and then marketing - them appropriately (e.g., by substituting - one of the three active ingredients - described above or by marketing - the products as antiseptic-free - rubs or wipes without drug claims).\n\nWhat if my OTC antiseptic product uses an active ingredient not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub final rule?\n\nOTC consumer antiseptic - rub or wipe products containing - active ingredients not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR are considered new drugs, for which an approved NDA or ANDA is required before marketing such products. Manufacters of such products can also pursue one of the alternatives - explained in Q3 to comply - with this final rule.\n\nWhy did FDA not address final formulation - testing or labeling in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR?\n\nWe did not address final product formulation - testing or labeling - requirements in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR because none of the consumer antiseptic - rub active ingredients - that are the subject of the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR were found to be GRAS/GRAE - for use in consumer antiseptic - rub products. Final formulation - testing and labeling - for the three deferred active ingredients - may be addressed in the future once their GRAS/GRAE - determination - has been concluded.\n\nWhy were three consumer antiseptic - rub active ingredients deferred from further rulemaking?\n\nFDA temporarily - deferred a final determination - on the GRAS/GRAE status of - three active ingredients - used in consumer antiseptic -benzyl-benzkonium - chloride, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol--to allow time for interested parties to complete - the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified - for these ingredients. - FDA made the decision - to defer that determination - in response to several requests submitted - to the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub PR.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the Consumer Antiseptic Rub FR should be directed to CDERCompliance@fda.hhs.gov. Questions regarding other OTC issues should be directed to OTCDrugs@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Consumer Antiseptic Rub Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.35309094190597534", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA's specific recommendations on the data and information needed to support a positive GRASE determination under the SIA are detailed in sections II (pharmaceutical quality/manufacturing information), III (safety data), and IV (effectiveness data). Section V presents FDA's current thinking on an approach to safety testing of final sunscreen formulations that it anticipates adopting in the future.\n\nAlthough sunscreen products are typically formulated with two or more active ingredients, the recommendations in sections II through IV generally contemplate that testing will be performed using formulations including one active ingredient FDA anticipates that these data would also generally be sufficient to assess whether, and under what conditions, that active ingredient is GRASE for use as part of a combination of sunscreen active ingredients. In some situations, additional data and testing beyond what is recommended in this guidance may be needed to support a positive GRASE determination and to establish the associated conditions for a particular active ingredient. The following are examples in which additional data may be needed:\n\nData suggest that there may be a safety or efficacy concern with a particular combination of active ingredients or active and inactive ingredients\n\nInformation indicates that an active ingredient is unstable when exposed to sunlight and suggests that the active ingredient may need to be combined with a photostabilizer to be safe or effective\n\nOther situations may occur in which additional data are needed (see, e.g., section III for some additional examples). Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA any questions about whether additional data may be needed for a particular active ingredient.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Pharmaceutical Quality/Manufacturing Information\n\nFDA needs information that sufficiently characterizes the identity of each sunscreen active ingredient for FDA reviewers to determine how, if at all, the safety and efficacy studies submitted for review are relevant to the ingredient for which GRASE determination is sought.10 This information would also be needed to appropriately characterize the active ingredient in the final sunscreen order. Sponsors should provide the compendial status of the ingredient, including reference to a United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary monograph. Sponsors should also provide any known chemical and/or manufacturing characteristics of the active ingredient that may be relevant to FDA's GRASE evaluation and to the establishment of the conditions of any resulting final sunscreen order.11 Such information should include known interactions with other sunscreen active ingredient(s) or commonly used sunscreen vehicle component(s) and particle size information for micronized or nanoscale active ingredients. In addition, sponsors should describe any aspects of formulation that are needed to ensure stability, or other characteristics of the active ingredient that are needed to establish conditions under which it is GRASE for use in sunscreens.\n\nFootnote 11: The determination of whether a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE and not misbranded also requires the Agency to describe the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see, e.g., section 586C(e) of the FD&C Act; see also section V of this document).\n\n3 Safety Data\n\nFDA's OTC drug regulations identify both the general types of safety information that sponsors should submit as evidence that an OTC drug is GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(2))) and the standard by which such safety information is to be judged (SS 330.10(a)(4)(i)). When applying these regulations to a given active ingredient, FDA uses its scientific expertise to determine what constitutes \"adequate tests by methods reasonably applicable to show the drug is safe under the prescribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use.\"12\n\nFootnote 12: \u00a7 330.10(a)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recognizes the contribution that broad spectrum sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) value of 15 or higher can make to decrease the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun if used as directed with other sun protection measures. To protect the public health, it is also important for FDA to balance the potential benefits of these sunscreen products to consumers against their potential risks. Providing an adequate safety margin13 for OTC sunscreen active ingredients and finished sunscreen products is a key element of FDA's risk assessment. When determining the specific testing and other data needed to adequately demonstrate that an OTC sunscreen active ingredient is safe, FDA considers both the circumstances under which OTC sunscreen products are intended to be used by consumers and current scientific knowledge and assessment technology.\n\nFootnote 13: For drugs with a known potential for adverse effects based on animal data, the anticipated level of risk for humans may be quantified using a safety margin calculation. A safety margin calculation takes the highest animal no observed adverse effect level and estimates a maximum safe level of exposure for humans. One caveat to the safety margin calculation is that animal studies do not always predict effects in humans, and the actual threshold for an effect in humans may be different (higher or lower) than in the species tested. The human sensitivity to a drug is often unknown. To account for this, the predicted safe exposure level in humans that is reflected in the safety margin is well below where toxicities were seen in animals.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nHuman dermal safety studies for topical products in which exposure to light after application is anticipated generally consist of two sets of studies--those conducted without specific exposure to light and those conducted to assess reactions after ultraviolet exposure (photosafety studies).17 These study sets usually consist of dermal irritation patch testing, dermal sensitization patch testing, dermal phototoxicity testing, and dermal photoallergenicity testing.\n\nFootnote 17: See the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidancCompilanceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nBecause marketed sunscreen products typically contain a combination of active ingredients and because brand name product formulations frequently change, it is difficult for FDA to determine causal links between individual active ingredients and reported irritation and hypersensitivity adverse events associated with a particular product. Therefore, FDA generally expects to use data from human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and human photosafety studies, in conjunction with postmarketing adverse event data, to inform GRASE determinations and labeling. Nonetheless, in some cases, depending on the rigor of available postmarketing safety information, it may be reasonable for sponsors to omit human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and/or human photosafety studies. For example, if FDA concludes that there is a positive risk-benefit for a sunscreen active ingredient but that it is known to be a sensitizer, it may be possible to develop safety labeling to address this risk without data generated in the human dermal safety studies described below. Sponsors who believe there is a scientific rationale that may preclude the need for some or all of the described studies are urged to contact FDA before initiating studies.\n\na. Human irritation and sensitization studies\n\nStudies of skin irritation and sensitization that use the repeat insult patch test or other relevant tests are recommended elements in FDA's safety evaluation of topical drug products that, like sunscreens, are applied to the skin repeatedly over long periods of time. These tests, which are designed to detect the potential of topical drug products for local dermatologic events with fewer subjects than might be observed in larger clinical trials, often involve applying product more frequently and/or for longer durations than the proposed clinical dosing of those drug products. In dermal irritation studies, a test substance is applied to a small pad (patch) and affixed to the test subject's skin, usually on the back, to determine whether the ingredient causes direct skin toxicity. Dermal sensitization studies are conducted similarly but are designed to detect immunologically mediated reactions, which require prior exposure to the allergen.\n\nNonprescription sunscreen active ingredients, when found to be GRASE, may be used in numerous, as yet unknown, product formulations. Therefore, FDA recommends that cumulative irritation studies evaluate (1) the proposed sunscreen active ingredient at the highest concentration for which a GRASE determination is sought, in an appropriate vehicle; (2) the vehicle alone; (3) a negative control; and (4) a positive control. The evaluation should include scoring of erythema, edema, and a popular response or skin erosion.\n\nSkin sensitization studies, conducted to detect immunologically mediated reactions, should be conducted in the following three phases:\n\nThe induction phase (three weekly applications for 3 weeks)\n\nThe rest phase (no product application for 10 to 14 days)\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products \u2013 Safety and Effectiveness Data \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.643611431121826", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: Waivers,\n\nExceptions, and\n\nExempltions From the\n\nRequirements of Section\n\n582 of the Federal Food,\n\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nAugust 2023\n\nAdministrative/Procedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWaivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions From the Requirements of\n\nSection 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Compliance in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes the process an authorized2 trading partner3 or other stakeholder should use to request a waiver, exception, or exemption from the requirements of section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1), as amended by the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54). This guidance also describes the factors the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to consider when evaluating such requests from an authorized trading partner or other stakeholder, and when determining FDA-initiated exceptions and exemptions. Additionally, this guidance describes the process the FDA intends to follow once every two years to review and make determinations on the appropriateness of renewing a previously approved waiver, exception, or exemption, where applicable. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, issued in May 2018 as required by section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act. The revisions described in this document update the policy articulated in the May 2018 draft guidance.\n\nFootnote 2: Authorized is defined in section 581(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 3: Trading partner is defined in section 581(23) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, the provisions of sections 582(b)-(e) of the FD&C Act do not impose requirements on those entities.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe DSCSA outlines critical steps to enhance drug distribution security. These steps will ultimately allow tracing of certain human finished prescription drugs in an electronic, interoperable manner as they are distributed within the United States (U.S.). Section 582 of the FD&C Act, as amended by the DSCSA, applies to manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors and dispensers (collectively referred to as \"trading partners\") who engage in transactions of product,4 and outlines requirements related to product tracing, verification, product identification, and authorized trading partners.\n\nFootnote 4: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(a)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act requires the FDA to issue a guidance that:\n\n(i) establish[es] a process by which an authorized manufacturer, repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser may request a waiver from any of the requirements set forth in [section 582 of the FD&C Act], which the Secretary may grant if the Secretary determines that such requirements would result in an undue economic hardship or for emergency medical reasons, including a public health emergency declaration pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service Act; 5\n\n(ii) establish[es] a process by which the Secretary determines exceptions, and a process through which a manufacturer or repackager may request such an exception, to the requirements relating to product identifiers if a product is packaged in a container too small or otherwise unable to accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear the information required for compliance with [section 582 of the FD&C Act]; and\n\n(iii) establish[es] a process by which the Secretary may determine other products or transactions that shall be exempt from the requirements of [section 582 of the FD&C Act].\n\nAdditionally, section 582(a)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act requires the FDA to issue guidance that includes a process on how the FDA intends to review and renew granted waivers, exceptions, and exemptions.\n\nIII Process for submitting waiver, exception, or exemption requests to FDA\n\nThis section provides essential information that describes the process to submit a waiver, exception, or exemption request to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) or to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). FDA recommends that all correspondence between FDA and a trading partner or other stakeholder, including submission of an initial request and subsequent communication associated with an initial or granted request, be exchanged electronically in a manner that is consistent with the procedures articulated in section III.C. of this document.\n\nEntities that May Submit a Request\n\nOnly an authorized manufacturer, repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser6 may request a waiver under section 582(a)(3)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act, and only a manufacturer or repackager may request an exception under section 582(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.7 Any interested stakeholder may request an exemption under section 582(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Manufacturer, wholesale distributor, dispenser, and repackager are defined in sections 581(10), (29), (3), and (16) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 7: An authorized representative of a trading partner, such as legal counsel and consultants, may submit a waiver or exception request on behalf of the trading partner.\n\nInformation to Include in a Request\n\n1.1.1 Request-specific Information\n\nEach request should include the following information:\n\nName, telephone number, and email address of an individual who FDA can contact about matters relating to the proposed waiver, exception, or exemption8 Footnote 8: It is the responsibility of the requesting trading partner or other stakeholder to inform FDA of changes in contact information.\n\nName and address of the trading partner(s) that the proposed waiver, exception, or exemption would cover Footnote 8: It is the responsibility of the requesting trading partner or other stakeholder to inform FDA of changes in contact information.\n\nDescription of the activities and/or products (including the product name and National Drug Code number) for which the proposed waiver, exception, or exemption is being sought\n\nIdentification of the specific statutory provision(s) of section 582 of the FD&C Act to which the proposed waiver, exception, or exemption would apply\n\nDescription of the measures or controls that will be implemented to ensure thesafety and security of the drug supply chain while operating under a waiver, exception, or exemption\n\nRequested effective period (e.g., start and end date) of the proposed waiver, exception, or exemption\n\nUnique or special circumstances of a product and/or transaction\n\nDetailed statement describing the reason(s) justifying the proposed waiver, exception, or exemption request as well as pertinent supporting documentation, as applicable, to support the request\n\nii.2.2 Attestation\n\nIn addition, please affirm the following statement in your request:\n\nI affirm that the information in this statement is correct, and I understand that under 18 U.S.C. 1001 it is illegal to make a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in this matter within FDA's jurisdiction.\n\nAppendix C How to Submit a Request\n\nFDA recommends that an authorized trading partner or other stakeholder seeking a waiver, exception, or exemption from requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act submit an electronic request to FDA. FDA strongly encourages electronic submission to facilitate efficiency and timeliness of submission and review. A table is provided in the Appendix to summarize where requests and subsequent communication associated with an initial or granted request should be submitted. Following the submission of a request, FDA intends to provide the trading partner or other stakeholder an acknowledgement confirming receipt of the request.\n\nc.1.1 Submissions to FDA for CBER-regulated Products\n\nA request for a waiver, exception, or exemption for products that CBER reviews should be submitted as product correspondence to the biologics license application (BLA), new drug application (NDA), or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) in the electronic common technical document (eCTD) format.9\n\nFootnote 9: See the guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2014 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (February 2020).

The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists (originally issued Jan. 31, 2020, and subsequently renewed), _available at_https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), _available at_https://trumpwhitechouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nHypercoagulability, an abnormally increased risk for blood clotting, has been observed in patients with COVID-19. Laboratory abnormalities commonly observed among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy include: mild thrombocytopenia, increased D-dimer levels, increased fibrin degradation products, and prolonged prothrombin time.3 Hypercoagulability has been most notably reported in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).4 FDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the availability and capability of coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties. Coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties can help identify changes in coagulation status and are used routinely as an aid in the assessment of hemostasis in the perioperative period of select surgical procedures and in the assessment of bleeding and thrombosis following a traumatic injury or event. Modified use of these devices in hospital patient healthcare settings may increase access to important examination of whole blood viscoelastic properties to facilitate patient management by healthcare providers during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThe enforcement policy described in Section IV of this guidance applies to the legally marketed coagulation systems listed in Table 1 intended for use in measuring the dynamics of clot formation, firmness, and dissolution as affected by the kinetics of thrombin generation, platelet activation, fibrin generation, clot strength, clot stability, and inhibitory effects in whole blood, and that have been subsequently modified to facilitate patient management by healthcare providers during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The output for these coagulation systems consists of semi-quantitative results and a graphical display (e.g., tracing or curve) that demonstrates the kinetic changes of whole blood as it clots over time.\n\nIV. Policy\n\nAs hypercoagulability has been observed in patients with COVID-19, FDA recognizes the importance and utility of increased availability of devices to test for and manage coagulopathies in patients in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, which are experiencing increased patient load due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. In developing this policy, FDA's intent is to foster the continued availability of safe and effective medical devices while being flexible regarding certain modifications made to coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties to include use in hospital patient healthcare settings in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Currently, coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties have not been cleared or approved for use in hospital patient healthcare settings. FDA recognizes that expanded use of coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties may help facilitate the assessment of hemostasis beyond the perioperative and trauma settings. Thus, FDA does not intend to object to limited modifications to the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline\nDevice Type & Classification Regulation & Product Code & Class \\ \\hline Multipurpose system for in vitro coagulation studies & 21 CFR 864.5425 & JPA5 & II \\ \\hline Coagulation system for the measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties & 21 CFR 864.54306  & QFR & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1:indications, functionality, hardware, and/or software of the coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties that are within the scope of this guidance as identified in Section III, without prior submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.81,7 where the modification does not create an undue risk to the patient in light of the public health emergency.8 This policy applies where a modification is made to the device that would typically require that a manufacturer submit a new 510(k) submission to FDA.\n\nFootnote 7: For further guidance on modifications that trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a new premarket notification (510(k)) to FDA, refer to \u201cDeciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-change-existing-device.\n\nFootnote 8: Certain modifications to the indications, functionality, or hardware or software of the exempt devices in Table 1 may require premarket notification subject to the limitations of the exemption under 21 CFR 864.9.\n\nManufacturers must document changes to their device in their device master record and change control records and make this information available to FDA, if requested, as required by 21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.180.\n--------------------\nContext title: Coagulation Systems for Measurement of Viscoelastic Properties- Enforcement Policy During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (Revised) Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.210754871368408", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023, unless superseded by a revised final guidance before that date.

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability of telethermographic systems used for body temperature measurements for triage use for the duration of the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by HHS, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled \"Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019,\" _available at_https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 371(h)(1)(C)) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists. (Jan. 31, 2020), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/2019-nCoV_aspx).\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nFever is a common symptom of COVID-19, typically appearing 2-14 days after exposure.3 Telethermographic systems are able to determine surface skin temperature, which is then used to estimate the temperature at a reference body site (e.g., oral, tympanic membrane). The advantage of using telethermographic systems for initial temperature assessment for triage use is the potential use in high throughput areas (e.g., airports, businesses, warehouses, factories) and in settings where other temperature assessment products may be in short supply. The available scientific literature supports the use of telethermographic systems in the context of initial human temperature measurement during such a triage process.4 Additionally, international standards and scientific literature have described guidelines for using telethermographic systems for initial temperature assessment for triage use and best practices for standardized performance testing of such products.5,6,7\n\nFootnote 3: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html.\n\nFootnote 4: Ring, Francis J., and E.

CRC press, 2007.\n\nFootnote 5: ISO/TR 13154:2017: Medical electrical equipment \u2014 Deployment, implementation and operational guidelines for identifying febrile humans using a screening thermograph.\n\nFDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance may help address urgent public health concerns raised by shortages of temperature measurement products by helping to clarify the regulatory landscape and expand the availability of telethermographic systems used for initial body temperature measurements for triage use during this public health emergency.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThere are many products marketed in the United States as telethermographic systems that detect infrared radiation and convert such measurements into a temperature measurement.\n\nTelethermographic systems that meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)) are regulated by FDA.\n\nGenerally, telethermographic systems fall within the definition of a device when they are intended for a medical purpose, including for use by health care professionals or others for body temperature assessment.8 Telethermographic systems that are not intended for a medical purpose are not medical devices as described in further detail below.\n\nFootnote 8: As used in this guidance \u201cintended for a medical purpose\u201d means that the device is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and, therefore, meets the definition of \u201cdevice\u201d set forth in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)).\n\nThe enforcement policy in this guidance applies to telethermographic systems that are intended for adjunctive diagnostic screening during the COVID-19 pandemic. These products may be devices that are regulated under 21 CFR 884.2980(a), product code LHQ,9 and have been modified as explained below, or products that normally are not considered devices under the FD&C Act, but that may be used for a medical purpose during the COVID-19 pandemic to address availability concerns of such products.\n\nFootnote 9: Currently regulated telethermographic systems are identified under product code LHQ, and are class I devices subject to premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)).\n\nIV.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats including emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability and capability of sterilizers, disinfectant devices, and air purifiers during this public health emergency.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled \"Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019,\" _available at_https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because the FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)).

Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nSARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated the capability to spread rapidly, leading to significant impacts on health care systems and causing societal disruption. The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States. To respond effectively to the COVID-19 outbreak, appropriate clinical management and infection control in conjunction with implementation of community mitigation efforts are critical.\n\nFDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to increase the availability of sterilizers, disinfect devices, and air purifiers during this public health emergency. Increased access to these devices may facilitate rapid turnaround of sterilized or disinfected medical equipment and reduce the risk of viral exposure for patients and health care providers to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M Azar, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists. (Jan. 31, 2020), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/2019-nCoV_aspx).\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThe enforcement policies described in this guidance apply to the following devices and their accessories during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This enforcement policy applies to devices that already have FDA marketing authorization, as well as devices that are not currently marketed but would fall under one of the classification regulations set forth below.\n\nA Sterilizers\n\nSterilizers for use in a health care facility are medical devices that are regulated by FDA and are intended to render medical devices sterile (i.e., free from viable microorganisms). Sterilizers vary in both construction (ranging from small table-top sterilizers to large sterilizers intended for large loads) and modality (e.g., steam, ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, etc.). FDA evaluates and authorizes sterilizers for marketing with specific cycle parameters intended for specific loads and with their own sterilization accessories (e.g., biological indicators, chemical indicators, wraps, trays,\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]\n\n2 Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfecting Devices\n\nUV disinfecting devices are devices that use UVA or UVC light to produce a germicidal effect. They are intended to augment disinfection of health care environmental surfaces after manual cleaning has been performed. UV disinfecting devices include UV radiation chamber disinfection devices, which are regulated as Class II devices under 21 CFR 880.6600 (product code OSZ).8\n\nFootnote 8: Subject to special controls.\n\nAppendix C Air Purifiers\n\nAir purifying devices are intended for medical purposes to kill pathogens/microorganisms in the air by exposure to UV radiation or remove them through filtration. The classification regulations and associated product codes for air purifying devices, to which the policy in this guidance applies, are listed in Table 3:\n\nAppendix H Policy\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency, it is necessary to maintain an adequatesupply of sterilizers, disinfectant devices, and air purifiers that can facilitate rapid turnaround of sterilized or disinfected medical equipment and that help reduce the risk of viral exposure for patients and health care providers to SARS-CoV-2. FDA believes that certain sterilizers, disinfectant devices, and air purifiers falling within the scope of this guidance (see Section III) may help reduce this risk of viral exposure based on our current understanding of these devices and SARS-CoV-2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Sterilizers, Disinfectant Devices, and Air Purifiers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.4066481590271"], "With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: Under what circumstances may QAU audit reports be inspected by FDA? Is there any requirement to maintain these reports or can they be discarded?\n\nQU audit reports as a matter of administrative policy are exempt from routine FDA inspection. FDA's access to QAU audit reports would be through the Courts should the subject matter of those reports be litigated. Since there is no FDA requirement that these reports be maintained, the disposition of these reports is up to the firm's management. FDA advises that such records not be destroyed without the firm seeking advice from its legal counsel.\n4. What are the quality assurance unit inspection requirements for acute and short-term studies?\n\nFor studies lasting less than 4 weeks, each final report should be reviewed by the quality assurance unit for accuracy. With regard to the in process phases (dose preparation, dose administration, in vivo observation and measurement, necropsy, etc.), a random sampling approach could be used so that over a series of studies each critical phase has been monitored. The random sampling approach should be statistically designed so that it is adequate for revealing GLP deviations. The approach and its justification should be made a part of the standard operating procedures of the quality assurance unit.\n5. What constitutes proper quality assurance unit inspection of each phase of a nonclinical laboratory study?A variety of procedures are acceptable for performing a quality assurance unit inspection. The GLPs do not mandate specific procedures. The development of an acceptable procedure should not necessarily be limited to but should consider the following:\n\n(a) nonclinical laboratory studies lasting longer than 6 months should be inspected every 3 months; whereas, studies lasting less than 6 months should be inspected at suitable intervals,\n\n(b) each phase of the study should be inspected,\n\n(c) inspection reports are to be submitted to management and to the study director, and\n\n(d) the purpose of the inspections is to identify significant problems, which may affect study integrity, and to determine that no changes from approved protocols or standard operating procedures were made without proper authorization.\n\nThe phases of a particular study will be determined by the nature of the study. For example, the phases of a typical feeding study include the following:\n\nprotocol development and approval\n\ntest article characterization\n\ntest article stability determination\n\ntest article-carrier mixture preparation\n\ntest article-carrier mixture sampling\n\ntest article-carrier mixture homogeneity determination\n\ntest system quarantine\n\ntest system allocation to housing\n\ntest article carrier mixture distribution to test system\n\nperiodic measurements\n\nanimal observations\n\nfood consumption\n\nbody weights\n\nblood sampling -- hematology and clinical chemistry\n\nnecropsy -- histopathology\n\nstatistical analyses and report preparation\n\nThe type of inspection will depend on the nature of the phase. Each phase must be inspected at least once during the study; the times selected for inspection should be those most likely to reveal problems before the quality of the data generated could be adversely affected.\n\nCould you take a typical subacute 14-day study and define the phases?Phases in a short term study (depending on the type) would include protocol preparation, dose preparation, animal allocation, test system dosage, animal observation, necropsy, data recording, data analysis and final report writing.\n\nBy what authority may the Agency examine master schedule sheets for studies, which may never be used in support of an application for a research or marketing permit?\n\nStudies that are not intended to be used to support an application for a research or marketing permit are not covered by the GLPs and need not appear on the master schedule sheet. If however, the studies are intended to be submitted, then they should be listed and can be inspected by the Agency under its authority to evaluate the results of studies designed to demonstrate product safety.\n\nAre acute studies to be included on the master schedule sheet?\n\nYes, if they fall within the scope of the GLPs.\n\nIn regard to the master schedule sheet, can the \"current status of each study\" be satisfied by listing the starting date and completion date of the study? Can the \"status of the final report\" be satisfied by listing the estimated or actual date of issuance of the final report?\n\nAlthough the GLPs do not specify entries for \"current status of each study,\" dates alone would not be adequate. Suggested entries that are possible include \"study proceeding according to protocol,\" \"study proceeding according to protocol as amended on such-and-such date,\" \"study terminated due to such-and-such,\" etc. Likewise, entries for the status of the final report might include \"awaiting final hematology report,\" \"data in statistical analysis,\" \"first draft prepared,\" \"draft under circulation for review and comment,\" etc.\n\nIn our laboratory, critical operations for all studies are carried out by the same individuals using essentially similar procedures. Would it be adequate for the quality assurance unit to inspect a set of representative operations for GLP and standard operating procedure compliance that would incorporate a good cross-section of studies?\n\nNo, but refer to the answer under question 4 above.\n\nIn reference to the quality assurance unit review of the final report, you have indicated that not all numbers have to be traced. Do you have in mind a standard, which describes an acceptable level of accuracy, e.g., 90%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%?The quality assurance unit review is to ensure that the final report accurately reflects the raw data. Inasmuch as final reports of certain long-term studies can encompass several hundred thousand observations, it would be a prodigious exercise for the quality assurance unit to verify and trace all raw data. Further, the Agency did not mean to require that the quality assurance unit review would include a check of the accuracy of the calculations used to arrive at the final report. This activity would be redundant since the contributing scientists would have already done so in preparing their reports. Rather, the review was expected to be of sufficient depth to reveal inaccuracies in the final report. Consequently, the Agency envisioned the development of a statistically based system, whereby; a random sample of the results in the final report is traced. The procedure should be made a part of the standard operating procedures. The Agency has not established an acceptable level of accuracy of the trace.\n\nIs the master schedule sheet intended to be prospective or historical? If it is historical, what is the required retention period?\n\nThe master schedule sheet is intended to include a listing of all nonclinical laboratory studies currently in progress as well as those which have been conducted during the terms specified in section 58.195 of the GLPs.\n* Does the master schedule sheet have to list studies on compounds for which no data has yet been submitted to the Agency?\n\nYes. The GLPs cover all nonclinical laboratory studies of Agency regulated products that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits.\n* The GLPs state that the quality assurance unit should assure that the final report reflects the study results. Is it required that every final report be reviewed by the quality assurance unit?\n\nYes. This procedure helps to ensure the accuracy of the final report.\n* Does the quality assurance unit review of each final study report have to be reported to management?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.712054967880249", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: QA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n\nUnder a quality system, it is normally expected that the product and process development units, the manufacturing units, and the QU will remain independent. In very limited circumstances, a single individual can perform both production and quality functions. That person is still accountable for implementing all the controls and reviewing the results of manufacture to ensure that product quality standards have been met. Under such circumstances, it is recommended that another qualified individual, not involved in the production operation, conduct an additional, periodic review of QU activities.\n\nSix-system Inspection Model\n\nThe FDA's Drug Manufacturing Inspection Compliance Program, which contains instructions to FDA personnel for conducting inspections, is a systems-based approach to inspection and is very consistent with the robust quality system model presented in this guidance.9 The diagram below shows the relationship among the six systems: the quality system and the five manufacturing systems. The quality system provides the foundation for the manufacturing systems that are linked and function within it. The quality system model described in this guidance does not consider the five manufacturing systems as discrete entities, but instead integrates them into appropriate sections of the model. Those familiar with the six-system inspection approach will see organizational differences in this guidance; however, the inter-relationship should be readily apparent. One of the important themes of the systems based inspection compliance program is that you have the ability to assess whether each of the systems is in a state of control. The quality system model presented in this guidance will also serve to help firms achieve this state of control.\n\nFootnote 9: See Reference #2; This inspectional approach is currently in use by CDER and by CBER for blood and blood product inspections. CBER and CVM are developing a similar approach for drug product inspections.\n\nThe Quality Systems Model\n\nThe goal of this section is to describe a model for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing that can help manufacturers comply with the CGMP regulations. It should be noted that implementing an effective quality system in a manufacturing organization will require a significant investment of time and resources. However, we believe the long-term benefits of implementing a quality system will outweigh the costs.10\n\nFootnote 10: See Reference #3.\n\nThis section describes a robust quality systems model that, if properly implemented, can provide the controls to consistently produce a product of acceptable quality. Where applicable, the relationship between elements of this model and CGMP regulations is noted. At the end of each section, a table shows how the specific CGMP regulations correlate to the elements in the quality systems model. As already explained, many of the quality systems elements correlate closely with the CGMP regulations. It is important to emphasize that this guidance is not recommending new regulatory requirements. The guidance is intended to provide recommendations to manufacturers who are implementing, or plan to implement, a quality systems model to help them comply with CGMP regulations. FDA regulatory and inspectional coverage will remain focused on the specific CGMP regulations.\n\nThe model is described according to four major factors:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nIn each of the sections that follow, the specific elements of a robust modern quality systems model are described. When elements of the quality systems model correlate with specific CGMP regulations, this correlation is noted.\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nModern robust quality systems models call for management to play a key role in the design, implementation, and management of the quality system. For example, management is responsible for establishing the quality system structure appropriate for the specific organization. Management has ultimate responsibility to provide the leadership needed for the successful functioning of a quality system. This section describes management's role in developing, implementing, and managing a robust quality system. There is some overlap with the CGMP regulations in this section (see the table at the end of the section).\n\niv.1.1 Provide Leadership\n\nIn a robust, modern quality system, senior management should demonstrate commitment to developing and maintaining their quality system. Quality system plans should be aligned with a manufacturer's strategic plans to ensure that the system is part of the manufacturer's mission and quality strategies. For example, quality systems departments normally have equal standing with other departments within an organization. Quality systems staff are effectively integrated into manufacturing activities and are involved in activities such as nonconformance investigations. Senior managers set implementation priorities and develop action plans. All levels of management can provide support of the quality system by:\n\nActively participating in system design, implementation, and monitoring, including system review (see IV.1.5.)\n\nAdvocating continual improvement of operations of the quality system\n\nCommitting necessary resources\n\nIn a robust quality systems environment, all managers should demonstrate strong and visible support for the quality system and ensure its implementation throughout the organization (e.g., across multiple sites).\n\nAll managers should encourage internal communication on quality issues at all levels in the organization. Communication should be ongoing among research and development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, and QU personnel on issues that affect quality, with management included whenever appropriate.\n\niv.1.2 Structure the Organization\n\nWhen designing a robust quality system, management has the responsibility to structure the organization and ensure that assigned authorities and responsibilities support the production, quality, and management activities needed to produce quality products. Senior managers have the responsibility to ensure that the organization's structure is documented.\n\nAll managers have the responsibility to communicate employee roles, responsibilities, and authorities within the system and ensure that interactions are defined and understood.\n\nAn organization also has the responsibility to give the individual who is appointed to manage the quality system the authority to detect problems and implement solutions. Usually, a senior manager administers the quality system and can, thus, ensure that the organization receives prompt feedback on quality issues.\n\niv.1.3 Build Your Quality System to Meet Requirements\n\nImplementing a robust quality system can help ensure compliance with CGMP regulations related to drug safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity. Under the quality systems model, the Agency recommends that senior managers ensure that the quality system that is designed and implemented provides clear organizational guidance and facilitates systematic evaluation of issues. For example, according to the model, when documenting the implementation of a quality system, the following should be addressed:\n\nThe scope of the quality system, including any outsourcing (see IV.1.4.)\n\nThe quality standard that will be followed\n\nThe manufacturer's policies to implement the quality systems criteria and the supporting objectives (see IV.1.4.)(\\bullet) The procedures needed to establish and maintain the quality system\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.884819984436035", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARMONISATION OF TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE\n\nICH HARMONISED TRIPARTITE GUIDELINE\n\nPHARMACEUTICAL QUALITY SYSTEM\n\nQ10\n\nCurrent Step 4 version\n\ndated 4 June 2008\n\nThis Guideline has been developed by the appropriate ICH Expert Working Group and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH Process.

Throughout this guideline, the term \"pharmaceutical quality system\" refers to the ICH Q10 model.\n\nICH Q10 describes one comprehensive model for an effective pharmaceutical quality system that is based on International Standards Organisation (ISO) quality concepts, includes applicable Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations and complements ICH Q8 \"Pharmaceutical Development\" and ICH Q9 \"Quality Risk Management\". ICH Q10 is a model for a pharmaceutical quality system that can be implemented throughout the different stages of a product lifecycle. Much of the content of ICH Q10 applicable to manufacturing sites is currently specified by regional GMP requirements. ICH Q10 is not intended to create any new expectations beyond current regulatory requirements. Consequently, the content of ICH Q10 that is additional to current regional GMP requirements is optional.\n\nICH Q10 demonstrates industry and regulatory authorities' support of an effective pharmaceutical quality system to enhance the quality and availability of medicines around the world in the interest of public health. Implementation of ICH Q10 throughout the product lifecycle should facilitate innovation and continual improvement and strengthen the link between pharmaceutical development and manufacturing activities.\n\nScope\n\nThis guideline applies to the systems supporting the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical drug substances (i.e., API) and drug products, including biotechnology and biological products, throughout the product lifecycle.\n\nThe elements of ICH Q10 should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognising the differences among, and the different goals of each stage (see Section 3).\n\nFor the purposes of this guideline, the product lifecycle includes the following technical activities for new and existing products:\n\nPharmaceutical Development:\n\nDrug substance development;\n\nFormulation development (including container/closure system);\n\nManufacture of investigational products;\n\nDelivery system development (where relevant);\n--------------------\nContext title: Q10 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.317774772644043", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: 1.6.2 Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is integral to an effective pharmaceutical quality system. It can provide a proactive approach to identifying, scientifically evaluating and controlling potential risks to quality. It facilitates continual improvement of process performance and product quality throughout the product lifecycle. ICH Q9 provides principles and examples of tools for quality risk management that can be applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality.\n\n1.7 Design and Content Considerations\n\nThe design, organisation and documentation of the pharmaceutical quality system should be well structured and clear to facilitate common understanding and consistent application.\n\nThe elements of ICH Q10 should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognising the different goals and knowledge available for each stage.\n\nThe size and complexity of the company's activities should be taken into consideration when developing a new pharmaceutical quality system ormodifying an existing one. The design of the pharmaceutical quality system should incorporate appropriate risk management principles. While some aspects of the pharmaceutical quality system can be company-wide and others site-specific, the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality system is normally demonstrated at the site level.\n\nThe pharmaceutical quality system should include appropriate processes, resources and responsibilities to provide assurance of the quality of outsourced activities and purchased materials as described in Section 2.7.\n\nManagement responsibilities, as described in Section 2, should be identified within the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nThe pharmaceutical quality system should include the following elements, as described in Section 3: process performance and product quality monitoring, corrective and preventive action, change management and management review.\n\nPerformance indicators, as described in Section 4, should be identified and used to monitor the effectiveness of processes within the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nQuality Manual\n\nA Quality Manual or equivalent documentation approach should be established and should contain the description of the pharmaceutical quality system. The description should include:\n\nThe quality policy (see Section 2);\n\nThe scope of the pharmaceutical quality system;\n\nIdentification of the pharmaceutical quality system processes, as well as their sequences, linkages and interdependencies. Process maps and flow charts can be useful tools to facilitate depicting pharmaceutical quality system processes in a visual manner;\n\nManagement responsibilities within the pharmaceutical quality system (see Section 2).\n\n2 Management Responsibility\n\nLeadership is essential to establish and maintain a company-wide commitment to quality and for the performance of the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nManagement Commitment\n--------------------\nContext title: Q10 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.62519645690918", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 5: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nThe control strategy provided in the application should include a proposal for use of alternative testing or monitoring approaches in cases of equipment failure. The alternative approach could involve use of end-product testing or other options, while maintaining an acceptable level of quality. Testing or monitoring equipment breakdown should be managed in the context of a deviation under the quality system and can be covered by GMP inspection. (Approved June 2009)\n\nAre product specifications different for minimal versus QbD approaches?\n\nIn principle no, product specifications are the same for minimal and QbD approaches. For a QbD approach, the control strategy can facilitate achieving the end product specifications via real time release testing approaches (see ICH Q8(R2) Annex, appendix 1). Product must meet specification, when tested.6 (Approved October 2009)\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System (3)\n\nQ1: What are the benefits of implementing a pharmaceutical quality system (PQS) (in accordance with ICH Q10)?\n\nThe benefits are:\n\nFacilitated robustness of the manufacturing process, through facilitation of continual improvement through science and risk-based postapproval change processes\n\nConsistency in the global pharmaceutical environment across regions\n\nEnable transparency of systems, processes, and organizational and management responsibility\n\nClearer understanding of the application of a quality system throughout product lifecycle\n\nFurther reducing risk of product failure and incidence of complaints and recalls, thereby providing greater assurance of pharmaceutical product consistency and availability (supply) to the patient\n\nBetter process performance\n\nOpportunity to increase understanding between industry and regulators and more optimal use of industry and regulatory resources; enhance manufacturer's and regulators' confidence in product quality\n\nIncreased compliance with GMPs, which builds confidence in the regulators and may result in shorter inspections (Approved April 2009)\n\nHow does a company demonstrate implementation of PQS in accordance with ICH Q10?\n\nWhen implemented, a company will demonstrate the use of an effective PQS through its documentation (e.g., policies, standards), its processes, its training/qualification, its management, its continual improvement efforts, and its performance against pre-defined key performance indicators (see ICH Q10 glossary on performance indicator).\n\nA mechanism should be established to demonstrate at a site how the PQS operates across the product lifecycle, in an easily understandable way for management, staff, and regulatory inspectors, e.g., a quality manual, documentation, flowcharts, procedures. Companies can implement a program in which the PQS is routinely audited in-house (i.e., internal audit program) to ensure that the system is functioning at a high level. (Approved April 2009)\n* Is it necessary to describe the PQS in a regulatory submission?\n* No, however relevant elements of the PQS (such as quality monitoring system, change control, and deviation management) can be referenced as part of the control strategy as supporting information. (Approved April 2009)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ4:: Will there be certification that the PQS is in accordance with ICH Q10?\n\nA4: No. There will not be a specific ICH Q10 certification program. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ5:: How should the implementation of the design space be evaluated during inspection of the manufacturing site?\n\nA5: Inspection should verify/assess that manufacturing operations are appropriately carried out within the design space. The inspector in collaboration with the assessor, where appropriate, should also verify successful manufacturing operations under the design space and that movement within the design space is managed within the company's change management system (see ICH Q10, section IV. B.3 (3.2), Table III). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ6:: What should be done if manufacturing operations run inadvertently outside of the design space?\n\nA6: This should be handled as a deviation under GMP. For example, unplanned \"one-off\" excursions occurring as a result of unexpected events, such as operator error or equipment failure, would be investigated, documented, and dealt with as a deviation in the usual way. The results of the investigation could contribute to the process knowledge, preventive actions, and continual improvement of the product. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ7:: What information and documentation of the development studies should be available at a manufacturing site?\n\nA7: Pharmaceutical development information (e.g., supporting information on design space, chemometric model, risk management) is available at the development site. Pharmaceutical development information that is useful to ensure the understanding of the basis for the manufacturing process and control strategy, including the rationale for selection of critical process parameters and critical quality attributes, should be available at the manufacturing site. Scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing between pharmaceutical development and manufacturing is essential to ensure the successful transfer to production. (Approved June 2009)\n\nQ8:: Can process parameters be adjusted throughout the product lifecycle?\n\nA8: Process parameters are studied and selected during pharmaceutical development and monitored during commercial manufacturing. Knowledge gained could be utilized for adjustment of the parameters as part of continual improvement of the process throughout the lifecycle of the drug product (see ICH Q10, section IV (3)). (Approved June 2009)\n\nImpact of New ICH Quality Guidance on GMP Inspection Practices (4)\n\nQ1: How will product-related inspections differ in an ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10 environment?\n\nIn the case of product-related inspection (in particular, preauthorization) depending on the complexity of the product and/or process, greater collaboration between inspectors and assessors could be helpful (for example, for the assessment of development data). The inspection would normally occur at the proposed commercial manufacturing site, and there is likely to be greater focus on enhanced process understanding and understanding relationships, e.g., critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters (CPPs). The inspection might also focus on the application and implementation of quality risk management principles, as supported by the pharmaceutical quality system (PQS). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ2: How will system-related inspections differ in an ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 environment?\n\nThe inspection process will remain similar. However, upon the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10, inspections will have greater focus on (but not only focus on) how the PQS facilitates the use of e.g., quality risk management methods, implementation of design space, and change management (see ICH Q10). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ3: How is control strategy approved in the application and evaluated during inspection?\n\nElements of control strategy submitted in the application will be reviewed and approved by the regulatory agency. However, additional elements are subject to inspection (as described in Q10). (Approved October 2009)\n\nKnowledge Management (5)\n\nHow has the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 changed the significance and use of knowledge management?\n\nQ10 defines knowledge management as: \"Systematic approach to acquiring, analyzing, storing, and disseminating information related to products, manufacturing processes and components.\" Knowledge management is not a system; it enables the implementation of the concepts described in ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nKnowledge management is not a new concept. It is always important regardless of the development approach. Q10 highlights knowledge management because it is expected that more complex information generated by appropriate approaches (e.g., QbD, process analytical technology (PAT), real-time data generation, and control monitoring systems) should be better captured, managed, and shared during product life-cycle.\n\nIn conjunction with quality risk management, knowledge management can facilitate the use of concepts such as prior knowledge (including from other similar products), development of design space, control strategy, technology transfer, and continual improvement across the product life cycle. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ2:: Does Q10 suggest an ideal way to manage knowledge?\n\nA2: No. Q10 provides a framework and does not prescribe how to implement knowledge management. Each company decides how to manage knowledge, including the depth and extent of information assessment based on its specific needs. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ3:: What are potential sources of information for knowledge management?\n\nA3: Some examples of knowledge sources are:\n\nPrior knowledge based on experience obtained from similar processes (internal knowledge, industry scientific and technical publications) and published information (external knowledge: literature and peer-reviewed publications)\n\nPharmaceutical development studies\n\nMechanism of action\n\nStructure/function relationships\n\nTechnology transfer activities\n\nProcess validation studies\n\nManufacturing experience, e.g., -- Internal and vendor audits -- Raw material testing data\n\nInnovation\n\nContinual improvement\n\nChange management activities\n\nStability reports\n\nProduct quality reviews/annual product reviews\n\nComplaint reports\n\nAdverse event reports (patient safety)\n\nDeviation reports, recall Information\n\nTechnical investigations and/or CAPA reports\n\nSuppliers and contractors* Product history and /or manufacturing history\n\nOngoing manufacturing processes information (e.g., trends)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q8, Q9, and Q10 Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.848833084106445", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: For the purposes of this guidance, the product lifecycle includes the following technical activities for new and existing products:\n\nPharmaceutical Development\n\nDrug substance development\n\nFormulation development (including container/closure system)\n\nManufacture of investigational products\n\nDelivery system development (where relevant)\n\nManufacturing process development and scale-up\n\nAnalytical method development\n\nTechnology Transfer\n\nNew product transfers during development through manufacturing\n\nTransfers within or between manufacturing and testing sites for marketed products\n\nCommercial Manufacturing\n\nAcquisition and control of materials\n\nProvision of facilities, utilities, and equipment\n\nProduction (including packaging and labeling)\n\nQuality control and assurance\nDistribution (excluding wholesaler activities)\n\nProduct Discontinuation\n\nRetention of documentation\n\nSample retention\n\nContinued product assessment and reporting\n\nB. Relationship of ICH Q10 to Regional GMP Requirements, ISO Standards, and ICH Q7 (1.3)\n\nRegional GMP requirements, the ICH guidance \"Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients,\" and ISO quality management system guidelines form the foundation for ICH Q10. To meet the objectives described below, ICH Q10 augments GMPs by describing specific quality system elements and management responsibilities. ICH Q10 provides a harmonized model for a pharmaceutical quality system throughout the lifecycle of a product and is intended to be used together with regional GMP requirements.\n\nThe regional GMPs do not explicitly address all stages of the product lifecycle (e.g., development). The quality system elements and management responsibilities described in this guidance are intended to encourage the use of science- and risk-based approaches at each lifecycle stage, thereby promoting continual improvement across the entire product lifecycle.\n\n3 Relationship of ICH Q10 to Regulatory Approaches (1.4)\n\nRegulatory approaches for a specific product or manufacturing facility should be commensurate with the level of product and process understanding, the results of quality risk management, and the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality system. When implemented, the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality system can normally be evaluated during a regulatory inspection at the manufacturing site. Potential opportunities to enhance science- and risk-based regulatory approaches are identified in Annex 1. Regulatory processes will be determined by region.\n\n4 ICH Q10 Objectives (1.5)\n\nImplementation of the Q10 model should result in achievement of three main objectives that complement or enhance regional GMP requirements.\n\n1.1 Achieve Product Realization (1.5.1)\n\nTo establish, implement, and maintain a system that allows the delivery of products with the quality attributes appropriate to meet the needs of patients, health care professionals, regulatory authorities (including compliance with approved regulatory filings) and other internal and external customers.\nTo develop and use effective monitoring and control systems for process performance and product quality, thereby providing assurance of continued suitability and capability of processes. Quality risk management can be useful in identifying the monitoring and control systems.\n\n1.2.3 Facilitate Continual Improvement (1.5.3)\n\nTo identify and implement appropriate product quality improvements, process improvements, variability reduction, innovations, and pharmaceutical quality system enhancements, thereby increasing the ability to fulfill a pharmaceutical manufacturer's own quality needs consistently. Quality risk management can be useful for identifying and prioritizing areas for continual improvement.\n\n1.5 Enablers: Knowledge Management and Quality Risk Management (1.6)\n\nUse of knowledge management and quality risk management will enable a company to implement ICH Q10 effectively and successfully. These enablers will facilitate achievement of the objectives described in section 1.2.3 above by providing the means for science- and risk-based decisions related to product quality.\n\n1.5.1 Knowledge Management (1.6.1)\n\nProduct and process knowledge should be managed from development through the commercial life of the product up to and including product discontinuation. For example, development activities using scientific approaches provide knowledge for product and process understanding. Knowledge management is a systematic approach to acquiring, analyzing, storing, and disseminating information related to products, manufacturing processes, and components. Sources of knowledge include, but are not limited to, prior knowledge (public domain or internally documented); pharmaceutical development studies; technology transfer activities; process validation studies over the product lifecycle; manufacturing experience; innovation; continual improvement; and change management activities.\n\n1.5.2 Quality Risk Management (1.6.2)\n\nQuality risk management is integral to an effective pharmaceutical quality system. It can provide a proactive approach to identifying, scientifically evaluating, and controlling potential risks to quality. It facilitates continual improvement of process performance and product quality throughout the product lifecycle. ICH Q9 provides principles and examples of tools for quality risk management that can be applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality.\n\n1.6 Design and Content Considerations (1.7)\n\nThe design, organization, and documentation of the pharmaceutical quality system should be well structured and clear to facilitate common understanding and consistent application.\n\nThe elements of ICH Q10 should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognizing the different goalsand knowledge available for each stage. 3. The size and complexity of the company's activities should be taken into consideration when developing a new pharmaceutical quality system or modifying an existing one. The design of the pharmaceutical quality system should incorporate appropriate risk management principles. While some aspects of the pharmaceutical quality system can be company wide and others site specific, the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality system is normally demonstrated at the site level. 4. The pharmaceutical quality system should include appropriate processes, resources, and responsibilities to provide assurance of the quality of outsourced activities and purchased materials as described in section III.G (2.7). 5. Management responsibilities, as described in section III (2), should be identified within the pharmaceutical quality system. 6. The pharmaceutical quality system should include the following elements, as described in section IV (3): process performance and product quality monitoring, corrective and preventive action, change management, and management review. 7. Performance indicators, as described in section V (4), should be identified and used to monitor the effectiveness of processes within the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nQuality Manual (1.8)\n\nA Quality Manual or equivalent documentation approach should be established and should contain the description of the pharmaceutical quality system. The description should include:\n\nThe quality policy (see section III (2)). 2. The scope of the pharmaceutical quality system. 3. Identification of the pharmaceutical quality system processes, as well as their sequences, linkages, and interdependencies. Process maps and flow charts can be useful tools to facilitate depicting pharmaceutical quality system processes in a visual manner. 4. Management responsibilities within the pharmaceutical quality system (see section III (2)).\n\nIII Management Responsibility (2)\n\nLeadership is essential to establish and maintain a company-wide commitment to quality and for the performance of the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nManagement Commitment (2.1)\n\nSenior management has the ultimate responsibility to ensure an effective pharmaceutical quality system is in place to achieve the quality objectives, and that roles, responsibilities, and authorities are defined, communicated, and implemented throughout the company.\n\nManagement should: 1. Participate in the design, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of an effective pharmaceutical quality system. 2. Demonstrate strong and visible support for the pharmaceutical quality system and ensure its implementation throughout their organization. 3. Ensure a timely and effective communication and escalation process exists to raise quality issues to the appropriate levels of management. 4. Define individual and collective roles, responsibilities, authorities, and interrelationships of all organizational units related to the pharmaceutical quality system. Ensure these interactions are communicated and understood at all levels of the organization. An independent quality unit/structure with authority to fulfill certain pharmaceutical quality system responsibilities is required by regional regulations. 5. Conduct management reviews of process performance and product quality and of the pharmaceutical quality system. 6. Advocate continual improvement. 7. Commit appropriate resources.\n\nQuality Policy (2.2)\n\nSenior management should establish a quality policy that describes the overall intentions and direction of the company related to quality.\n\nThe quality policy should include an expectation to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and should facilitate continual improvement of the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nThe quality policy should be communicated to and understood by personnel at all levels in the company.\n\nThe quality policy should be reviewed periodically for continuing effectiveness.\n\nQuality Planning (2.3)\n\nSenior management should ensure the quality objectives to implement the quality policy are defined and communicated.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.907266616821289"], "This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Assay Migration Studies for\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostic Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA\n\nStaff\n\nDocument issued on: April 25, 2013\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on January 5, 2009.\n\nFor questions regarding this document contact Sally Hojvat, PhD, CDRH/OIR/DMD, by phone at (301) 796-5455, or by email at sally.hojvat@fda.hhs.gov or Marina V.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA's regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term \"new system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term \"old system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA's Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.579517364501953", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Urgent public health need. Diagnostics with a public health impact can address unmet medical needs for both individual patients through early diagnosis, as well as informing the public health response by providing more detailed, timely information on disease incidence. These types of diagnostic assays can provide information on timing of infections (e.g., whether infection occurred within the last 6 months or further into the past). Individuals in the early stage of disease are at highest risk of transmission to their partners, and treatment and contact tracing can be effective in lowering risk. However, in the past, significant barriers existed for properly evaluating the performance of these tests in clinical cohorts. By allowing postmarket data collection to better confirm these tests' medical benefits, uncertainties in the timing of infection can be validated while significantly streamlining the review process for devices with such a public health design scope.\n\nMigration. Migration is an approach used for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrated to another system for which FDA has not evaluated assay performance. The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived for the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an already marketed system. This paradigm uses smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance. For more information, see Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidanc eDocuments/ucm092752.pdf. (\\circ) Example: The migration paradigm is often used on Class III devices for hepatitis to support device performance when the previously approved assay is transferred to a new instrument platform.\n\nConfirm mitigation effectiveness for a known risk in a post-approval study. Mitigations may be necessary for known safety risks associated with use of the device. Confirmation of the adequacy of the mitigation may be evaluated post-approval if mitigation of the risk is not fundamental to FDA's determination at the time of approval that the probable benefits outweigh the probable risks of the device. (\\circ) Example: After a permanent implant was recalled due to failures that could lead to death, a firm developed a novel software feature aimed at predicting those failures. The firm intends to incorporate that feature into its submission for a permanent implant intended for the same use as the recalled implant, which was marketed by a different company. The ability to predict failures would alert at-risk patients to see their clinician (and address the concern) prior to a life-threatening event. FDA might typically expect clinical data in a PMA to support this type of feature before approval. However, due to the public health need, FDA worked with the firm to use modeling on the novel software feature coupled with evaluation of published data to support premarket approval of the PMA. Clinical data on devices with the software feature were collected postmarket in a post-approval study, which was completed in a timely fashion after approval of the PMA. (\\circ) Example: For pacing and defibrillation leads, the degree of the changes in the products themselves and the potential impact to patient safety of those changes can affect the collection of data premarket and postmarket. For major changes (e.g., a completely new design, including new materials, new arrangement of those materials, and/or new connections) there will likely be more questions about impacts to patient safety, and thus a more rigorous set of premarket data (and a smaller degree of uncertainty) would be required before approval as compared to a lead with only minor changes. For example, even when a lead is new or significantly modified, FDA generally only requires 6 months to 2 years of data with a longer post-approval study to demonstrate long-term performance since the safety risks are well known.\n\nModify warnings, contraindications, precautions in approved labeling. Post-approval studies may be designed to collect further data on specific adverse events or event types for which there was limited knowledge during premarket review (e.g., small number of adverse events that occur within a subpopulation or uncertainty relating to the probability of minor adverse events), and the review of the postmarket data may result in revision of the warning, contraindications and/or precautions in the labeling.\n\nExample: When an in vitro diagnostic device is capable of detecting both common and rare targets (e.g., mutations or pathogens), the rare targets may be challenging to evaluate clinically in a timely manner. Such tests may be approved based on robust pre-clinical and clinical data for the common target(s) with masking of the rare target(s) not adequately supported by the data. Masking involves software programming that prevents the user from viewing results for specific targets, and allows the test to reach the market before adequate data on rare targets are available. Sponsors may continue to evaluate the rare targets postmarket to support unmasking. This process thus allows collection of additional clinical data to support the final approval of the device for all targets.\n\nExample: When quadripolar lead connectors were introduced, FDA worked with sponsors to capture clinical data in both the premarket and postmarket settings in combination with premarket animal study data and bench testing.\n\nWhere the performance of a particular device type is well-studied, documented, and understood. It may be possible to approve a new device or a new indication for an existing device based on safety and effectiveness information already known about the device or device type.\n\nClinical data that may be sufficient in cases like this include Objective Performance Criteria (OPC), Performance Goals (PG), Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), or other data in lieu of a randomized controlled clinical trial.\n\nExample: A sponsor is seeking approval of a 7-day extended wear lens. The same lens was approved for daily wear and the sponsor has a substantial marketing history in the U.S. for the daily wear lens. If the 7-day lens is made of the same material as the daily wear lens, FDA may consider transferring a clinical study to assess most aspects of device safety to the postmarket setting.\n\nWhere long-term outside the U.S. (OUS) clinical performance data is available but not sufficient. It may be possible to defer to postmarket or otherwise limit the collection of clinical data from patients in the U.S. followed by a post-approval study if data from outside the U.S. is available and provides reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFDA's Expedited Access for Devices Guidance20 also describes circumstances under which FDA may consider it acceptable to collect certain data in the postmarket setting, rather than premarket, while still ensuring that the statutory standard for premarket approval of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness is met. As part of the Expedited Access Pathway program described in the Expedited Access for Devices Guidance, in order to facilitate earlier patient access to devices that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need, FDA may accept a higher degree of uncertainty about the benefit-risk profile of the device at the time of approval by collecting certain data in the postmarket setting rather than premarket. Please reference the Expedited Access Pathway guidance for more information about how FDA may be willing to accept greater uncertainty.\n\nFDA believes it is important to routinely reassess whether data that the Agency receives in a premarket submission for a device type may instead be collected postmarket or if the data are no longer necessary for FDA to determine that there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device type. Sponsors who believe that the extent of data FDA previously expected in a premarket submission for the device type for which they plan to submit a PMA should be collected postmarket or should no longer be required, should submit a Pre-Submission (\"Pre-Sub\"),21 as described in FDA's guidance, \"Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff\"22 (\"Pre-Sub Guidance\").23\n\nFootnote 21: Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, added by section 1136 of FDASIA, requires applicants to include an electronic copy of certain submission types, including PMA submissions and Pre-Subs, after issuance of final guidance implementing that provision. FDA issued the guidance eCopy Program for Medical Devices Submissions (available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM313794.pdf), on December 31, 2012. Sponsors are therefore required to include an eCopy for all PMA submission types and Pre-Subs.\n\nFootnote 22: For more information on the Pre-Sub Program, see FDA\u2019s guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf). FDA\u2019s draft guidance represents FDA\u2019s proposed approach on this topic.\n\nFootnote 23: As another option, for devices that have been automatically classified into class III under Section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, if there is an approved PMA for a device of that type, sponsors may seek reclassification under Section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act. If there is no approved PMA for a device of that type, a de novo request may be an appropriate option for such a device.\n\nV Conditions of Approval\n--------------------\nContext title: Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices Subject to Premarket Approval Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.39026525616645813", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n\nStatistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests\n\nDocument issued on: March 13, 2007\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on March 12, 2003.\n\nFor questions regarding this document, contact Kristen Meier at 240-276-3060, or send an e-mail to kristen.meier@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nDiagnostic Devices Branch\n\nDivision of Biostatistics\n\nOffice of Surveillance and Biometrics\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nWritten comments and suggestions may be submitted at any time for Agency consideration to the Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, (HFA-305), Rockville, MD, 20852.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Background\n\nThis guidance is intended to describe some statistically appropriate practices for reporting results from different studies evaluating diagnostic tests and identify some common inappropriate practices. The recommendations in this guidance pertain to diagnostic tests where the final result is qualitative (even if the underlying measurement is quantitative). We focus special attention on the practice called discrepant resolution and its associated problems.\n\nOn February 11, 1998, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health convened a joint meeting of the Microbiology, Hematology/Pathology, Clinical Chemistry/Toxicology, and Immunology Devices Panels. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain recommendations on \"appropriate data collection, analysis, and resolution of discrepant results, using sound scientific and statistical analysis to support indications for use of the in vitro diagnostic devices when the new device is compared to another device, a recognized reference method or 'gold standard,' or other procedures not commonly used, and/or clinical criteria for diagnosis.\" Using the input from that meeting, a draft guidance document was developed discussing some statistically valid approaches to reporting results from evaluation studies for new diagnostic devices. The draft guidance was released for public comment March 12, 2003.\n\nFollowing publication of the draft guidance, FDA received 11 comments. Overall, the comments were favorable and requested additional information be included in the final guidance. Some respondents requested greater attention to the use of standard terminology.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCorrect use of terminology for describing performance results is important to ensure safe and effective use of a diagnostic device. Whenever possible, this guidance uses internationally accepted terminology and definitions as compiled in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Harmonized Terminology Database.1 This guidance also uses terms as they are defined in the STARD (_STA_ndards for _R_eporting of _D_iagnostic Accuracy) Initiative.2 The STARD Initiative pertains to studies of diagnostic accuracy. While the STARD Initiative does not specifically address studies designed to demonstrate diagnostic device equivalence, many of the reporting concepts are still applicable.\n\nFootnote 1: This database is publicly available at www.clsi.org.\n\nFootnote 2: See www.consort-statement.org/stardstatement.htm or two articles by Bossuyt et al. 2003a,b.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nWe believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways to contact him, can be found on the Internet at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.\n\n3. Scope\n\nThis document provides guidance for the submission of premarket notification (510(k)) and premarket approval (PMA) applications for diagnostic devices (tests). This guidance addresses the reporting of results from different types of studies evaluating diagnostic devices with two possible outcomes (positive or negative) in PMAs and 510(k)s. The guidance is intended for both statisticians and non-statisticians.\n\nThis guidance does not address the fundamental statistical issues associated with design and monitoring of clinical studies for diagnostic devices.\n\n4. Introduction\n\nThis section provides an explanation of the concepts relevant to this guidance. We note at the outset that evaluation of a new diagnostic test should compare a new product'soutcome (test results) to an appropriate and relevant diagnostic benchmark using subjects/patients from the intended use population; that is, those subjects/patients for whom the test is intended to be used. In STARD, this is called the target population.\n\nOther important concepts and definitions include the following:\n\nTypes of test results\n\nThe method of comparison depends on the nature of the test results. Diagnostic test results (outcomes) are usually classified as either quantitative or qualitative. A quantitative result is a numerical amount or level, while a qualitative result usually consists of one of only two possible responses; for example, diseased or non-diseased, positive or negative, yes or no. This document pertains to diagnostic tests where the final result is qualitative (even if the underlying measurement is quantitative). Quantitative tests and tests with ordinal outcomes (more than two possible outcomes, but ordered) are not discussed here.\n\nWe also assume throughout that your study data do not include multiple samples from single patients.\n\nPurpose of a qualitative diagnostic test\n\nA qualitative diagnostic test (test) is designed to determine whether a target condition is present or absent in a subject from the intended use population. As defined in STARD, the target condition (condition of interest) \"can refer to a particular disease, a disease stage, health status, or any other identifiable condition within a patient, such as staging a disease already known to be present, or a health condition that should prompt clinical action, such as the initiation, modification or termination of treatment.\"\n\nFDA recommends your labeling characterize diagnostic test performance for use by all intended users (laboratories, health care providers, and/or home users).\n\nBenchmarks\n\nFDA recognizes two major categories of benchmarks for assessing diagnostic performance of new qualitative diagnostic tests. These categories are (1) comparison to a reference standard (defined below), or (2) comparison to a method or predicate other than a reference standard (non-reference standard). The choice of comparative method will determine which performance measures may be reported in the label.\n\nDiagnostic accuracy and the reference standard\n\nThe diagnostic accuracy of a new test refers to the extent of agreement between the outcome of the new test and the reference standard. We use the term reference standard as defined in STARD. That is, a reference standard is \"considered to be the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target condition.\" It divides the intended use population into only two groups (condition present or absent) and does not consider the outcome of the new test under evaluation.\n--------------------\nContext title: Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests - Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.0079782009124756", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Point Of Care (POC) Assays\n\nBefore preparing to use the migration studies approach for a POC assay, you should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the definitions in this guidance. The migration studies should be conducted in the hands of intended users of the POC assays. You should contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division to obtain recommendations about migration studies for a POC device.\n\nVII Other Studies\n\nDepending upon the unique characteristics of the qualitative, quantitative or semi-quantitative assay being migrated to the new system, the following studies may be called for. If not previously conducted for the old system, they should be performed for the new system.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you determine that a study described below is not applicable for your system, you should describe your reasoning in detail in your application to FDA. FDA will consider such explanations on a case-by-case basis particularly for manual to semi-automated or automated system migrations.\n\nCarry-over or cross-contamination studies: The importance of repeating these studies on a new system can be ascertained by a thorough analysis of the new system. As mentioned in Section V of this document, block diagrams and side-by-side comparison tables would be beneficial in this determination. Changes to specific physical features such as a change in sample pipettor design or the layout of the new system could indicate the need for new carry-over studies. If a carry-over study for the new system is appropriate and the new design is sufficiently similar to the old system, the new study can be the same as previously used for the old system. Samples with high positive concentrations of analyte should be tested alternating with analyte-negative samples in patterns dependent on the operational function of the instrument. The concentration of analyte in the high positive samples should exceed 95%-99% or more of the results normally obtained in clinical samples from diseased patients in the intended use population. This testing should be done over multiple runs (at least 5 runs are recommended by the Commission of European Communities10). Footnote 10: Commission Decision 2002/364/EC of 7 May 2002 on common technical specifications for in vitro-diagnostic medical devices [Official Journal L 131 of 16.05.2002].\n\nMatrix equivalency and recovery studies: Presumptively, because there are no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to different matrices unless physical alterations of the new system could create such an effect. Similarly, recovery studies should not be affected by the migration of an assay from an old to a new system.\n\nInterfering substances studies: Presumptively, with no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to interfering substances.\n\nOn-board reagent/calibrator and sample stability studies: Unless there are physical or process changes to the new system, presumptively, there should be no effect on assay performance due to on-board reagent or sample stability.\n\nCross-reactivity studies: Presumptively, as there are no changes in assay components, a migration to a new system should have no effect on the existing cross-reactivity.\n\nHook effect studies: Presumptively, because there is no assay change, the parameters of the hook effect should be the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create such an effect.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVerification of kit control material and calibrators: Presumptively because there is no change to the assay, the control results and calibration ranges should remain the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create new effects.\n\nIf new analyte-specific information requires new studies to bring the assay's performance characteristics up-to-date, please contact FDA for guidance.\n\nVIII. Molecular Assays\n\nThere are specific criteria that are unique to nucleic acid tests (NAT) and therefore NATs present additional specific concerns over serological and antigen assays:\n\nWhen appropriate, you should provide testing with panels showing a rise in viral titer over time from serial bleeds (viremic profile). Similar to seroconversion panels, they should have a minimum number of days between bleeds and begin with at least one negative bleed. They should be of clinical relevance to the appropriate individual marker.\n\nCarryover studies: Because of the increased risks of carryover due to the amplification methodologies utilized in molecular testing (e.g., PCR, TMA), you should perform carryover studies for all NAT migration studies.\n\nSample stability: Because of the nature of DNA and especially RNA, careful attention should be given to the stability of samples in relation to on-board storage and manipulation.\n\nSample processing: The processes of purification and extraction of DNA or RNA from clinical samples is critical to the success of molecular tests. You should evaluate any additions or modifications associated with the new system that could affect these processes.\n\nValidation of control material and calibrators: You should perform these studies on the new system due to the sensitive nature of molecular assays.\n\nFor molecular assays detecting multiple analytes, please contact FDA for further discussion.\n\nIX. Regulatory Outcomes\n\nShould the acceptance criteria noted in Sections VI.A.4 or VI.B.4 above be met, it would be appropriate for the sponsor to claim that the new system does not compromise the results as compared to the old system. It would not be appropriate to claim improved performance characteristics. It would also not be appropriate to compute clinical performance claims for the new system based on the migrationstudies described here, since these studies are analytical, rather than clinical. Should you wish to develop more extensive claims, the migration studies paradigm would not be an appropriate scientific approach.\n\nIf the acceptance criteria are not met and the aberrant performance could affect clinical management, you will be asked to perform a complete clinical study presenting the clinical performance of the assay on the new system.\n\nX Glossary\n\nFor the purposes of this document the following definitions are used. HTD referenced terms are based on the CLSI Harmonized Terminology Database.\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% negative (or 5% positive) (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% positive (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 50 % positive (or 50% negative). Under ideal circumstances, C({}_{50}) will exactly equal the cutoff established by the manufacturer.\n\nCalibrators: a substance or device that is based on a reference preparation or in which the analyte concentration or other quantity has been determined by an analytical procedure of stated reliability. Calibrators are used to calibrate, graduate, or adjust a measurement [HTD].\n\nCarry-over: amount of analyte carried by the measuring system from one sample reaction into subsequent sample reactions, thereby erroneously affecting the apparent amounts in subsequent samples [HTD].\n\nControl material: a device, solution, or preparation intended for use in the quality control process to monitor the reliability of a test system and to evaluate its performance within established limits.\n\nCross-reactivity: the ability of a drug, metabolite, a structurally similar compound other than the primary analyte, or even unrelated compound to affect the assay [HTD].\n\nCutoff value (CO): for a qualitative test, the threshold above which the result of the test is reported as positive and below which the result is reported as negative.\n\nHigh negative sample (C({}_{\\$})): a sample with a concentration of analyte close to the C({}_{\\$}) as determined by the old system. This term is equivalent to a \"weak negative sample\" for example as used in the guidance document \"Recommendations for CLIA Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of IVDs\",\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm070890.pdf.\n\nHook effect (high dose hook effect): effect of a suboptimal antigen-antibody reaction in which either the antibody or antigen is in excess resulting in an incomplete, or blocked reaction leading to a decreasing signal response at very high levels of analyte. It is used interchangeably with \"prozone effect,\" [HTD].\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInterfering substances: endogenous (e.g., blood components, acidic polysaccharides) or exogenous (e.g., talc, anticoagulant) substances in clinical samples that can cause false-positive or false-negative results in a test system [HTD].\n\nLimit of blank (LoB): highest measurement result that is likely to be observed (with a stated probability) for a blank sample (a sample with concentration at or near zero) (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD]).\n\nLimit of detection (LoD): the lowest concentration of analyte that can be reported to be present at a specified level of confidence, although perhaps not quantified to an exact value. Similarly, an amount of analyte in a sample for which the probability of falsely claiming the absence is (\\beta) (type II error) given a probability (\\alpha) (type I error) of falsely claiming its presence (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD])\n\nLimit of quantitation (LoQ): the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be quantitatively determined with {stated} acceptable precision and {stated, acceptable} accuracy, under stated experimental conditions (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD]).\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.670830726623535", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Highly Multiplexed Microbiological/Medical Countermeasure In Vitro Nucleic Acid Based Diagnostic Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on August 27, 2014.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on November 9, 2012.\n\nFor questions about this document, contact the Division of Microbiology Devices at 301-796-5461 and John Hobson at 301-796-5892 or John.Hobson@fda.hhs.gov.\n\n**U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health Division of Microbiology Devices\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\n2 BACKGROUND\n\n3 SCOPE\n\n4 RISKS TO HEALTH\n\n5 DEVICE DESCRIPTION\n\n3 A.

For the assays addressed by this guidance, positive results do not rule out potential co-infection with other pathogens, and negative results should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or patient management decisions.\n\nThis guidance provides detailed information on the types of data FDA recommends submitting in support of Class II premarket devices. The inclusion of certain analytes could elevate the classification of the device to Class III, and we encourage sponsors to contact the FDA for additional guidance.1 In addition, if you plan to seek clearance or approval for a microbiology multiplexed device that detects less than 20 organisms/targets, please contact the Agency prior to undertaking any clinical or analytical validation studies to discuss whether the recommendations found within this guidance may be applicable.\n\nFootnote 1: Certain analytes are inherently high risk, including some that are insufficiently understood to authoritatively identify the risks, and therefore belong in class III. A device that tests multiple analytes takes on the classification of the highest class analyte.\n\n4 Risks to Health\n\nThe potential risks to health associated with HMMDs that are used in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and other laboratory tests to aid in the diagnosis of infection include: failure of the device to perform as indicated, leading to inaccurate results or lack of results, and incorrect interpretation of results. These potential risks may lead to incorrect patient management decisions.\n\nA false positive result could lead to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment for the misidentified illness, as well as delayed treatment of the actual infection, which may potentially lead to a more serious infection. Additionally, a false positive result in the context of a public health emergency could lead to misallocation of resources used for surveillance and prevention. A false negative result, or lack of result, could lead to failure to provide a diagnosis and the correct treatment, may contribute to unnecessary treatment, or incorrect patient management to prevent transmission of infection.\n\n5 Device Description\n\nIn your 510(k) submission, you should identify the regulation, the product code(s), and a legally marketed predicate device(s). We recommend you include a table that outlines the similarities and differences between the predicate or multiple predicates and your device. You should include the following descriptive information to adequately characterize your highly multiplexed microbiological/medical countermeasure device.\n\nIntended Use\n\nThe intended use should specify the pathogens and, if applicable, drug resistance markers that the test detects and identifies, the nature of the analyte (e.g., RNA, DNA, or both RNA and DNA), specimen types for which testing will be indicated, the clinical indications for which the test is to be used, and the specific population(s) for which the test is intended. The intended use should state that the test is qualitative or quantitative, whether detection of an analyte is presumptive, and any specific conditions of use.\n\nIn your 510(k), you should clearly include the following information related to the intended use of your product:\n\nThe identity, phylogenetic relationship, or other recognized characterization of the pathogens that your device is designed to detect.\n\nHow the device results might be used in a diagnostic algorithm if applicable. Additional measures that might be needed for a laboratory identification and diagnosis of the infection.\n\nAdditional measures that should be instituted if infection with a novel or emerging pathogen is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria.\n\n2 Test Methodology\n\nYou should describe, in detail, the methodology used by your device. You should describe the following elements, at a minimum, as applicable to your device:\n\nTest platform (e.g., multiplexed RT-PCR, bead arrays, re-sequencing array, mass spectrometry used in conjunction with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)).\n\nInformation and rationale for selection of specific target sequences and the methods used to design detection elements.\n\nSpecim collection (e.g., swabs, viral culture media, positive blood culture, etc.) and handling methods.\n\nSpecim matrix (e.g., blood, sputum, stool, etc.).\n\nAll pre-analytical methods and instrumentation for collection, stabilization, and concentration of specimens.\n\nSpecificity of the pathogen sequences being detected (i.e., methodologies used in addition to the evaluation of clinical specificity to demonstrate the target sequence is found only in the pathogen of interest).\n\nLimiting factors of the assay (e.g., saturation level, maximum cycle number, etc.).\n\nReagent components provided or recommended for use, and their function within the system (e.g., buffers, enzymes, fluorescent dyes, chemiluminescent reagents, oligonucleotides, other signaling/amplification reagents, etc).\n\nThe potential for specific and non-specific interference effects from reagents or device material.\n\nInternal controls and a description of their specific function in the system.\n\nExternal controls that you recommend or provide to users.\n\nInstrumentation inherent to using your device, including the components and their function within the system.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe signal analysis and interpretation from raw data to the reported result (e.g., how raw signals are processed and converted into a useable result). This would include sufficient software controls for identifying and dealing with obvious problems in the dataset. It would also include adjustment for background and normalization, if applicable.\n* Illustrations, photographs, and a detailed description of non-standard equipment or methods, if available.\n* Design inputs and outputs with a risk analysis and traceability matrix.\n\nWhen applicable, you should include descriptions of how your device's features address or mitigates risks associated with highly multiplexed devices such as the following examples:\n\nPrevention of cross-contamination for multiplexed tests in which many probes are included in the device.\n\nCorrect placement and identity of assay features (e.g., probes, arrayed capture oligos).\n\nMinimization of false positive results due to contamination or carryover of specimen.\n\nHow to enable detection of emerging variants due to mutations within the target organism.\n\nProcess controls used to detect and/or correct long term drift in device performance due to antigenic drift.\n\nAppendix C Ancillary Reagents\n\nAncillary reagents are those reagents that a manufacturer of HMMDs specifies in device labeling as \"required but not provided\" in order to carry out the assay as indicated in its instructions for use and to achieve the test performance claimed in labeling for the assay. For the purposes of this document, specific ancillary reagents are those that you specify with a catalog or product number, or other specific designation as necessary for your device to achieve its labeled performance characteristics. For example, if your device labeling specifies the use of a specific brand of reagent (e.g., 'Brand X or other amplification enzyme that has been shown to be equivalent') and the use of any other DNA amplification enzyme may alter the performance characteristics of your device from that reported in your labeling, then Brand X DNA amplification enzyme or other amplification enzymes shown to be equivalent to Brand X DNA amplification enzyme are ancillary reagents of concern for the purposes of this document.2\n\nFootnote 2: Even if you establish that one or more alternative ancillary reagents may be used in your assay, each of those named alternatives may still be an ancillary reagent. If you are unsure whether this aspect of the guidance applies to your device, we recommend you consult with the Division of Microbiology Devices in the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.\n\nBy contrast, if your device requires the use of 95% ethanol, and any type of 95% ethanol will allow your device to achieve the performance characteristics provided in your labeling, then 95% ethanol is not an ancillary reagent for the purposes of this document.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Highly Multiplexed Microbiological:Medical Countermeasure In Vitro Nucleic Acid Based Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.7989938259124756", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/assay-migration-studies-vitro-diagnostic-devices.\n\nOption 3: As an alternative to comparison study designs, for certain test systems, flex and human factors engineering studies may provide sufficient assurance that the change in user populations and environment of use between non-waived and waived settings will not adversely impact the results provided by the candidate test; i.e., that the likelihood of erroneous results by the users is negligible. Possible study design approaches that may be suitable include flex study designs described in section IV above and human factor study designs described in FDA's guidance \"Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineeringto Medical Devices.\"23 FDA believes this approach is generally appropriate for test systems for which:\n\nFootnote 23: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices.\n\ncollection of a specimen is either always performed by a professional (for example, an endocervical swab collected by a doctor) or always by a patient (for example, a urine specimen collected by the patient), and\n\nother pre-analytical steps are very simple (for example, placement of the entire specimen in the analyzer), and\n\nintended use patient populations are sufficiently similar.\n\nAdditionally, another scenario where this option may be appropriate is a CLIA waiver application for a modification of a previously waived test system where the Quick Reference Guide was not modified (or minimally modified). FDA encourages manufacturers considering modification of a test system previously waived by application to contact FDA through a Pre-Submission to discuss planned modifications, as well as study designs and analyses to validate that the modified test system meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver.24\n\nFootnote 24: A Pre-Submission is a type of Q-Submission. For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nOption 4: Comparison study designs in which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained operators. This option is also useful for Dual Submissions where a 510(k) and CLIA waiver are being sought concurrently.\n\nFor general recommendations on comparison study design and analysis for Options 1 and 4, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as:\n\nFor quantitative tests: CLSI EP21,25 CLSI EP27.26 Footnote 25: CLSI EP21 Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative tests: CLSI EP12.27 Footnote 26: CLSI EP27 How to Construct and Interpret an Error Grid for Quantitative Diagnostic Assays.\n\nFor Options 1, 2, and 4, if sufficient valid scientific evidence on the imprecision of the test and the performance of the test at low levels (limit of detection and limit of quantitation) when performed by untrained operators is not available from the studies described above, additional studies should be performed to allow comparison of the imprecision and limit of detection/limit of quantitation of the test when performed by untrained and trained operators. We recommend following appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g., CLSI EP05,28 CLSI EP12, CLSI EP1729) for these studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to submit a Pre-Submission to obtain feedback from FDA on planned study designs prior to conducting the study. FDA welcomes discussion of additional study design approaches besides the four options presented in this guidance.30\n\nFootnote 30: For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The O-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nAppendix B Considerations in Satisfying CLIA Waiver Requirements\n\nOne statutory criteria that a test can meet to obtain a CLIA waiver centers on the simplicity of the test and whether the user can conduct the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.31 All tests have some likelihood of erroneous results, but whether the likelihood of erroneous results in the hands of waived test users is negligible will vary from test to test depending on a number of factors. These factors include intended use, context of use (e.g., patient population, use environment), and the probable benefit(s) and probable risk(s)/harm(s) associated with waived use of the test. FDA intends for its approach to benefit-risk considerations to be consistent with the principles expressed, to the extent applicable, in FDA's other guidances.32 Accordingly, the appropriate acceptance criteria for the studies performed using the design options described above will vary from test to test. For example, for a qualitative test performed following study Options 1 or 2, the minimum level of agreement between results of the test in the hands of untrained and trained users for demonstrating comparable performance should generally be higher for a test for which erroneous results in waived settings are associated with a higher extent of probable patient risk/harm than for tests with lower probable risk/harm in waived settings.\n\nFootnote 31: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263a(d)(3)(A).\n\nFootnote 32: See, for example, \u201c_Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/benefit-risk-factors-consider-when-determining-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, and \u201c_Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/factors-consider-when-making-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approval-and-de.\n\nAppendix C General Study Design Considerations\n\nFor all study design options, FDA recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as closely as possible, actual CLIA-waived settings, patients, samples, and test operators. Therefore, study designs should include the following:\n\nTesting sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.\n\nSubject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).\n\nIntended sample type and matrix.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUntrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.\n\nTesting should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.\n\nTesting sites\n\nYou should conduct the study to support CLIA waiver at a minimum of three sites that are representative of both the intended use patient population and the intended operators in CLIA-waived settings. Generally, the sites should include different demographic and geographic locations (e.g., outpatient clinic, physician's office), since patient populations and intended operators typically vary among different demographic locations. In your CLIA waiver application, you should present a brief description of each site, including its name, address, and the date the study was performed. If there were sites that were included at the beginning, but then did not complete the study, you should provide a brief explanation for why those sites did not complete the study.\n\nFor study Options 1 and 2, trained operators may perform testing at the same sites as the untrained operators, or at a different laboratory site. For study Option 4, trained operators should perform testing with the comparative method at an appropriate laboratory site.\n\nOperators\n\nUntrained operators\n\nThe study should include 1-3 untrained operators at each site and at least nine (9) untrained operators across all sites. You should ensure that the untrained operator study participants enrolled represent anticipated operators of the device you propose for CLIA waiver. Untrained operators should have limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing and should not have previous training or experience with the candidate test, but may have limited experience with other waived or home use tests. Untrained operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties. We recommend that you record and tabulate the education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each untrained operator to demonstrate that these participants meet the definition of intended operators and include this in your CLIA waiver application. In addition, for each study site, we recommend you report the same information on other personnel that were available at the testing site but that were not chosen to participate.\n\nTrained operators\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.061655044555664"], "As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: #156\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nComparability Protocols -\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and\n\nControls Information\n\nfor New Animal Drugs\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.2033393383026123", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Equipment and system integration: Aspects of equipment design and system integration that are shown to be critical to output material quality and its control should be described and justified in the context of the overall control strategy.\n\nA summary of the control strategy should be provided in CTD section 3.2.S.2.6 or 3.2.P.2.3 with links or references to the CTD sections that contain the detailed information to enable the understanding and evaluation of the manufacturing process and how it is controlled.\n\nBatch Description and Batch Size\n\nThe approach to define batch size (see examples in Section 2.2) and the proposed commercial batch size or range should be described in the dossier.\n\nIf a range is proposed, it should be justified, and the approach for achieving the range should be described (see Section 2.2). Changes in batch size within the approved batch size range can be managed within the PQS. Any post-approval change beyond the approved range should be supported by data (Section 3.2) and appropriately managed (i.e., prior approval or notification).\n\nA suitable quantitative metric with acceptance criteria should be defined within the PQS to establish batch-to-batch consistency and system robustness. For example, when a batch size is defined by the amount of collected material, the amount of diverted materials relative to that of collected materials for each batch should be considered.\n\nThe actual intended size of a given batch should be defined before manufacturing begins.\n\nProcess Models\n\nThe level of detail provided in the dossier regarding model development, validation, and maintenance over the lifecycle should be commensurate with the model type and impact category. The process model should be specific for the defined system (e.g., equipment, layout, connections). Information to support models used as part of commercial manufacturing should be available during site inspection and maintained at or be accessible to the manufacturing site. Refer to Points to Consider: ICH-Endorsed Guide for ICH Q8/Q9/Q10 Implementation for regulatory expectations on process models.\n\nDrug Substance and Drug Product Stability\n\nRegulatory expectations for the stability data package generally do not differ between CM and batch manufacturing modes (refer to ICH Q1A, ICH Q5C). Batches used to generate primary stability data should be manufactured using a manufacturing process and equipment representative of the commercial process. Primary stability batches should incorporate the variability described in the ICH stability guidelines (e.g., different drug substance batches).\n\nAdditionally, for chemical drug substances or drug products:\n\nStability batches could be obtained with a single start-up/shutdown sequence provided the aforementioned variability is incorporated into the batches (e.g., by introducing different batches of drug substances in a sequential manner).\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.358945369720459", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Methods validation includes an assessment of the suitability of the analytical procedure. A validation plan would have prespecified acceptance criteria for relevant validation parameters such as precision, range, accuracy, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit. The proposed acceptance criteria for these parameters would ensure that the analytical procedure is appropriate for its intended use. The validation plan would assess whether a revised procedure is more susceptible than the original procedure to matrix effects by process buffers/media, product-related contaminants, or other components present in the dosage form. A plan would identify any statistical analyses that will be performed and whether product testing to compare the two procedures is intended. The need and plan for providing product testing to compare the two procedures could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and type of test (e.g., chemical, biological).\n\nWhen used for release or process control, use of the new revised analytical procedure should not result in deletion of a test or relaxation of acceptance criteria that are described in the approved application.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Manufacturing Equipment That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nComparability protocols may be most useful if applicants are planning to change to equipment with a different operating principal. Equipment changes are often made in conjunction with changes to the manufacturing process. We recommend that you evaluate this type of change with respect to its effect on the production process prior to deciding whether or not a comparability protocol would be appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changing Manufacturing Facilities That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nThe utility of a comparability protocol is often limited due to the scope of the change and the need, in some cases, for an inspection. For example, a move to a new facility can involve many changes (e.g., new equipment, modified manufacturing process) that are difficult to prospectively identify as part of a comparability protocol because the new facility is unknown or not constructed at the time the comparability protocol is being considered. We recommend you consider carefully the appropriateness of a comparability protocol for a facility change that involves many other changes.\n\nWe recommend a statement be included in the comparability protocol for changing manufacturing facilities saying that a move to a different drug substance or drug product manufacturing site will be implemented only when the site has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation. Furthermore, in the case of aseptically processed product, the statement would also indicate that a move to a different facility or area (e.g., room or building on a campus) will be made only when the specific facility or area has a satisfactory CGMP inspection (irrespective of the overall CGMP status for the campus). For a move to another type of site (e.g., drug substance intermediate manufacturing site, testing laboratory), a statement would be included that the move to this site would not be implemented if there were an unsatisfactory CGMP inspection for the site.9\n\nFootnote 9: A satisfactory CGMP inspection is an FDA inspection during which (1) no objectionable conditions or practices were found (No Action Indicated (NAI)) or (2) objectionable conditions were found, but corrective action is left to the firm to take voluntarily and the objectionable conditions will not be the subject of further administrative or regulatory actions (Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI)).\n\nCan a Comparability Protocol Be Used for Container Closure System Changes?\n\nIn the past, applicants have used protocols for container closure system changes, and they can continue to use them. A comparability protocol can be particularly useful for repetitive container closure system changes.\n\nG. Can Implementation of or Changes in Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nFDA anticipates that implementation of or changes in PAT could be addressed in a comparability protocol. Early dialogue with FDA is encouraged.10\n\nFootnote 10: See GFI titled \u201cPAT \u2013 A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance\u201d at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070305.pdf.\n\nCan a VMF Be Cross-Referenced in an Applicant's Comparability Protocol?\n\nA master file can be cross-referenced in a comparability protocol that provides for CMC changes (e.g., new manufacturer of drug substance, container resin). The protocol would include a commitment to provide a letter authorizing the FDA to review the master file when a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA. The comparability protocol would also indicate the type of information (e.g., manufacturing and formulation information for a plastic resin) that will be referenced in the master file and the information that you will provide such as the studies you will perform to demonstrate the suitability of the new material (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, stability studies).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nI. Can a Comparability Protocol Be Included in a VMF?\n\nA comparability protocol can be included in a master file. The protocol can be cross-referenced for CMC changes. Comparability protocols are product specific. Therefore, the applicant's submission would provide a comparability protocol that augments the information provided in the master file by specifying, for example, any additional studies that will be performed to demonstrate suitability of the postchange material (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, and stability studies). The FDA ordinarily neither independently reviews master files nor approves or disapproves submissions to a master file.\n\nJ. Can a Comparability Protocol be Included in a (J)INAD?\n\nComparability protocols may be submitted in a chemistry, manufacturing and controls (J)INAD technical data submission11 or a (J)INAD protocol without substantial data.12\n\nFootnote 11: Technical data submissions are described in GFI #132 - Administrative Applications and the Phased Review Process at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM052\n\n532.pdf\n\nFootnote 12: According to the performance goals and procedures for the ADUFA and AGDUFA reauthorizations for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, comparability protocols as described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v) may be submitted as comparability protocols without substantial data in a (J)INAD file. For more complex comparability protocols, for example sterile process validation protocols, the sponsor should discuss and have Agency concurrence regarding the appropriate filing strategy. See\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalDrugUserFeActADUFA/UCM343226.pdf and\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalGenericDrugUserFeActAGDUFA/UCM343235.pdf\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.780130863189697", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: A comparability protocol should include a plan for the stability studies that will be performed to demonstrate the equivalence of pre- and postchange product. The comparability protocol would provide (1) information that is typically provided in a stability protocol, such as the number and type of batches that will be studied, test conditions, and test time points or (2) a reference to the currently approved stability protocol. The amount of stability data that will be generated before the product made with the change is distributed would be specified. The plan for evaluating stability could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and available manufacturing information. In some cases, no stability studies may be warranted or a commitment to report results from stability studies in an AR can be sufficient. If no stability studies are planned, we recommend that this be stated clearly.\n\nThe differences, if any, in the tests and studies from those previously reported in the approved application or subsequent updates (i.e., supplements, annual reports) would be described. We recommend you identify the location in your application of any referenced tests or studies.\n\niv.2.3 Analytical Procedures to be Used\n\nA protocol should specify the analytical procedures that you intend to use to assess the effect of the CMC changes on the product or intermediate material. Analytical procedures would be chosen capable of detecting new impurities or other changes in a product that can result from the change.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]\n\nmade under the comparability protocol, the specification can be updated and provided when a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA.\n\niv.2.5 Data to Be Reported Under or Included With the Comparability Protocol\n\nYou should identify the type (e.g., release, long-term or accelerated stability data) and amount of data (e.g., 3-months accelerated stability data) that will be submitted at the time a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA and, when appropriate, generated prior to your distributing the product made with the change (e.g., when proposed reporting category is a CBE-30, CBE-0, or AR).\n\nIf available, you can include any data from studies performed to assess the feasibility of the proposed change with the proposed comparability protocol. Data obtained from a small-scale process or other studies incorporating the proposed change can provide preliminary evidence that the change is feasible, as well as preliminary information on the effect of the change on the product. Development or feasibility studies can provide insight into the relevance and adequacy of the choice of the battery of tests you have identified to assess the product.\n\niv.2.6 Proposed Reporting Category\n\nThe use of an approved comparability protocol may justify a reduction in the reporting category for the particular CMC change when implemented (see III.A). We recommend you include a proposal for the reporting category that you would use for changes implemented using the approved comparability protocol. FDA will evaluate your proposed reporting category as part of its review of the comparability protocol and communicate any concerns about your proposal. Agreement by the applicant and FDA on the reporting category for the specified CMC changes will be part of the process of approving the comparability protocol.\n\niv.2.7 Equivalence Not Demonstrated Using the Approved Comparability Protocol\n\nIt is anticipated that some changes in the manufacturing process will result in a postchange product that cannot be demonstrated to be equivalent to the prechange product without more extensive physicochemical, biological, pharmacology, PK/PD, efficacy, or safety testing or in a product that does not meet the prespecified acceptance criteria in the protocol. You should identify in the protocol the steps you will take in such circumstances.\n\niv.2.8 Commitment\n\nYou should include a commitment in your comparability protocol that you will update or withdraw your protocol when it becomes obsolete (see section IV.D.)Does FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in the Manufacturing Process That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?*\n\nIn addition to the general considerations provided in section V.A, we recommend that you consider the following issues for changes in the manufacturing process, where applicable:\n\nv.2.1 Comparison of Physical Characteristics\n\nA comparability protocol would normally include a plan to compare the physical characteristics (e.g., polymorph forms, particle size distribution) of the product produced using the old and new processes when these characteristics are relevant to the safety and/or efficacy of the product.\n\nv.2.2 Comparison of Impurity Profiles\n\nA comparability protocol would include a plan to determine the impurity profile of the product produced using the new process. The studies would assess product-related impurities and process-related impurities, including, if applicable in-process reagents and catalysts. We recommend that attention be given to demonstrating the absence of any new impurities or contaminants, or that they are removed or inactivated by downstream processing. Any changes in the impurity profile would meet the predefined criteria (see section V.A.4). The predefined criteria would indicate when qualification studies will be warranted to evaluate an increased level of an existing impurity or a new impurity (or an applicant could reference a relevant FDA guidance that recommends qualification levels).\n\nIf during implementation of a change under an approved comparability protocol, the data indicate that nonclinical or clinical qualification studies for impurities are warranted, the change would not be appropriate for implementation under the approved comparability protocol (see III.C and V.A.7)\n\nv.2.3 Effect on Downstream Processes\n\nWe recommend that the effect of the change on downstream processes be examined. Downstream processes such as purification steps can be affected by higher product yields or shifts in impurity profiles when upstream processes are modified. For example, adventitious agent removal or inactivation may have to be reassessed for processes involving materials or reagents derived from a biological source. A comparability protocol would discuss how to ensure that the entire manufacturing process is adequately controlled.\n\nv.2.4 Effect on Process Controls and Controls of Intermediates and/or In-process Materials\n\nWe recommend you identify and justify implementation of new controls or variations from approved controls. We recommend a statement be included that controls, including those that have been validated to inactivate and remove impurities or contaminants, will be revalidated for the new production process, if appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Analytical Procedures That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nA comparability protocol for changing an analytical procedure would provide the plan for validation of the changed analytical procedure and indicate whether the protocol will be used to modify the existing analytical procedure (i.e., retaining the same principle), or to change from one analytical procedure to another (e.g., normal to reverse phase HPLC). The comparability protocol would be designed to demonstrate that the proposed changes in the analytical procedures improve or do not significantly change characteristics used in methods validation that are relevant to the type of analytical procedure (e.g., accuracy, precision, specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, range).8\n\nFootnote 8: Guidance on validation of analytical procedures can be found in the CVM/VICH guidances GFI #63/GL1 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Definition and Terminology and GFI #64/GL2 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology.\n\nMethods validation includes an assessment of the suitability of the analytical procedure. A validation plan would have prespecified acceptance criteria for relevant validation parameters such as precision, range, accuracy, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit. The proposed acceptance criteria for these parameters would ensure that the analytical procedure is appropriate for its intended use. The validation plan would assess whether a revised procedure is more susceptible than the original procedure to matrix effects by process buffers/media, product-related contaminants, or other components present in the dosage form. A plan would identify any statistical analyses that will be performed and whether product testing to compare the two procedures is intended. The need and plan for providing product testing to compare the two procedures could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and type of test (e.g., chemical, biological).\n\nWhen used for release or process control, use of the new revised analytical procedure should not result in deletion of a test or relaxation of acceptance criteria that are described in the approved application.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Manufacturing Equipment That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nComparability protocols may be most useful if applicants are planning to change to equipment with a different operating principal. Equipment changes are often made in conjunction with changes to the manufacturing process. We recommend that you evaluate this type of change with respect to its effect on the production process prior to deciding whether or not a comparability protocol would be appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changing Manufacturing Facilities That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.067084312438965", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nComparability Protocols\n\nfor Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4th Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo()fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: ocod()fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information-biologics/biologics-guidances\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOctober 2022\n\nPharmaceutical Quality/CMC\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations or issues for industry to consider regarding a CP for manufacturing process changes that may affect the structure of the drug substance?

With the exception of the discussion in section V regarding submission of certain modifications to an approved comparability protocol in a changes being effected supplement or annual report,2 it does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nFootnote 2: This limited portion of the guidance has a binding effect on the FDA and holders of approved NDAs, ANDAs, and BLAs, pursuant to section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as implemented in 21 CFR 314.70 for NDAs and 601.12 for BLAs. For ANDAs, 21 CFR 314.70 is referenced in 314.97.\n\nFootnote 3: \u201cComparability protocol\u201d in this guidance is synonymous with \u201cpostapproval change management protocol (PACMP)\u201d in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q12 Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management and its Annexes (May 2021) (ICH 012).\n\nFootnote 4: For the purposes of this guidance, unless otherwise specified, references to \u201cdrugs\u201d \u201cdrug products\u201d, and \u201cproducts\u201d include drugs approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) and biological products licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262). Also, see definitions of \u201cdrug product\u201d and \u201cbiological product\u201d in 21 CFR 314.3 and 600.3, respectively.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis final guidance is intended to assist original applicants and holders of approved new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and biologics license applications (BLAs) with implementing a chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) postapproval change through the use of a comparability protocol (CP).3 A CP is a comprehensive, prospectively written plan for assessing the effect of a proposed postapproval CMC change(s) on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a drug product, including a biological product (i.e., product),4 as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product (i.e., product quality).5,6\n\nFootnote 5: In this guidance, \u201cproduct quality\u201d refers to the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a product, as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nFootnote 6: See also section 506A(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 356a(b)) and the definitions for \u201cassess the effects of the change\u201d in 21 CFR 314.3 and 600.3.\n\nSubmission of a CP in an original application or in a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an approved application allows FDA to review a description of one or more proposed CMCpostapproval changes, any supporting information and analysis, including a risk assessment, a plan to implement the change(s), and, if appropriate, a proposed reduced reporting category for the change(s). Approval of the original application or a subsequent PAS containing the CP provides an agreed-upon plan to implement the specified change(s), and in many cases, a justification to report the change(s) in a reduced reporting category, contingent upon your analysis of the data from the implementation of the change(s). In many cases, submission and approval of a CP will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution or facilitating a proactive approach to reinforcing the supply of the product sooner than if a CP were not used. The drivers for such changes include business needs, expanding markets, process improvements, potential for drug shortage, and accelerated manufacturing development that sometimes occurs with drugs eligible for expedited programs.7\n\nFootnote 7: See FDA guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions \u2013 Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).

However, this guidance is not applicable to blood and blood components; biological products that also meet the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act); or human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR part 1271. Recommendations for the use of CPs by manufacturers of licensed blood and blood components are included in a separate FDA guidance for industry on Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products: Human Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion or for Further Manufacture (December 2014). The scope of this guidance does not include animal drugs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.1208882331848145", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Demonstration of state of control with the modified/changed manufacturing process might include, but is not limited to, such items as:\n\nEstablishment of modified specifications for raw, source and starting materials, and reagents;\n\nAppropriate bioburden and/or viral safety testing of the postchange cell banks and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age for production;\n\nAdventitious agent clearance;\n\nRemoval of product- or process-related impurities, such as residual host cell DNA and proteins; and\n\nMaintenance of the purity level.\n\nFor approved products, an appropriate number of postchange batches should be analyzed to demonstrate consistent performance of the process.\n\nTo support the analysis of the changes and the control strategy, the manufacturer should prepare a description of the change that summarizes the prechange and the postchange manufacturing process and that clearly highlights modifications of the process and changes in controls in a side-by-side format.\n\nDemonstration of Comparability During Development (2.4)\n\nDuring product development, it is expected that multiple changes in the manufacturing process will occur that could impact drug product quality, safety, and efficacy. Comparability exercises are generally performed to demonstrate that nonclinical and clinical data generated with prechange product are applicable to postchange product in order to facilitate further development and, ultimately, to support the marketing authorization. Comparability studies conducted for products in development are influenced by factors such as the stage of product development, the availability of validated analytical procedures, and the extent of product and process knowledge, which are limited at times due to the available experience that the manufacturer has with the process.\n\nWhere changes are introduced in development before nonclinical studies, the issue of assessing comparability is not generally raised because the manufacturer subsequently conducts\n\nnonclinical and clinical studies using the postchange product as part of the development process. During early phases of nonclinical and clinical studies, comparability testing is generally not as extensive as for an approved product. As knowledge and information accumulate, and the analytical tools develop, the comparability exercise should utilize available information and will generally become more comprehensive. Where process changes are introduced in late stages of development and no additional clinical studies are planned to support the marketing\n\nauthorization, the comparability exercise should be as comprehensive and thorough as one\n\nconducted for an approved product. Some outcomes of the comparability studies on quality attributes can lead to additional nonclinical or clinical studies.\n\nIn order for a comparability exercise to occur during development, appropriate assessment tools should be used. Analytical procedures used during development might not be validated, but should always be scientifically sound and provide results that are reliable and reproducible. Due to the limitations of the analytical tools in early clinical development, physicochemical and biological tests alone might be considered inadequate to determine comparability; therefore, bridging nonclinical and/or clinical studies, as appropriate, might be needed.\n\nNonclinical and Clinical Considerations (2.5)\n\n2.5.1 Factors To Be Considered in Planning Nonclinical and Clinical Studies (2.5.1)\n\nDeterminations of product comparability can be based solely on quality considerations (see section 2.2) if the manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies as suggested in this document. Additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is considered appropriate when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability. The extent and nature of nonclinical and clinical studies will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consideration of various factors, which include among others:\n\nQuality findings\n\nDrug product -- The type, nature, and extent of differences between the postchange product and the prechange product with respect to quality attributes including product-related substances, the impurity profile, stability, and excipients. For example, new impurities could warrant toxicological studies for qualification;\n\nResults of the evaluation/validation studies on the new process including the results of relevant in-process tests;\n\nAvailability, capabilities, and limitations of tests used for any comparability studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe nature and the level of knowledge of the product\n\nProduct complexity, including heterogeneity and higher order structure -- Physicochemical and in vitro biological assays might not be able to detect all differences in structure and/or function;\n\nStructure-activity relationship and strength of the association of quality attributes with safety and efficacy;\n\nRelationship between the therapeutic protein and endogenous proteins and the consequences for immunogenicity;\n\nMode(s) of action (unknown vs. known, single vs. multiple active sites).\n\nExisting nonclinical and clinical data relevant to the product, aspects of product use, and product class\n\nTherapeutic indications/target patient groups -- The impact of possible differences can vary between patient groups, e.g., risk for unintended immunogenicity. It may be appropriate to consider the consequences separately for each indication;\n\nPosology, e.g., dosing regimen, route of administration -- The risk of certain possible consequences of a difference, such as immunogenicity, could be higher with chronic administration as compared to short-term administration; subcutaneous administration might induce immunogenicity more often than intravenous administration;\n\nThe therapeutic window/dose-response curve -- The impact of a certain change could be different for products that have a wide therapeutic window as compared to those with a more narrow window. The safety or efficacy of products with a steep or a bell-shaped dose-response curve can be affected by minor changes in pharmacokinetics or receptor-binding;\n\nPrevious experience, e.g., immunogenicity, safety -- The experience with the original product or with other products in the same class can be relevant, especially with regard to rare adverse effects, e.g., knowledge about the consequences of immunogenicity;\n\nPharmacokine (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relation, distribution, clearance.\n\n2.2.2 Type of Studies (2.5.2)\n\nThe nonclinical and clinical studies referred to in this document might include, depending on the situation, PK studies, PD studies, PK/PD studies, clinical efficacy studies, specific safety studies, immunogenicity studies, and pharmacovigilance studies. The purpose of these studies is to enable comparison of pre- and postchange product. Where appropriate, these studies should be direct comparative studies.\n\nGLOSSARY (3)\n\nComparability Bridging Study: A study performed to provide nonclinical or clinical data that allows extrapolation of the existing data from the drug product produced by the current process to the drug product from the changed process.\n\nComparable: A conclusion that products have highly similar quality attributes before and after manufacturing process changes and that no adverse impact on the safety or efficacy, including immunogenicity, of the drug product occurred. This conclusion can be based on an analysis of product quality attributes. In some cases, nonclinical or clinical data might contribute to the conclusion.\n\nComparability Exercise: The activities, including study design, conduct of studies, and evaluation of data, that are designed to investigate whether the products are comparable.\n\nQuality Attribute: A molecular or product characteristic that is selected for its ability to help indicate the quality of the product. Collectively, the quality attributes define identity, purity, potency, and stability of the product, and safety with respect to adventitious agents.\n\nSpecifications measure a selected subset of the quality attributes.\n\nReferences (4)\n\nViral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived From Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin (Q5A).\n\nQuality of Biotechnological Products: Analysis of the Expression Construct in Cells Used for Production of r-DNA Derived Protein Products (Q5B).\n\nQuality of Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products (Q5C).\n\nQuality of Biotechnological Products: Derivation and Characterization of Cell Substrates Used for Production of Biotechnological/Biological Products (Q5D).\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products (Q6B).\n\nGood Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (Q7A).\n\nText on Validation of Analytical Procedures (Q2A).\n\nValidation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology (Q2B).\n\nCommon Technical Document for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (M4Q).\n\nStability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products (Q1AR).\n\nP Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (S6).\n\nStatistical Principles for Clinical Trials (E9).\n\nChoice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials (E10).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological:Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.354559898376465"], "As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nMedical Device Reporting for Manufacturers\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on: November 8, 2016\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on July 9, 2013.\n\nThis document supersedes \"Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers\" dated March 1997.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.

References to FDA regulations and Federal Register documents, as well as cross-references within this guidance document, are hyperlinked for your convenience. FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n1.2 What is the purpose of the MDR regulation?\n\nThe MDR regulation provides a mechanism that allows us (the FDA), as well as you (the device manufacturer), to identify and monitor adverse events (deaths and serious injuries) and certain malfunctions involving your medical devices. The goal is to detect and correct problems in a timely manner. The requirements of the MDR regulation are enforced under the authority of the FD&C Act. The enforcement mechanisms include seizure, injunction, civil money penalties, and criminal prosecution.\n\nThe MDR regulation also includes adverse event reporting and recordkeeping requirements for medical device user facilities (e.g., a hospital, ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, outpatient diagnostic facility, outpatient treatment facility), importers of medical devices, and medical device distributors.\n\n1.3 What are the basic requirements of the MDR regulation that apply to me?\n\nManufacturers, including foreign manufacturers, of legally marketed medical devices in the United States are required to:\n\nSubmit to us reports of MDR reportable events2 involving their medical devices [21 CFR 803.10(c) and 803.50];\n\nFootnote 2: The MDR regulation published on December 11, 1995 (60 FR 63578) also included requirements for manufacturers to submit Annual Certification using FDA Form 3381 and Baseline Reports using FDA Form 3417. The Annual Certification requirement was revoked by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 and removed from the regulation as published on January 26, 2000 (65 FR 4112). The Baseline Reporting requirement was removed from the regulation effective October 27, 2008 (73 FR 33692 and 73 FR 53686).\n* Develop, maintain, and implement written procedures for the identification and evaluation of all medical device events (e.g., malfunctions, serious injuries and deaths) to determine whether the event is an MDR reportable event [21 CFR 803.17] (for related information, see sections 2.10 and 3.1 of this guidance); and\n* Establish and maintain complete files for all complaints concerning medical device events [21 CFR 803.18] (for related information, see section 3.2 of this guidance).\n\n1.4 What are \"MDR reportable events\"?\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7699041366577148", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors must also report such information to FDA. Sponsors of drug/biologic studies are required under 21 CFR 312.31(a)(2) to report to FDA any information regarding the discontinuation of a clinical investigation in an information amendment to the Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Sponsors of device studies are required under 21 CFR 812.150(b)(2) to notify FDA and all reviewing IRBs and participating investigators of any withdrawal of IRB approval of an investigation or a part of an investigation within 5 working days after receipt of the withdrawal.\n\n(5) Confirming or establishing the date for the next continuing review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB performs a review at the time of clinical investigation transfer (whether an initial or a continuing review), it may choose to maintain the anniversary date of approval established by the original IRB or decide to establish a new anniversary date. If the receiving IRB decides to establish a new anniversary date, the new date must be within one year of the receiving IRB's review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB does not conduct a review of the clinical investigation at the time of transfer, the date of clinical investigation approval by the original IRB is presumed to remain in effect for the full approval period established at the time of the most recent review by the original IRB. For example, if the original IRB initially approved the clinical investigation for one year effective July 1, 2011, and the clinical investigation is transferred to a new IRB effective October 1, 2011, the expiration date of IRB approval would continue to be July 1, 2012, unless or until the receiving IRB establishes a new expiration date. Note that review in accordance with a newly established expiration date would nonetheless need to be conducted prior to the original July 1, 2012 expiration date.\n\n(6) Determining whether the consent form needs to be revised.\n\nThe informed consent document is required to contain \"[a]n explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject.\"35 Therefore, when a change in IRB oversight results in changes in the contact information regarding subject rights and/or whom to contact in the event of research-related injury, the new contact information must be provided to subjects. For subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active), this may be accomplished in a number of ways, including sending a letter providing the relevant contact information.36 For new subjects, the informed consent, assent, and/or parental permission form must be revised to reflect the new contact information.37 The clinical investigator should promptly notify the IRB of any such administrative changes to the consent form.\n\nFootnote 36: FDA does not require subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active) to be re-consented for such minor changes; however, IRBs may choose to do so.\n\nFootnote 37: 21 CFR 50.25(a)(7).\n\nOther changes to the consent form may also be necessary, for example, if the receiving IRB requires modifications to the consent form at the site(s) under its jurisdiction as a condition of approval (e.g., changes in template language, changes in risks, etc.).38 Depending upon the types of changes needed, they may be conveyed to the clinical investigator and sponsor as required modifications to secure IRB approval for the clinical investigation at that site or sites and may require reporting to FDA.39\n\nFootnote 38: 21 CFR 56.109(a) and (b).\n\nFootnote 39: 39 See, e.g., 21 CFR 56.109(a), 21 CFR 312.31, and 21 CFR 812.35.\n\nFootnote 40: 21 CFR 312.31(a).\n\n(7) Notifying the key parties.\n\nAs discussed above, all key parties involved in the transfer of oversight (e.g., clinical investigator, sponsor, and original and receiving IRBs) should discuss their respective responsibilities before implementing the transfer. In addition, the sponsor should notify pertinent entities involved in the clinical investigation (e.g., institutional members, Data Safety Monitoring Board, CRO), as and when appropriate. After IRB transfer of oversight for the clinical investigation is complete, the sponsor must update the associated IND40 or IDE41 with the name and contact information of the receiving IRB and should include the effective date of transfer.\n\nFootnote 41: 21 CFR 812.35(a)(4).\n\nFor studies for which the original IRB acts as a central IRB, those local institutions/IRBs that have written agreements with the original IRB (to transfer review responsibility to that original IRB) should be notified that responsibility for the study is now being transferred to a new central IRB (receiving IRB). We recommend that those local institutions/IRBs be given the option to enter into new written agreements with the receiving IRB or opt out of the central review arrangement if they do not believe central review by the receiving IRB is appropriate for their local institution (e.g., are concerned about the ability of the receiving IRB to adequately address local issues).42\n\nFootnote 42: For more information on the responsibilities of central IRBs and local institutions/IRBs with respect to central IRB review, see \u201cUsing a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,\u201d available at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127004.htm.\n\nAdditionally, when an IRB declines to accept oversight of a clinical investigation, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the appropriate party(ies) who initiated the transfer process (refer to page 3 for further information; parties responsible for initiating the transfer may not be those responsible for securing IRB review) to enable the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to make alternate arrangements for IRB review.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]\n\nthe reasons for the transfer and the risk posed by the study. In the case of a natural disaster, although the transfer may initially be thought to only be required for a short period of time, additional time may ultimately be needed before the original IRB is able to resume its oversight responsibilities. The original and receiving IRBs would need to ensure that study oversight does not lapse; adverse events are reported to the appropriate IRB, etc. during this interim period.\n\nAppendix B Transfer of a Clinical Investigation to a New Research Site Requiring IRB Review\n\nA sponsor may decide to transfer a clinical investigation to a different research site when, for instance, a clinical investigator relocates to that new site. Because the transfer involves changes to the research (i.e., conducting the research in a new location, consent form revisions, possible changes in key staff, etc.), the sponsor or investigator must submit these changes to the receiving IRB for review and approval, prior to implementing the changes.44 In many cases, these changes represent a \"minor change\" to the research, which the IRB may review under an expedited review procedure.45\n\nSuch a move to a new research site may or may not entail changing the IRB. If the reviewing IRB changes as a result, then the considerations described in Section III apply, except initial or continuing IRB review must be conducted (an IRB may not approve a change in research without first conducting an initial or continuing review).46\n\nFDA notes that, even if the IRB remains the same when a study is transferred to a new research site, IRB review/approval for the new research site is required because such a move is considered a change in previously approved research.47 Additionally, the sponsor must notify FDA of any change in research site, clinical investigator, and/or IRB. For drug or biologics studies, this notification can generally be accomplished through an IND protocol or information amendment, whereas for device studies it can generally be accomplished in an IDE annual report.48\n\nFootnote 44: 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4). For drug/biologic studies, clinical investigators are responsible for securing IRB approval under 21 CFR 312.66; for device studies, the sponsor is responsible under 21 CFR 812.35(a)(1) and (3).\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2).\n\nFootnote 46: 21 CFR 56.103(a), 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4), and 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2). There is an exception to this general requirement: changes necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects may be initiated without IRB review and approval, as described in 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: 21 Didd.\n\nFootnote 48: 21 CFR 312.30, 21 CFR 312.31, 21 CFR 812.35, and 21 CFR 812.150(b)(5). For a discussion of the types of changes in an IND study that require a new Form 1572, refer to Question 7 of FDA\u2019s Guidance \u201cFrequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572),\u201davailable at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm214282.pdf\n\nAppendix V Additional Questions about Transferring oversight of a Clinical Investigation\n\nOccasionally, during the course of its initial or continuing review of a transferred clinical investigation or at other times during oversight transfer, an original or receiving IRB may have questions that are not resolvable through communications with the sponsor or clinical investigator. In such situations, either IRB may contact FDA for additional guidance. Affected sponsors and clinical investigators may also contact FDA in these situations. Please use the following as an initial point of contact:\n\nBioresearch Monitoring Branch, Division of Inspections and Surveillance, Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality * Phone: (301) 827-6221 * Email: industry.biologics@fda.gov\n\nOffice of Scientific Investigations, Office of Compliance * Phone: (301) 796-3150 * Email: cder-osi@fda.hhs.gov\n\nDivision of Bioresearch Monitoring, Office of Compliance * Phone: (301) 796-5490 * Email: bimo@cdrh.fda.gov\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations When Transferring Clinical Investigation Oversight to Another IRB Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.28716516494751", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: This formal review of the research effort, as required under 21 CFR 56.109(f), is the subject of this guidance. An IRB must review previously approved research at least once a year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). Review must be conducted at convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, unless the research qualifies for review through an expedited process (21 CFR 56.108(c) and 56.110). See Section III.D. of this guidance for more information on the application of expedited review procedures to continuing review.\n\nIRBs involved in multi-site studies may find it difficult to conduct a thorough review with data solely from the site(s) under their purview and may need to obtain study-wide information. Sponsors are in the unique position of having information for the entire study6 and may provide it to investigators, who in turn provide it to the IRBs. FDA's regulations do not prohibit sponsors from providing study-wide information directly to IRBs.7 FDA encourages efforts by investigators and sponsors to ensure that IRBs receive meaningful study-wide information, particularly when doing so may assist IRBs in reviewing the studies and protecting subjects.\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cAdverse Event Reporting to IRBs \u2013 Improving Human Subject Protection,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126572.pdf.\n\nFootnote 7: Note that FDA\u2019s regulations for device studies specifically assign general responsibility to sponsors \u201c...for ensuring IRB review and approval are obtained and ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation...\u201d 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nOne way to enable a useful continuing review of multi-site studies while reducing or eliminating duplication of effort is through the use of cooperative review agreements or other mechanisms (e.g., using a centralized IRB review process), in accordance with 21 CFR 56.114. Cooperative agreements may vary with respect to how continuing review will be carried out. For example, some agreements may designate a specific IRB as having primary responsibility for continuing review of an investigation.8 Other agreements may assign responsibility for local issues to the institution's IRB, but assign the remaining aspects of continuing review to a central IRB.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cUsing a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080606.pdf.\n\nWhatever the arrangement, the IRB(s) responsible for continuing review of multi-site studies may find it helpful to obtain and review information across the entire study. For additional discussion, see Section III.B. of this guidance.\n\nAppendix A Criteria for Approving Research During Continuing Review\n\nFDA regulations set forth the criteria for IRB approval of research (21 CFR 56.111). These criteria apply to both initial review and continuing review. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of following requirements are satisfied:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized;\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result;\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable;\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and appropriately documented;\n\nWhere appropriate, the research plan adequately provides for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects;\n\nWhere appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data;\n\nAppropriate additional safeguards are included to protect vulnerable subjects; and\n\nWhere the study involves children, the research complies with 21 CFR part 50, Subpart D.\n\nThe IRB makes its continuing review determination by considering whether any new information is available that would affect the IRB's prior finding that the research meets the criteria in 21 CFR 56.111. IRBs have authority to disapprove or require modifications in (to secure re- approval of) a research activity that does not meet any of the above criteria (e.g., the full study or any part thereof, such as changes to the protocol, advertisements; 21 CFR 56.109(a))\n\nAppendix B Process for Conducting Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review takes place at a convened meeting of the IRB, unless it meets the criteria for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110. (See 21 CFR 56.108(c) and Section III.D. of this guidance.) The IRB is required to review the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)) and must maintain records of its continuing review activities, including minutes of meetings at which such activities are undertaken (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) and (3)). The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show actions taken by the IRB, and the vote on these actions, and to summarize the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For research to be approved, a majority of IRB members present at a meeting must approve it (21 CFR 56.108(c)).\n\nThe IRB must ensure that a member does not participate in the IRB's continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB (21 CFR 56.107(e)). Meeting minutes must reflect meeting attendance, the votes taken, and a summary of the discussion and resolution of controverted issues, and should provide confirmation that conflicted members did not participate in the IRB's continuing review of their studies (21 CFR 56.115((a)(2)). FDA recommends that IRB members with a conflicting interest in a project recuse themselves by leaving the meeting room when the IRB conducts continuing review of that project, except when requested by the IRB to be present to provide information.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis IRB member recusal should be noted in the minutes of the IRB meeting when recording votes on IRB actions.\n\nAn IRB must maintain and follow written procedures for the continuing review of research (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) and 56.115(a)(6)). In developing procedures for continuing review, the IRB should consider the use of templates, checklists, or other tools to standardize the request for information or list of materials to be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that studies they conduct comply with applicable regulatory requirements.9 To ensure that the reviewing IRB can carry out its review prior to the expiration date of the current IRB approval, investigators should follow the IRB's policies and procedures for continuing IRB review of research (procedures required by 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1)), in particular by submitting materials and information required by the IRB. FDA encourages IRBs to make investigators aware of the IRB's procedures, for example, by enclosing a copy in correspondence informing the investigator of the IRB's decisions, or posting the information on a website.\n\nFootnote 9: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.60, 312.66, 812.36(c)(viii), 812.100, 812.110(b), 812.40, and 812.43(c)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recommends that the IRB's written procedures call for submission of the following information for consideration by the IRB in continuing review, if not already available to the IRB as part of the existing IRB records for the research10:\n\nFootnote 10: Some of this information may come from the sponsor, who would have access to data across all study sites.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA or \"we\") developed this guidance to clarify our position regarding manufacturers appropriately and responsibly sharing \"patient-specific information\" - information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient's treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device - with that patient at that patient's request. This guidance provides information and recommendations to industry, healthcare providers, and FDA staff about the mechanisms and considerations for device manufacturers sharing such information with individual patients when they request it.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nIncreasingly, patients seek to play an active role in their own healthcare. FDA is aware that sometimes a patient will request that a manufacturer share with her information about herself that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device. FDA is issuing this guidance to clarify our position regarding manufacturers appropriately and responsibly sharing \"patient-specific information\" - information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient's treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device - with that patient at that patient's request. FDA believes that sharing \"patient-specific information\" with patients upon their request may assist them in being more engaged with their healthcare providers in making sound medical decisions.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, \"patient-specific information\" is information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient's treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device. This information may include, but is not limited to, recorded patient data, device usage/output statistics, healthcare provider inputs, incidence of alarms, and/or records of device malfunctions or failures. For the purposes of this guidance, patient-specific information does not include any interpretations of data by the manufacturer aside from those interpretations of data normally reported by the device to the patient or the patient's healthcare provider. For example, results of individual component tests for specific analytes that comprise or are utilized in a cleared assay but have not been individually approved or cleared to test for those specific analytes are not \"patient-specific information\" for purposes of this guidance and so fall outside the scope of the guidance.\n\nGenerally, categories of patient-specific information may include, but are not limited to: (1) data a healthcare provider inputs in the device to record the status and ongoing treatment of an individual patient or (2) information stored by the device to record usage, alarms, or outputs (e.g., pulse oximetry data, heart electrical activity, and rhythms as monitored by a pacemaker). Patient-specific case logs entered into a medical device by a healthcare provider may be included under this definition. This information may be used to facilitate continuity of care, to create an adequate patient treatment history and current treatment profile, and to record information relating to medical device functionality.\n\nIV. Patient-Specific Information Sharing Policy\n\nIn many cases, patient-specific information from a medical device is accessible by the patient's healthcare provider and patients can contact their healthcare provider to obtain such information. Alternatively, patients may contact the manufacturer directly and request access to their patient-specific information. In general, although not required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), manufacturers may share patient-specific information about a patient with that patient at that patient's request. In general, manufacturers may do so without undergoing additional premarket review in advance. FDA generally would not consider patient-specific information to be \"labeling,\" as defined in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act. FDA is aware that when manufacturers share patient-specific information with patients, manufacturers also may provide them with supplemental information or other materials (e.g., descriptions of intended use, benefit and risk information, instructions for use) that may be considered labeling. Any labeling is subject to applicable requirements in the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nWe are aware that some devices are designed to record or transmit information in a format that is not easily provided to the patient. Other devices record and retain information in a closed system that is not accessible by the manufacturer. In such circumstances, it may not be feasible for manufacturers to share patient-specific information with patients as doing so would require manufacturers to redesign devices or gain access to information they do not have.\n\nGenerally, if patient-specific information is shared with patients by manufacturers, it should be comprehensive and contemporary. For example, if a patient requests from a manufacturer a history of her own blood pressure measurements from a device, the data should include all available data up through the most recent measurement. Manufacturers may also format the patient-specific information to facilitate its usability by the patient.\n\nFDA recognizes the important role healthcare providers play in providing interpretation of and context to patient-specific information. FDA recommends that manufacturers advise patients to contact their healthcare providers should they have any questions about their patient-specific information.\n\nFinally, this guidance does not affect any federal, state or local laws or regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (42 U.S.C. SS 300gg; 29 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. SS 1320d et seq.) and the associated HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164), which may otherwise be applicable to the provision of patient-specific information. Moreover, the guidance does not change FDA's policy and is not intended to supersede any other relevant policies and guidances regarding manufacturers' communications about their devices.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturers Sharing Patient-Specific Information from Medical Devices with Patients Upon Request Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.635673999786377", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: Generally, OCP will respond to the sponsor in writing within sixty days of the RFD filing, identifying the classification of the product as a drug, device, biological product, or combination product. If the Agency does not provide a written response within sixty days, the sponsor's recommendation respecting the classification of the product is considered to be the final determination. 21 USC 360bbb-2(b) and (c).\n\nRFD determinations pertain only to the product as described in the designation letter, including its proposed use(s) or indication(s) for use. The Agency may modify a determination made under section 563 regarding the classification of a product or the component of FDA that will regulate the product either with the written consent of the sponsor or for public health reasons based on scientific evidence. 21 USC 360bbb-2(b) and (c).8\n\nFootnote 8: The sponsor may request reconsideration of the decision if its classification recommendation is not adopted by the Agency. See 21 CFR 3.8, 10.75. If the sponsor develops or becomes aware of new information that may affect the product\u2019s classification, the sponsor may also submit a new RFD seeking a new determination.\n\nA new determination may be appropriate if there is a change in, for example, a proposed indication for use or in a component of the product, or if the sponsor or Agency becomes aware of additional information that reveals that the means by which the product achieves its primary intended purposes differ from what was originally described in the RFD. For example, if a sponsor wished to change the indication for a product and that new indication would be achieved through a different mechanism than the original indication, a different classification for the new indication might be appropriate.\n\nPlease contact OCP if you have questions regarding whether to submit an RFD, what information to provide, or issues to address in an RFD to ensure its completeness and clarity.9\n\nFootnote 9: More detailed information on the RFD process is provided in OCP\u2019s guidance How to Write a Request for Designation (RFD), available at http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126053.htm. A pre-RFD process is available if a sponsor wishes to obtain a preliminary, non-binding classification determination or to engage in preliminary classification discussions with the Agency before filing a formal RFD. The RFD and pre-RFD processes are also available to sponsors to clarify the Center assignment for medical products, though this issue is beyond the scope of this guidance. More information about the pre-RFD process is available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm534898.pdf_.\n\n3 What Does FDA Consider in Determining Whether to Classify a Product as a Drug or Device?\n\nFDA's determination of whether to classify a product as a drug or device is based on statutory definitions, as set forth in sections 201(g) and 201(h) of the FD&C Act, respectively. We apply these definitions to products, relying on the scientific data that are available to FDA at the time of the classification determination concerning the product for its proposed use(s)/indication(s).10\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor example, if the primary intended purpose of a hip joint replacement implant is to restore movement, and the implant also elicits a foreign body response through chemical action, that response would not be considered a primary intended purpose of the implant. Accordingly, such an implant could be classified as a device despite the chemical action, because such action does not achieve the product's primary intended purpose. Similarly, if the primary intended purpose of an absorbable suture is to rejoin tissue, and the suture is also designed to be resorbed by the body through a combination of chemical action and metabolic activities, such resorption would not be considered a primary intended purpose of the product. Accordingly, such an absorbable suture could be classified as a device despite the chemical action and metabolic activity, because such action or activity does not achieve the product's primary intended purpose.\n\n3 \"Chemical action\" in the definition of device\n\nFDA frequently receives questions from product sponsors concerning the Agency's interpretation of the term \"chemical action.\" This term must be read in the context of the statutory definition of \"device\" as a whole. The determination of whether a product meets the device definition does not depend solely on whether the product exhibits \"chemical action.\" In particular, as explained in section III.B.2 and 4, a product that exhibits chemical action will still meet the device definition if the product \"does not achieve its primary intended purposes through\" that chemical action \"within or on the body,\" and otherwise satisfies the device definition.\n\nUnder the Agency's interpretation of the device definition, a product exhibits \"chemical action\" if it interacts at the molecular level with bodily components (e.g., cells or tissues) to mediate (including promoting or inhibiting) a bodily response, or with foreign entities (e.g., organisms or chemicals) so as to alter that entity's interaction with the body.12 We note that this type of interaction is consistent with the term \"pharmacological action\" as that term is generally understood in the medical field. Accordingly, we have used \"pharmacological action\" as a shorthand throughout the rest of this guidance for ease of explication and recognition. The examples presented in section III.B.5 offer illustration of FDA's interpretation of chemical action.\n\nFootnote 12: For purposes of this interpretation, an interaction at the molecular level occurs through either chemical reaction (i.e., formation or breaking of covalent or ionic bonds), intermolecular forces (e.g., electrostatic interactions), or both. The mere exchange of non-chemical energy (e.g., electromagnetic or thermal energy) between a product and the body would not constitute \u201cchemical action.\u201d\n\n4 \"Within or on the body\" in the definition of device\n\nBecause a device \"does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals\" (emphasis added), a product can be a device even if it achieves its primary intended purposes through chemical action, so long as the chemical action does not occur \"within or on the body\" (and the product meets the other elements of the definition of device under section 201(h)).\n\nWhether chemical action is occurring \"within or on the body\" is generally a straightforward matter. If the chemical action is occurring inside the body or on the surface of the body, it is within or on the body. For example, the chemical action of an orally ingested pillor tablet of a decongestant would be \"within the body,\" and the chemical action of a spray or cream for treatment of dermatitis when applied to the skin would be \"on the body.\" Similarly, it is generally a straightforward matter to determine that chemical action is not occurring within or on the body. For example, the chemical action of an antimicrobial agent used to clean a surgical instrument before that instrument is used is not occurring within or on the body.\n\nHowever, the Agency has on occasion considered some situations in which it may be less clear whether chemical action is occurring within or on the body. For example, we have determined that chemical action occurring solely within an extracorporeal device, specifically a kidney hemodialysisism machine, is not occurring within or on the body. Similarly, we have determined that the chemical action of a transport solution to preserve a donor organ for transplantation while in an organ transport container is not occurring within or on the body.\n\n5 Illustrative Examples\n\nThe following examples further illustrate the application of some of the key provisions of the device definition discussed above. Table 1 contains some examples of medical products that achieve their primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body. Table 2 contains some examples of medical products that do not achieve their primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \\hline Product & Description \\ \\hline Aspirin & Aspirin is used for pain relief.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed this document to provide guidance to industry and FDA staff about the appropriate use of national and international voluntary consensus standards (referred to as consensus standards) in the preparation and evaluation of premarket submissions for medical devices.\n\nFor the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site at\n\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nVoluntary consensus standards can be a valuable resource for industry and FDA staff. The use of consensus standards can increase predictability, streamline premarket review, provide clearer regulatory expectations, and facilitate market entry for safe and effective medical products. Consensus standards provide a consensus approach to certain aspects of the evaluation of device safety and effectiveness, such as testing methods, acceptance criteria, and processes to address areas such as risk management and usability. The use of consensus standards can also promote international harmonization. For decades, FDA has supported and relied on the development anduse of consensus standards to support the Agency's mission in protecting and promoting the public health.\n\n1 The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (Pub. L. No. 104-113), codifying an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive, Circular A-119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities, that had previously been issued several times, dating back to the late 1970s.1 The NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 established Federal government policies to improve the internal management of the Executive Branch by directing agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards except where voluntary consensus standards are inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical.2\n\nFootnote 1: See more information at https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/what-we-do/federal-policy-standards/key-federal-directives.\n\nFootnote 2: Pub. L. No. 104-113, 110 Stat. 775, 783, \u00a7 12(d) (March 7, 1996).\n\n2 The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act and 21st Century Cures Act\n\nCongress also enacted the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. No. 105-115) and the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), which amended section 514(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Section 514(c) states, in part, that FDA \"shall, by publication in the Federal Register... recognize all or part of an appropriate standard established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development organization for which a person may submit a declaration of conformity in order to meet a premarket submission requirement or other requirement,\" 21 U.S.C. 360d(c)(1)(A).\n\nThe term \"recognize\" in section 514(c) of the FD&C Act refers to FDA's formal identification of a standard after a determination that it is appropriate for manufacturers of products to declare conformance to meet relevant requirements in the FD&C Act, including premarket submission requirements.\n\nThis guidance refers to voluntary consensus standards recognized by FDA in the Federal Register in accordance with section 514(c) of the FD&C Act as \"FDA-recognized consensus standards.\" A list of consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize is available on the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site.3 See section 4 for more information about standards that FDA has decided to recognize but for which recognition is still pending.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm\n\nUse of consensus standards to meet premarket submission requirements can help facilitate the premarket review process and is not limited to use in Abbreviated Premarket Notifications (510(k)s), but can also be used for any 510(k), De Novo request, Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, Product Development Protocol (PDP), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, Investigational New Drug(IND) Application, or Biologics License Application (BLA) for those devices that are regulated by CBER as biological products under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. However, in most cases the standards would only satisfy part of the submission requirements. In addition, submitters may choose to conform to applicable consensus standards or address issues relevant to approval or clearance in another manner.4 Regardless of the decision a submitter ultimately makes about the use of consensus standards, submitters should make sure their premarket submissions contain all necessary information, as required by the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations.5\n\nFootnote 4: In the context of this guidance, \u201csubmitter\u201d may refer to the holder of a premarket submission, manufacturer, sponsor, or applicant.\n\nFootnote 5: In the case of a device regulated as a biologic under a BLA by CBER, additional information may be required under the PHS Act.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance describes the appropriate use and documentation of both FDA-recognized and non-recognized consensus standards for premarket submissions and how FDA staff intends to rely on consensus standards during the review process. This guidance provides further clarity and explanation about the regulatory framework, policies, and practices regarding the appropriate utilization of consensus standards for premarket submissions. This guidance is applicable to all articles that meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nUnder section 514(c) of the FD&C Act, conformity with consensus standards can fulfill requirements other than premarket submission requirements; this use is not discussed in this guidance. This guidance also does not address the specific content required in a particular premarket submission. Additionally, this guidance does not address consensus standards that are incorporated by reference (IBR) into regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 830.10, Incorporation by reference regarding requirements for a Unique Device Identifier). For additional information, see the Standards Incorporated by Reference Database Website.6\n\nFootnote 6: https://standards.gov/sibr/query/index.cfm\n\nIV. Use of Consensus Standards\n--------------------\nContext title: Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.208033561706543"], "Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: The Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n\nCan I put only a 2D data matrix barcode on my product as required under the DSCSA in lieu of the linear barcode that is required under SS 201.25, since it also includes the NDC number?\n\nNo. At this time, a 2D data matrix barcode may not be used as a substitution for a linear barcode when one is required under SS 201.25 for packages of product.\n\nCan a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n\nYes. A manufacturer or repackager may voluntarily put the 2D data matrix barcode on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container, if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nExamples of When the Product Identifier Is Required Under the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Is Required Under SS 201.25\n\nFor each of their products, manufacturers and repackagers are responsible for determining the smallest individual saleable unit that they intend for ultimate sale to a dispenser. Under the DSCSA, both a 2D data matrix barcode and the human-readable portion of the product identifier are required to be affixed or imprinted on each such individual saleable unit. While other levels of product packaging may exist that do not require a 2D data matrix barcode, as noted in Question and Answer #19, manufacturers and repackagers may voluntarily affix or imprint a 2D data matrix barcode if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nThe following table provides examples of different units of a package or case and what barcode would be required under the DSCSA and under SS 201.25. It is not an exhaustive list because the information required will depend on the specific details of particular product packaging.\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.138907432556152", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product's standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a \"2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for packages and in a \"linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using \"human-readable or machine-readable methods.\"11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled \"Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,\" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency's thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A \"product\" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a \"prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.\"\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of \u201ctransaction\u201d (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a \"product\" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining \u201cproduct.\u201d\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of \u201cproduct\u201d under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products.

For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA's draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for \"products,\" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. \"Prescription drugs\" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of \"labeling\" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant's annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., \"lot number\" and \"expiration date\") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.7124173641204834", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProceduralProduct Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -\n\nCompliance Policy\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are availablefrom:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{\\text{th}}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drug/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: (ocod)@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers \"affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce\" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms \u201chomogeneous\u201d and \u201chomogenous\u201d are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term \u201chomogenous\u201d throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product's standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.1634650230407715", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not address how to link a repackager SNI to a manufacturer SNI, nor does it address standards for prescription drug SNI at levels other than the package-level including, for example, the case- and pallet-levels. Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, \"Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA\u2019s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.4090205430984497"], "Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n\nA general comparison appears in the FDA's Good Clinical Practice program website, Comparison of FDA and HHS Human Subject Protection Regulations found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/EducaionalMaterials/ucm112910.htm. For additional information on 45 CFR Part 46\n\nsubpart A refer to the Office for Human Research Protections at\n\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm.\nYes, in many cases an investigational IVD study is eligible for IRB expedited review (see 21 CFR 56.110), for both initial approval and continuing review. The categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure are described in the Federal Register notice on expedited review, found at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm118099.htm. As stated in a Federal Register notice, however, sponsors and investigators may not use the expedited review procedure where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998).\n\n6. Can leftover specimens be used in IVD studies without informed consent?\n\nThe document entitled, \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm078384.htm, describes the limited circumstances in which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding requirements for informed consent. (See Glossary for definition of \"leftover specimens\".)\n\n7. Can those who routinely conduct studies with IVDs (e.g., research hospitals) use a general informed consent to address future studies using samples collected in their own facility?\n\nTo fulfill FDA informed consent requirements for studies of IVDs, a site may develop an informed consent process to address the use of samples collected at the facility (see the Glossary for definition) in a specific study or for a broader category of future studies. This general informed consent process may be used for subjects seen at and/or admitted to a specific facility. The informed consent document must contain all of the required elements found in 21 CFR 50.25.\n\n8. Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process?\n\nIf the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm078384.htm.\n\nVI. Data Considerations\n\n1. What information should the protocol include to ensure that the investigational IVD study will be scientifically sound?\n\nWe recommend that the protocol include a clear description of study design; objectives, estimation of performance goals (e.g., desired confidence interval widths) that are directly related to the intended claims for the IVD device, or hypotheses; and a statistical plan to be applied to the data. (See the Glossary for definitions of protocol, statistical hypothesis, and confidence interval.)\n\n2. Is it acceptable to develop new or to revise existing study hypotheses as the study progresses?\n\nWe generally believe it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions from after-the-fact hypotheses. We recommend that changes in study protocols be carefully documented and explained. FDA encourages sponsors to contact the appropriate review division to discuss studies before they are initiated and to consult FDA before changes in protocols are made mid-study. (For the FDA divisions responsible for review of IVD products, see Introduction, Section II, of this guidance.)\n\n3. How should I determine appropriate sample size for a study?\n\nThe sponsor should formulate sample size based on standard statistical techniques and the sample size should account for any unique issues related to intended use(s), device technologies, and/or the biology of the condition being studied.\n\nWhat guidance is available for sponsors to determine how to estimate IVD performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, how to handle discrepant results, and what to do when a study is performed without a truth standard (\"gold standard\") (see the Glossary for definitions)?\n\nFDA has recognized a number of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [(CLSI), formerly National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)] standards related to these issues. A list of these standards, but not the standards themselves, can be found through the database on the CDRH web page http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scrlpts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards\n\nThe agency's guidance entitled \"Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests\" can be viewed at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm071148.htm\n\nHow much leeway is there in deciding on the populations from which human specimens are collected and under what conditions are data on simulated specimens (see the Glossary for definition) acceptable?\n\nStudies should be performed in a representative sample of the intended use population (i.e., representation of both diseased and non-diseased cases, and controlling for subject demographics and morbidity factors that may affect the level of device performance). When a disease is rare or samples are needed specifically to challenge cut-off points, sponsors may use enriched samples, panels of credentialed samples (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panels), and/or spiked or contrived samples. The acceptance of simulated specimens depends on how well they represent specimens from the intended-use population and whether their performance accurately reflects what the IVD device user can expect.\n\nIs it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including \"outliers\". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA's regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term \"new system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term \"old system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA's Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.13202233612537384", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA's human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, \"Investigational Device Exemptions.\"\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA's letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA's letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA's IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, \u201cProcedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices\u201d at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor's description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of \"significant risk\" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.20669306814670563", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: III.Scope\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to industry and FDA staff about the content of 510(k) submissions and the decision-making process for determining substantial equivalence of devices reviewed under the 510(k) program. The guidance has been organized to coincide with the critical decision points outlined in the 510(k) Decision-Making Flowchart (See Appendix A), which has been updated to track section 513(i) of the FD&C Act and relevant regulations more closely. This document provides guidance on the following issues:\n\nthe appropriate use of multiple predicates (See Section IV.C);\n\nthe processes associated with determining whether a new device with new indications for use has a new intended use (See Section IV.D);\n\nthe process for determining whether different technological characteristics raise different questions of safety and effectiveness (See Section IV.E);\n\nwhen performance data, with special emphasis on clinical performance data, may be necessary to support an SE determination (See Section IV.F); and\n\nhow to develop 510(k) Summaries to promote greater transparency in the 510(k) decision-making process (See Section IV.G).\n\nThe overarching principles in this guidance are applicable to devices that are subject to 510(k) review by CDRH, including the Office of Device Evaluation (ODE) and the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health (OIR), as well as devices that are subject to 510(k) review by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). This guidance is not intended to supplant existing device-specific guidance, but may cover broader areas not addressed in device-specific guidance documents. If you have questions about how this guidance and a device-specific guidance apply to a particular issue, please contact FDA to discuss. In addition, this guidance does not address review issues unique to combination products. For information on combination products, please refer to the Office of Combination Products webpage\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/OfficeofScien\n\nceandHealthCoordination/ucm2018184.htm).\n\nIV. The 510(k) Decision-Making Process\n\nA 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the new device to be marketed is \"substantially equivalent\" to a legally marketed device9 (21 U.S.C. SSS 360(k), 360(n), 360c(f)(1) & 360c(i); 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)) which is not subject to PMA. Manufacturers must compare their new device to a similar legally marketed device to support its substantial equivalence (21 U.S.C. SS 360c(i); 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)).\n\nFootnote 9: Under 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3), a legally marketed device to which a new device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I, or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process.\n\nThe most commonly used method of demonstrating substantial equivalence is through the submission and FDA review and clearance of a Traditional 510(k). Under 21 CFR 807.87, FDA established basic content requirements for 510(k)s to be submitted by device manufacturers in support of substantial equivalence. The Agency has provided a general framework on how to format an original submission for a Traditional 510(k) in FDA's Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, \"Format for\nTraditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm0843\n\n65.htm). Although the basic content requirements apply to all 510(k)s, the type of data and information necessary to establish substantial equivalence varies by the type of device and the differences between the new device and the predicate device. FDA has issued many device-specific guidance documents that clarify the data that should be included in 510(k)s for particular device types. If a manufacturer is unsure of what information to include within a 510(k) submission, the manufacturer may contact FDA and submit a pre-submission to seek additional feedback to ensure submissions contain appropriate data elements. For more information on the pre-submission process, see FDA's Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, \"Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument\n\ns/UCM311176.pdf).\n\nPlease note that the use of the Standards Data Report for 510(k)s (Form 3654)\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM081667.pdf), recognized consensus standards, and device-specific guidance documents is not limited to Abbreviated 510(k) submissions. Appropriate reliance on these documents can facilitate the review of all 510(k) submissions and can help to make the review process more consistent. Medical device manufacturers should consider relying on and citing to standards and device-specific guidance documents wherever appropriate, regardless of the type of 510(k) submission.\n\nA new device does not need to be identical to the predicate device for it to be found substantially equivalent to the predicate device. In FDA's experience, it is rare for a new device to be identical to a predicate device. Given the diversity of technologies evaluated under this review standard, this guidance adopts a flexible approach to determining \"substantial equivalence\" to accommodate evolving technology while maintaining predictability and consistency to promote confidence among device developers, practitioners, and patients.\n\nAppendix A The 510(k) Review Standard\n\na.1.1 The Statutory Standard\n\nThe 510(k) review standard (substantial equivalence of a new device to a legally marketed (predicate) device) differs from the PMA review standard (reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness). The 510(k) review standard is comparative, whereas the PMA standard relies on an independent demonstration of safety and effectiveness. Nonetheless, the principles of safety and effectiveness underlie the substantial equivalence determination in every 510(k) review. The standard for a determination of substantial equivalence in a 510(k) review is set out in section 513(i) of the FD&C Act, which states:\n\nSubstantial Equivalence\n\n(i)(1)(A) For purposes of determinations of substantial equivalence under subsection (f) and section 520(l), the term \"substantially equivalent\" or \"substantial equivalence\" means, with respect to a device being compared to a predicate device, that the device has the same intended use as the predicate device and that the Secretary by order has found that the device Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(i) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or\n\n(ii)(I) has different technological characteristics and the information submitted that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary by the Secretary or a person accredited under section 523, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device, and (II) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device.\n\n(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \"different technological characteristics\" means, with respect to a device being compared to a predicate device, that there is a significant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features of the device from those of the predicate device.\n\nSafety and effectiveness factor into both parts of the FDA's review. First, FDA must find that the intended use of the device and its predicate are \"the same.\" As discussed in the Intended Use Section of this guidance, differences in the indications for use, such as the population for which a device is intended or the disease a device is intended to treat do not necessarily result in a new intended use. Such differences result in a new intended use when they affect (or may affect) the safety and/or effectiveness of the new device as compared to the predicate device and the differences cannot be adequately evaluated under the comparative standard of substantial equivalence. (See Section IV.D.)\n\nSecond, when comparing a new device to a predicate device, FDA must find that the two devices have \"the same technological characteristics,\" or that a \"significant change in the materials, design, energy source or other features of the device\" does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness and that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device.\n--------------------\nContext title: The 510(k) Program- Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)] Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5991101264953613", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/assay-migration-studies-vitro-diagnostic-devices.\n\nOption 3: As an alternative to comparison study designs, for certain test systems, flex and human factors engineering studies may provide sufficient assurance that the change in user populations and environment of use between non-waived and waived settings will not adversely impact the results provided by the candidate test; i.e., that the likelihood of erroneous results by the users is negligible. Possible study design approaches that may be suitable include flex study designs described in section IV above and human factor study designs described in FDA's guidance \"Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineeringto Medical Devices.\"23 FDA believes this approach is generally appropriate for test systems for which:\n\nFootnote 23: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices.\n\ncollection of a specimen is either always performed by a professional (for example, an endocervical swab collected by a doctor) or always by a patient (for example, a urine specimen collected by the patient), and\n\nother pre-analytical steps are very simple (for example, placement of the entire specimen in the analyzer), and\n\nintended use patient populations are sufficiently similar.\n\nAdditionally, another scenario where this option may be appropriate is a CLIA waiver application for a modification of a previously waived test system where the Quick Reference Guide was not modified (or minimally modified). FDA encourages manufacturers considering modification of a test system previously waived by application to contact FDA through a Pre-Submission to discuss planned modifications, as well as study designs and analyses to validate that the modified test system meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver.24\n\nFootnote 24: A Pre-Submission is a type of Q-Submission. For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nOption 4: Comparison study designs in which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained operators. This option is also useful for Dual Submissions where a 510(k) and CLIA waiver are being sought concurrently.\n\nFor general recommendations on comparison study design and analysis for Options 1 and 4, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as:\n\nFor quantitative tests: CLSI EP21,25 CLSI EP27.26 Footnote 25: CLSI EP21 Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative tests: CLSI EP12.27 Footnote 26: CLSI EP27 How to Construct and Interpret an Error Grid for Quantitative Diagnostic Assays.\n\nFor Options 1, 2, and 4, if sufficient valid scientific evidence on the imprecision of the test and the performance of the test at low levels (limit of detection and limit of quantitation) when performed by untrained operators is not available from the studies described above, additional studies should be performed to allow comparison of the imprecision and limit of detection/limit of quantitation of the test when performed by untrained and trained operators. We recommend following appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g., CLSI EP05,28 CLSI EP12, CLSI EP1729) for these studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to submit a Pre-Submission to obtain feedback from FDA on planned study designs prior to conducting the study. FDA welcomes discussion of additional study design approaches besides the four options presented in this guidance.30\n\nFootnote 30: For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The O-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nAppendix B Considerations in Satisfying CLIA Waiver Requirements\n\nOne statutory criteria that a test can meet to obtain a CLIA waiver centers on the simplicity of the test and whether the user can conduct the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.31 All tests have some likelihood of erroneous results, but whether the likelihood of erroneous results in the hands of waived test users is negligible will vary from test to test depending on a number of factors. These factors include intended use, context of use (e.g., patient population, use environment), and the probable benefit(s) and probable risk(s)/harm(s) associated with waived use of the test. FDA intends for its approach to benefit-risk considerations to be consistent with the principles expressed, to the extent applicable, in FDA's other guidances.32 Accordingly, the appropriate acceptance criteria for the studies performed using the design options described above will vary from test to test. For example, for a qualitative test performed following study Options 1 or 2, the minimum level of agreement between results of the test in the hands of untrained and trained users for demonstrating comparable performance should generally be higher for a test for which erroneous results in waived settings are associated with a higher extent of probable patient risk/harm than for tests with lower probable risk/harm in waived settings.\n\nFootnote 31: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263a(d)(3)(A).\n\nFootnote 32: See, for example, \u201c_Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/benefit-risk-factors-consider-when-determining-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, and \u201c_Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/factors-consider-when-making-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approval-and-de.\n\nAppendix C General Study Design Considerations\n\nFor all study design options, FDA recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as closely as possible, actual CLIA-waived settings, patients, samples, and test operators. Therefore, study designs should include the following:\n\nTesting sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.\n\nSubject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).\n\nIntended sample type and matrix.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUntrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.\n\nTesting should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.\n\nTesting sites\n\nYou should conduct the study to support CLIA waiver at a minimum of three sites that are representative of both the intended use patient population and the intended operators in CLIA-waived settings. Generally, the sites should include different demographic and geographic locations (e.g., outpatient clinic, physician's office), since patient populations and intended operators typically vary among different demographic locations. In your CLIA waiver application, you should present a brief description of each site, including its name, address, and the date the study was performed. If there were sites that were included at the beginning, but then did not complete the study, you should provide a brief explanation for why those sites did not complete the study.\n\nFor study Options 1 and 2, trained operators may perform testing at the same sites as the untrained operators, or at a different laboratory site. For study Option 4, trained operators should perform testing with the comparative method at an appropriate laboratory site.\n\nOperators\n\nUntrained operators\n\nThe study should include 1-3 untrained operators at each site and at least nine (9) untrained operators across all sites. You should ensure that the untrained operator study participants enrolled represent anticipated operators of the device you propose for CLIA waiver. Untrained operators should have limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing and should not have previous training or experience with the candidate test, but may have limited experience with other waived or home use tests. Untrained operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties. We recommend that you record and tabulate the education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each untrained operator to demonstrate that these participants meet the definition of intended operators and include this in your CLIA waiver application. In addition, for each study site, we recommend you report the same information on other personnel that were available at the testing site but that were not chosen to participate.\n\nTrained operators\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.551686763763428", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 82: See section 564(e) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix E Quality System considerations\n\nFDA recognizes that there may be situations that raise unique compliance considerations, particularly regarding QS requirements. For example, non-traditional device manufacturers that previously operated under different quality standards or requirements may face challenges that take more time to address in transitioning to a system that fully complies with 21 CFR Part 820. FDA intends to take such considerations into account when making case-by-case compliance and enforcement decisions. Some manufacturers who intend to continue distributing their devices after the EUA termination date may choose to request an exemption or variance from a device QS requirement as outlined in 21 CFR 820.1(e) and section 520(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. Any such exemption or variance should be requested within 90 days of publication of the advance notice of termination of the EUA declaration pertaining to the device at issue to help ensure FDA considers your request in time.\n\nAppendix F Laboratory developed tests (LDTs)\n\nFor laboratory developed tests (LDTs)83 in general, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion, meaning that FDA generally does not exercise its authority to enforce the regulatory requirements for these devices, although it maintains that authority. FDA has not applied this general enforcement discretion approach to, among other LDTs, those used for declared emergencies under section 564 of the FD&C Act. As such, following termination of the EUAdeclaration for COVID-19 IVDs,84 FDA intends to have the same enforcement approach for COVID-19 LDTs as it does for other LDTs.\n\nFootnote 84: HHS declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 (issued February 4, 2020 (85 FR 7316) and amended March 15, 2023 (88 FR 16644)).\n\nVI Examples\n\nThe following hypotheticals are intended to illustrate the transition policy outlined above. To exemplify the timeline of the Transition Implementation Plan outlined in this section (Section VI. of this guidance), for purposes of the examples, FDA set the hypothetical advance notice of termination date for the EUA declaration pertaining to the device at issue as July 1 in Year 1, and the EUA termination date as January 1 in Year 2. This date is not intended to propose an actual advance notice of termination or EUA termination date; it is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Note that these generalized examples do not account for every possible detail, risk, or consideration a manufacturer should evaluate or that may be relevant to FDA decisions regarding a particular device.\n\nExample 1\n\nA single-use surgical mask that is intended for use in healthcare settings by healthcare personnel as personal protective equipment to provide a physical barrier to fluids and particulate materials was authorized for emergency use under an umbrella EUA for surgical masks.85 The manufacturer does not intend to continue distributing the surgical mask after the EUA is no longer in effect.\n\nFootnote 85: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-eaus/surgicalmasks.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. After July 1, the manufacturer continues to distribute the surgical masks and continues to comply with all conditions of authorization.\n\nOn the EUA termination date (January 1), the relevant EUA declaration is terminated and the umbrella EUA is no longer in effect. On January 1, the manufacturer ceases distribution of the surgical mask. Before January 1, the manufacturer had recently sold surgical masks directly to retailers and device distributors. Some of the surgical masks are in transit to these customers, and others are being held in device distributors' warehouses in the U.S.\n\nThe policies included in this guidance relate to the following actions by the device manufacturer and others:\n\nThe surgical masks in transit or in device distributors' warehouses remain distributed (they were already distributed by the EUA termination date), and they are used by the end user prior to their expiration date.\n\nIf on January 1, some of the surgical masks are in the manufacturer's possession, the surgical masks in the manufacturer's possession are not subsequently distributed (they were not already distributed by the EUA termination date).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe manufacturer does not update the labeling of the already distributed surgical masks (they are single-use, non-life-supporting/non-life-sustaining devices).\n\nUser exhaustion of already distributed surgical masks is described in Section V.C. of this guidance.\n\nEven after the cessation of distribution, the manufacturer continues to submit any adverse event reports of which it becomes aware to FDA consistent with 21 CFR Part 803.\n\nExample 2\n\nA continuous ventilator was authorized under the umbrella EUA for ventilators and ventilator accessories86 to support patients who develop respiratory distress due to COVID-19.\n\nFootnote 86: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/ventilators-and-ventilator-accessories-cua.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. Before August 1, to help FDA plan for transition-related premarket review activities, the manufacturer submits an \"EUA report\" to the CDRH Document Control Center with \"Attention: Notification of Intent\" on the cover letter of the submission to inform FDA that it does not intend to pursue marketing authorization. This EUA report includes the information outlined in Section V.A. of this guidance, which includes the manufacturer's plans to have already distributed ventilators remain distributed.\n\nOn the EUA termination date (January 1), the relevant EUA declaration is terminated and the umbrella EUA is no longer in effect. On January 1, the manufacturer ceases distribution of the ventilator. FDA does not intend to object if the manufacturer implements a plan (that was included in the Notification of Intent) for the already distributed ventilators to remain distributed (e.g., ventilators in device distributors' warehouses), including ventilators in the possession of end users (e.g., ventilators in healthcare facilities). As part of the plan, the manufacturer interacts with affected stakeholders, such as healthcare facilities, to determine the stakeholders' interest in keeping distributed ventilators. The ventilator manufacturer updates the electronic labeling as outlined in Section V.C. of this guidance, and emails a copy of the electronic labeling to affected stakeholders that have expressed an interest in keeping the ventilators.\n\nThe policies included in this guidance relate to the following actions by the device manufacturer and others:\n\nThe already distributed ventilators are not used.\n\nShould healthcare facilities wish to retain the ventilator that lacks FDA clearance, approval, or authorization for use in the future, the future use of the device would be subject to the regulatory requirements of any future authorization, including marketing authorization or EUA.\n\nFor governmental stockpilers that wish to retain a device that lacks requisite FDA clearance, approval, or authorization for use in the future, FDA recommends engaging with the Agency to discuss the public health need for future deployment and/or use of the device in specific circumstances (e.g., regional natural disaster, localized disease outbreaks).\n\nEven after the cessation of distribution, the manufacturer continues to submit any adverse event reports of which it becomes aware to FDA consistent with 21 CFR Part 803.\n\nExample 3\n\nA non-traditional device manufacturer worked with a traditional device manufacturer (original equipment manufacturer (OEM)) to produce, as a contract manufacturer, ventilators that were designed by the traditional device manufacturer. Such devices were authorized under the umbrella EUA for ventilators and ventilator accessories87 and distributed by the OEM during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFootnote 87: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/ventilators-and-ventilator-accessories-eus.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. Before August 1, to help FDA plan for transition-related premarket review activities, the OEM submits an \"EUA report\" to the CDRH Document Control Center with \"Attention: Notification of Intent\" on the cover letter of the submission to inform FDA that it intends to pursue marketing authorization. This EUA report includes the information outlined in Section V.A. of this guidance.\n\nOn October 1, the OEM submits a marketing submission to FDA. In its marketing submission, the OEM includes a \"Transition Implementation Plan\" for already distributed ventilators in the case of a positive decision as well as in the case of a negative decision on the marketing submission. On October 10, the marketing submission is determined to be administratively incomplete because it is missing a test report for a biocompatibility endpoint; the marketing submission is not accepted for review (an \"RTA1 decision\"). The OEM resolves the acceptance review deficiency by including the missing test report for the biocompatibility endpoint and resubmits the marketing submission on November 1.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA's regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as \"(b)(2)-dietary ingredients.\" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA's regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as \"the compliance requirements.\"\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA's Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.8760810494422913", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7397443056106567", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.5527578592300415", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement \"Not a significant source of ____\" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when \"circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply\" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, \"FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.\"\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the \"Not a significant source of ____\" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as \"Not a significant source of other nutrients\" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA's labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be \"packaged and sold individually,\" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement \"This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale\" or \"This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale\" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The \"principal display panel\" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The \"information panel\" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), \"Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber\"). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4794434905052185", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does \"levels of significance\" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement \"Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)\" or \"Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).\" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement \"Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)\" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8968890309333801", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Should sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n\nWe understand that manufacturers may use hydrolysis of starches and other complex carbohydrates in the production of some plant-based beverages for purposes other than to increase the sugar content and sweetness of the final product. For example, a manufacturer might use hydrolysis to reduce a product's viscosity (thickness). When we issued our proposed rule to amend the Nutrition Facts label requirements, some comments to the proposed rule said that we should exclude certain ingredients from the definition of added sugars because the ingredients are not added to the product for the intended purpose of sweetening. We responded that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we consider the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (81 FR 33742 at 33835). The sugars created in the production of plant-based beverages, as well as other ingredients and foods that undergo controlled hydrolysis, contribute empty calories to the diet.\n\nAdditionally, we said in our answer to question 14 above that when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as Added Sugars on the label.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor the Added Sugars declaration, we consider sugars created through the hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates inherent to grains, such as oats or rice, to be the same as sugars created through the hydrolysis of starch in the production of ingredients, such as maltodext, because in both cases, sugars are created through controlled hydrolysis. Because the hydrolysis process is controlled, manufacturers can determine the amount of sugars created and present in the final product.\n\n16. Does the sugar created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose in low-lactose dairy products need to be declared as added sugars?\n\nWe received several comments to the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels proposed rule related to lactose in dairy ingredients, which are summarized in Comment 209 of the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels final rule (the final rule) (81 FR 33742 at 33835). The sugars in dairy ingredients, except lactose as defined in 21 CFR 168.122, are not included in the definition of added sugars. Moreover, lactose that meets our standard of identity is an added sugar.\n\nLactose, as a sugar in a dairy product, is a disaccharide that is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under the Total Sugars declaration. However, lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122 is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under both the Added Sugars and Total Sugars declarations. We are aware that the enzyme lactase is used by industry to hydrolyze lactose present in dairy products for the purposes of reducing the lactose content in low-lactose dairy products. The hydrolysis of lactose results in the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. Regardless of whether hydrolysis of lactose, present in dairy products or in dairy ingredients by lactase is being utilized to reduce lactose or to increase the sweetness of the product, hydrolysis of lactose under such circumstances does not result in an increase in sugars that would affect the Total Sugars declaration. Moreover, to the extent lactose that meets our standard of identity in 21 CFR 168.122 is subject to hydrolysis, the Added Sugars declaration would be the same before and after the hydrolysis of such a lactose ingredient using lactase. Since the hydrolysis of lactose found in dairy products (e.g. milk) and dairy ingredients (e.g. stabilizers and texturizers), and the hydrolysis of lactose that meets our standard of identity, do not result in an increase in the Total Sugars declaration, the hydrolysis process also does not result in an increase in the caloric content of the food. Thus, the sugars created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose, whether present as a component of a dairy product, a dairy ingredient, or contributed by the addition of lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122, do not change the declarations for Total Sugars or Added Sugars for the product.\n\nIf sugars are added to a food that already contains inherent sugars (e.g. yogurt), does that make \"added sugars\" a Class I nutrient for purposes of compliance under 21 CFR 101.9(g)? If so, does that mean that the composite must be formulated to be at least equal to the value for the added nutrient (added sugars) declared on the label per 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i), or is 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) allowing up to 20% in excess of the value declared applicable?\n\nAdded sugars would be a nutrient in a fortified or fabricated food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)). Added sugars is not a nutrient listed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i). The nutrients listed in this regulation include: vitamins, minerals, protein, and dietary fiber.\n\nWhen a food contains sugars that are endogenous and not exogenous sugars, the nutrient content of the composite for \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" would be subject to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Section 101.9(g)(5) requires that the nutrient content of the composite be no greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label and states that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.\n\nHowever, because there are no generally recognized analytical methods available to quantify added sugars in a food when the food contains sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, the parenthetical after \"added sugars\" in SS 101.9(g)(5) states that, \"when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars.\" The parenthetical is intended to clarify that the requirement in SS 101.9(g)(5) for the added sugars declaration would only apply when there is an analytical method available to quantify the added sugars. When a food contains a combination of sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, we would verify the declaration of added sugars in a food using the records required by SS 101.9(g)(10) and (11).\n\nWith respect to the total sugars declaration, SS 101.9(g)(5) would apply whether the food contains only added sugars, only sugars that do not meet our definition of added sugars, or a combination of these sugars in a food because there would be an analytical method to quantify \"Total Sugars\" under any of these circumstances.\n\nA food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)).

These could be modified by other factors such as A through F above.\n\nExamples of ECG monitoring in late stage:\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,4 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapetic dose (relative to phase 3 dose) shows mean QTc effects between 10 and 20 ms. If there is reasonable assurance that the higher dose represents drug exposures that are unlikely to be seen in the patient population, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. This approach provides reassurance for safety because patients are unlikely to experience a clinically significant QTc effect. Footnote 4: A negative study, as defined by the ICH E14 guidance criteria, is an upper one-sided 95% CI of QTc prolongation effect (<10) ms.\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a positive finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,5 at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation (<20) ms. For drugs with this magnitude of effect on the QTc interval, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is called for. Footnote 5: Ibid.\n\nIntensive ECG monitoring in clinical trials has two main objectives. One objective is to provide protection to patients who might have large, worrisome QT intervals (>500) ms. A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late-stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency. Other than descriptive statistics, detailed statistical analysis is not expected. This monitoring is intended to be performed locally, without the involvement of a central core laboratory.\n\nThe timing of ECG collection should be based on the known properties of the drug. All patients should receive baseline, steady-state, and periodic ECGs during the trial. In addition, ECGs should be collected around T({}{\\text{max}}) at the first dose and/or around steady state in a subgroup of patients or in dedicated studies. ECG collection at around T({}{\\text{max}}) is not important for drugs with low fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations. If the drug shows a delayed effect in QT prolongation, then the timing of ECG collection should reflect this delay.\n3. The thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,6 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms. If supratherapeutic exposure is anticipated at the clinical dose only in a well-characterized subgroup, intensive monitoring as described in Example 2 above could be carried out in this subset of the phase 3 population. In this case, there should be reasonable assurance that the higher exposure is unlikely to be seen in the general patient population. In contrast, if people in the general patient population (who cannot be readily identified in advance) will in some cases achieve this higher exposure, intensive ECG monitoring in the phase 3 population is expected, as in Example 2. Footnote 6: Ibid.\n4. The therapeutic dose results in a mean QTc prolongation of (>20) ms. For drugs with large QTc prolongation effects, intensive ECG assessment would be appropriate in all patients in phase 2/3. Because of the risk of TdP, another important use of ECG monitoring in late phase trials would be to assess any risk mitigation strategies (e.g., electrolyte monitoring, dose reduction strategies). Additional ECG assessment over and above what is recommended earlier in this question and answer might also be called for (e.g., 24-hour ECG recording, telemetry, multiple trough ECGs through steady state).\n\nThe sponsor is encouraged to discuss these approaches with the relevant regulatory agency or agencies prior to initiation of the phase 3 program.\n\nS7b Questions and Answers\n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment (1)\n\nQ17. What is the general strategy for use of nonclinical information as part of an integrated risk assessment for delayed ventricular repolarization and torsade de pointes that can inform the design of clinical investigations and interpretation of their results? (1.1)\n\nThe ICH S7B guidance describes a nonclinical strategy for assessing risk of delayed ventricular repolarization and QT interval prolongation (section II.C (2.3)). A mechanistic understanding of the development of torsade de pointes (TdP) and the emergence of new types of assays have made it possible to obtain more information to assess TdP risk from nonclinical assays.\n\nThe in vitro IKr/hERG assay and in vivo QT assay as well as optional follow-up studies, as described in the ICH S7B guidance, are conducted for hazard identification and risk assessment relevant to delayed ventricular repolarization. It is generally accepted that drugs (note that the word \"drug(s)\" in the S7B Q&As is used interchangeably with word \"pharmaceutical(s)\" in the ICH S7B guidance) that delay ventricular repolarization may have increased risk of TdP.\n\nIn addition to supporting the planning and interpretation of First-in-Human clinical studies, nonclinical investigations can also contribute to an integrated risk assessment for TdP in later stages of development when clinical data are available. The following are points to consider when using in vitro IKr/hERG data and in vivo QT data in combination with clinical QT data as part of an integrated risk assessment for situations described in ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) and Q13 (6.1).\n\nTo predict whether or not the hERG block poses a risk of interfering with ventricular repolarization or TdP, evaluation of the hERG safety margin based on results of a best practice assay (see S7B Q&As Q18 (1.2) and Q19 (2.1)) is recommended. ICH S7A guidance, section II.F (2.6) describes considerations for when human metabolite(s) should be assessed with in vitro systems. In these cases, the metabolite's hERG safety margin should also be evaluated.\n\nIn the in vivo study, the effects on the QTc interval should be assessed at exposures that cover the anticipated high clinical exposure scenario. The adequacy of exposure to any major human metabolites should be determined (see ICH S7A guidance, sections II.C.3.b (2.3.3.2) and II.F (2.6), and S7B Q&A Q28 (3.5)). In addition, if the assay is to be used as part of an integrated clinical and nonclinical risk assessment for situations where a conventional thorough QT study is not feasible as described in ICH E14 Q&A Q13 (6.1), the in vivo study should have sufficient sensitivity to detect a QTc prolongation effect of a magnitude similar to dedicated clinical QT studies (see ICH S7B Q&A Q27 (3.4)). This additional consideration (sensitivity similar to dedicated clinical QT studies) does not apply to decision-making prior to First-in-Human studies or under ICH E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1).\n\nA drug with low TdP risk would be expected to have (1) a hERG safety margin higher than a threshold defined based on the safety margins computed under the same experimental protocol for a series of drugs known to cause TdP (see ICH S7B Q&A Q18 (1.2) for additional details); and (2) no QTc prolongation in an in vivo assay of sufficient sensitivity conducted at exposures of parent compound and major human metabolites that exceed clinical exposures. See ICH S7A guidance, section II.F (2.6) for considerations of human metabolite(s) in the in vitro or in vivo nonclinical assays. If these results are used to support an integrated clinical and nonclinical risk assessment strategy as described in ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) and Q13 (6.1), no additional nonclinical studies are needed. When there are factors that can confound or limit the interpretation of the nonclinical studies, such as metabolites and heart rate changes, follow-up studies as described in the ICH S7B guidance (section II.C.5 (2.3.5)) can be performed to address these specific issues.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the hERG assay and/or the in vivo QT study suggest an effect at clinical exposures, the drug has a risk of interfering with ventricular repolarization. Under this scenario, the drug's TdP risk could be affected by various other factors, such as blocking of additional repolarization currents (e.g., slow delayed rectifier potassium current [Iks]), blocking of inward currents (e.g., sodium and L-type calcium currents), effects on the trafficking of ion channel proteins from cytoplasmic sites to the surface membrane, metabolites with ion channel activities, and non-ion channel mediated QT prolongation. Follow-up studies (ICH S7B guidance, section II.C.5 (2.3.5)) could be performed to further explore the mechanisms and assess the TdP risk. If applicable, best practice considerations should be followed for assessment of additional ion channel currents (S7B Q&A Q19 (2.1)), in vitro cardiomyocyte assays (S7B Q&As Q20 (2.2) to Q23 (2.5)), or in vivo studies (S7B Q&As Q24 (3.1) to Q28 (3.5)). An appropriately qualified proarrhythmia risk prediction model (see S7B Q&As Q29 (4.1) to Q30 (4.2)) could be used according to its context of use to assess the possibility of TdP in humans. Use of in vitro and in silico models can reduce animal use in follow-up studies in accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles. The assessment of TdP risk using these follow-up studies, although optional, can be used together with other relevant nonclinical and clinical information to contribute to the design of subsequent clinical investigations and interpretation of their results.\n\n4.2.3 What is the recommended method to compute the hERG safety margin?

(7.1)\n\nClarification of approach to evaluating QTc in late stage clinical development\n\nThe purpose of a thorough QT study is to characterize the effect of the drug on ventricular repolarization (QT interval). It is not the purpose of the thorough QT study to assess the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in the target population, but rather to determine whether further data are warranted to assess risk. A finding of QT prolongation above the regulatory threshold of interest (a positive thorough QT study) might call for further electrocardiographic follow-up in late phase studies. The extent of the follow-up would be affected by the magnitude of the estimated prolongation at doses and concentrations at which this occurs. If prolongation is substantial at concentrations expected to occur in clinical studies, it is important to protect patients in later trials and to obtain further information on the frequency of marked QT prolongation. In some cases in which there is a large margin of safety between therapeutic exposures and the exposures that result in significant ECG interval changes, an intensive ECG follow-up strategy might not be warranted.\n\nThe recommended intensity of the monitoring and assessment in late-stage trials will depend on:\n\nThe magnitude of QTc prolongation seen in the thorough QT study or early clinical studies\n\nThe circumstances in which substantial QT prolongation might occur (i.e., in ordinary use or only when drug concentrations are markedly increased (e.g., by renal or hepatic impairment, concomitant medications))\n\nPK properties of the drug (e.g., high inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations, metabolites)\n\nCharacteristics of the target patient population that would increase the proarrhythmic risk (e.g., structural heart disease)\n\nThe presence of adverse effects that can increase proarrhythmic risk (e.g., hypokalemia, bradycardia, heart block)\n\nOther characteristics of the drug (e.g., pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, toxicology, drug class, hysteresis)\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe following examples delineate the scope of recommended ECG investigations based on outcome of the thorough QT study or early clinical studies. These could be modified by other factors such as A through F above.\n\n4.2.3 Examples of ECG monitoring in late stage:\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,2 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose (relative to phase 3 dose) shows mean QTc effects between 10 and 20 ms. If there is reasonable assurance that the higher dose represents drug exposures that are unlikely to be seen in the patient population, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. This approach provides reassurance for safety because patients are unlikely to experience a clinically significant QTc effect.\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a positive finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,3 at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation (<20) ms. For drugs with this magnitude of effect on the QTc interval, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is called for. Footnote 2: A negative study, as defined by the ICH E14 criteria, is an upper one-sided 95% CI of QTc prolongation effect (<10) ms.\n\nIntensive ECG monitoring in clinical trials has two main objectives. One objective is to provide protection to patients who might have large worrisome QT intervals (>500) ms. A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency. Other than descriptive statistics, detailed statistical analysis is not expected. This monitoring is intended to be performed locally, without the involvement of a central core laboratory.\n\nThe timing of ECG collection should be based on the known properties of the drug. All patients should receive baseline, steady-state, and periodic ECGs during the trial. In addition, ECGs should be collected around T({}{\\text{max}}) at the first dose and/or around steady state in a subgroup of patients or in dedicated studies. ECG collection at around T({}{\\text{max}}) is not important for drugs with low fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations. If the drug shows a delayed effect in QT prolongation, then the timing of ECG collection should reflect this delay.\n3. The thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,4 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms. If supratherapeutic exposure is anticipated at the clinical dose only in a well-characterized subgroup, intensive monitoring as described in Example 2 above could becarried out in this subset of the phase 3 population. In this case, there should be reasonable assurance that the higher exposure is unlikely to be seen in the general patient population. In contrast, if people in the general patient population (who cannot be readily identified in advance) will in some cases achieve this higher exposure, intensive ECG monitoring in the phase 3 population is expected, as in Example 2.\n4. The therapeutic dose results in a mean QTc prolongation of (>20) ms. For drugs with large QTc prolongation effects, intensive ECG assessment would be appropriate in all patients in phase 2/3. Because of the risk of TdP, another important use of ECG monitoring in late phase trials would be to assess any risk mitigation strategies (e.g., electrolyte monitoring, dose reduction strategies).

While increases in QT/QTc to >500 ms or of >60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds forpotential discontinuation, the exact criteria chosen for a given trial will depend on the risk-tolerance level considered appropriate for the indication and patient group in question.\n\nThe Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms. The study is typically carried out in healthy volunteers (as opposed to individuals at increased risk of arrhythmias) and is used to determine whether or not the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc interval in target patient populations should be studied intensively during later stages of drug development. It is not intended to identify drugs as being pro-arrhythmic. Although data are limited, it is not expected that the results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' would be affected by ethnic factors.\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' would typically be conducted early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials, although the precise timing will depend on the specifics of the drug under development. It would usually not be the first study, as it is important to have basic clinical data for its design and conduct, including tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Some drugs might not be suitable for study in healthy volunteers because of issues related to tolerability (e.g., neuroleptic agents, chemotherapeutics).\n\nThe results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' will influence the amount of information collected in later stages of development:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.0463277101516724", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.5 Alternative Strategies to Assess QT/QTc Interval Effects\n\nAlternatives to the use of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' are under active investigation. Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, additional evaluation in subsequent clinical studies should be performed. One objective of this evaluation should be to fully describe the effect of the drug on the QT/QTc interval in the target patient population with particular attention to dose- and concentration-related effects. It is important to include patients in these analyses exposed to the full range of potential doses and patients with additional risk factors for TdP. These analyses would ordinarily focus on outliers as well as on changes in mean QT/QTc. Depending on the size of the effect seen in the 'thorough QT/QTc study', more intense monitoring of patients with additional risk factors for TdP might be needed.\n\nWhile what constitutes adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this is not fully established, additional ECGs collected appropriately in substantial numbers of patients in late phase clinical trials could provide this information. In this case, it would be important to collect ECGs at the anticipated time of peak drug effects, as determined in the 'thorough QT/QTc study' and pharmacokinetic information about the patient population.\n\nAnother objective of this evaluation should be to collect information on the adverse events that occur in the trials following the positive 'thorough QT/QTc study'. This would include patients who develop marked QT/QTc prolongation (e.g., >500 ms) or experience a serious cardiovascular adverse event that suggests an arrhythmia (e.g., TdP). Such patients should be evaluated closely for risk factors that might have contributed to this event (e.g., genotyping for Long QT Syndromes, see section 4.3).\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, analyses of the ECG and adverse event data from certain patient sub-groups are of particular interest, such as:\n\nPatients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia);\n\nPatients with congestive heart failure;\n\nPatients with impaired drug metabolizing capacity or clearance (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions);\n\nFemale patients;\n\nPatients aged <16 and over 65 years.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6077156066894531", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.3 Timing of ECGs in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe timing of the collection of ECGs and the study design (e.g., single or multiple dose, duration) of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' should be guided by the available information about the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. For drugs with short half-lives and no metabolites, a single dose study might be sufficient. Studies should characterize the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc throughout the dosing interval. While the peak serum concentration does not always correspond to the peak effect on QT/QTc interval, care should be taken to perform ECG recordings at time points around the Cmax. As one intent of a positive control is to establish assay sensitivity, in multiple dose studies of new drugs a positive control needs to be used only long enough to have its expected effect.\n\n2.2.4 Interpretation of the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIt is difficult to determine whether there is an effect on the mean QT/QTc interval that is so small as to be of no consequence. However, drugs that prolong the mean QT/QTc interval by around 5 ms or less do not appear to cause TdP. On that basis, the positive control (whether pharmacological or non-pharmacogical) should be well-characterized and consistently produce an effect on the QT/QTc interval that is around the threshold of regulatory concern (5 ms, section 2.2).\n\nBased on similar considerations, a negative 'thorough QT/QTc study' is one in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 ms. This definition is chosen to provide reasonable assurance that the mean effect of the study drug on the QT/QTc interval is not greater than around 5 ms. When the largest time-matched difference exceeds the threshold, the study is termed 'positive'. A positive study influences the evaluations carried out during later stages of drug development, but does not imply that the drug is pro-arrhythmic.\n\nAs with other data, the presence of outliers (see section 3.2.2) should also be explored.\n\n2.2.5 Alternative Strategies to Assess QT/QTc Interval Effects\n\nAlternatives to the use of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' are under active investigation. Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3640232980251312"], "Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)?

By harmonizing the regulatory expectations in regions around the world, ICH guidelines have substantially reduced duplicative clinical studies, prevented unnecessary animal studies, standardized safety reporting and marketing application submissions, and contributed to many other improvements in the quality of global drug development and manufacturing and the products available to patients.\n\nICH is a consensus-driven process that involves technical experts from regulatory authorities and industry parties in detailed technical and science-based harmonization work that results in the development of ICH guidelines. The commitment to consistent adoption of these consensus-based guidelines by regulators around the globe is critical to realizing the benefits of safe, effective, and high-quality medicines for patients as well as for industry. As a Founding Regulatory Member of ICH, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays a major role in the development of each of the ICH guidelines, which FDA then adopts and issues as guidance to industry.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

This document has been endorsed by the ICH Assembly at Step 4 of the ICH process, April 2023. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the ICH regions.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction (1)2\n\nFootnote 2: The numbers in parentheses reflect the organizational breakdown of the document endorsed by the ICH Assembly at Step 4 of the ICH process, April 2023.\n\nThe synthesis of drug substances involves the use of reactive chemicals, reagents, solvents, catalysts, and other processing aids. As a result of chemical synthesis or subsequent degradation, impurities reside in all drug substances and associated drug products. Although the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidances for industry Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances (Revision 2) (ICH Q3A) (June 2008) and Q3B(R2) Impurities in New Drug Products (ICH Q3B(R2)) (August 2006) (Reference (Ref.) 1, 2) provide guidance for qualification and control for the majority of the impurities,3 limited guidance is provided for those impurities that are DNA reactive. The purpose of this guidance is to provide a practical framework that is applicable to the identification, categorization, qualification, and control of these mutagenic impurities to limit potential carcinogenic risk. This guidance is intended to complement ICH Q3A, ICH Q3B(R2) (Note 1), and the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorizations for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010) (Ref. 3).\n\nFootnote 3: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nThis guidance emphasizes considerations of both safety and quality risk management in establishing levels of mutagenic impurities that are expected to pose negligible carcinogenic risk. It outlines recommendations for assessment and control of mutagenic impurities that reside or are reasonably expected to reside in final drug substance or product, taking into consideration the intended conditions of human use.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. Theuse of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for new drug substances and new drug products during their clinical development and subsequent applications for marketing. It also applies to postapproval submissions of marketed products, and to new marketing applications for products with a drug substance that is present in a previously approved product, in both cases only where:\n\nChanges to the drug substance synthesis result in new impurities or increased acceptance criteria for existing impurities\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.0329205989837646", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In the context of ICH M7(R2), (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are considered an appropriate initial evaluation of mutagenic potential of an impurity at a daily dose of less than or equal to 1 mg. When a structural alert is identified, a follow-up in vitro evaluation (e.g., bacterial reverse mutation assay) could be conducted, or the impurity could be controlled by threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). Negative results in either evaluation would classify the impurity under Class 5. The result of the bacterial reverse mutation assay overrules the (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nAdditionally, impurities should not be assigned to Class 5 based solely on the absence of structural alerts by visual evaluation alone. There is an expectation that structural alert assessment will be conducted using (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nQ3. What are the expectations for evaluation of the genotoxic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity exceeds 1 mg daily dose? (1.3)\n\nIn the context of Note 1 of ICH M7(R2), 1 mg refers to an absolute amount of an impurity, irrespective of the identification or qualification thresholds outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B(R2).\n\nIn cases where the amount of impurity is less than 1 mg daily dose for chronic administration, and an impurity generated negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems, a minimum screen of genotoxicity studies (point mutation and chromosomal aberration) could be considered.\n\nQ4.: If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg daily dose, is further genetic toxicity testing warranted? (1.4)\n\nNo. If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg/day, further genetic toxicity testing is not warranted.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nQ5.: Are semisynthetic drug substances and drug products included in the scope of ICH M7(R2)? (2.1)\n\nYes, for certain cases. If a semisynthetic drug substance, as defined in the ICH guidance for industry Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances (November 2012), is manufactured using steps that could introduce mutagenic impurities or degradation products (e.g., postmodification of a fermentation product, late-stage introduction of a linker), a risk assessment is warranted.\n\nThe following compounds used in the manufacturing process of semisynthetic drug substances and drug products should be considered within the scope of the application of ICH M7(R2):\n\nChemically synthesized intermediates and actual impurities therein\n\nReagents\n\nIII GENERAL PRINCIPLES (3)\n\nQ6.: Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n\nNo. Carcinogens that are negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay do not have a DNA reactive mechanism of carcinogenicity and, therefore, are not in the scope of ICH M7(R2) (e.g., acetamide, hydroxylamine).\n\nQ7.: Should mutagenic, noncarcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.2)\n\nNo. Mutagens that are demonstrated to be noncarcinogenic in appropriate and well-conducted animal bioassays will be classified as Class 5 impurities.\n\nIV Considerations for Marketed Products (4)\n\nWhat does \"significant increase in clinical dose\" mean in section IV.C., Changes to the Clinical Use of the Marketed Products, (4.3)? (4.1)\n\nAny increase in dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that would increase any mutagenic impurity to levels above the acceptable limits is considered significant (see Tables 2 and 3 in ICH M7(R2) and the ICH guidance for industry M7(R2) Addendum: Application of the Principles of the ICH M7 Guidance to Calculation of Compound-Specific Acceptable Intakes (July 2023)).\n\nIn such cases a reevaluation of the mutagenic impurity limits is recommended.\n\nV DRUG SUBSTANCE AND DRUG PRODUT IMPURITY ASSESSMENT (5)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section. (5.1)\n\nVI HAZARD ASSESSMENT ELEMENTS (6)\n\nWhat information and/or documentation should be provided to regulatory agencies to sufficiently demonstrate validation of (Q)SAR models that are developed in-house or are not commonly used? (6.1)\n\nSection VI (6) of ICH M7(R2) states that \"(Q)SAR models utilizing these prediction methodologies should follow the general validation principles set forth by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\" (OECD Validation 2007).\n\nIn the context of ICH M7(R2), the OECD principles of (Q)SAR validation are:\n\nA defined endpoint -- The model should be trained using experimental data generated according to the standard OECD protocol for the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay.\n\nAn unambiguous algorithm -- The algorithm used to construct the model should be disclosed. It should be clear whether the model is considered statistical (constructed via machine learning) or expert rule based (created from human expert-derived knowledge).\n\nA defined domain of applicability -- It should be described whether a test chemical falls within the model's applicability domain and how the applicability domain is calculated. The user should be warned when the model does not have enough information to make a reliable prediction on a chemical.\n\nAppropriate measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness, and predictivity -- The model should be evaluated and shown to be sufficiently predictive of bacterial reverse mutagenicity. Standard validation techniques that should be used are recall, crossvalidation, and external validation. Evidence that the model has not been over-fit should also be provided.\n\nA mechanistic interpretation -- Is there adequate information to allow an assessment of mechanistic relevance to be made (e.g., specific descriptors)?\n\nFor any system as a minimum recommendation to demonstrate how each model follows these principles and to understand how a (Q)SAR model was developed and validated, the sponsor is expected to provide the OECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) (OECD QMRF 2017) on request by the regulatory agency. This template summarizes and reports key information on (Q)SAR models, including the results of any validation studies as well as provides supplementary information on applicability of the model to a given chemical. Agencies may request this information depending on the experience of the specific agency with the specific models.\n\nQ11. When an out-of-domain or noncoverage result is obtained from one of the two (Q)SAR models as described in ICH M7(R2), can the impurity be classified as a Class 5 impurity? (6.2)\n\nNo, an out-of-domain or noncoverage result from one of the two (Q)SAR models warrants additional assessment to classify the compound as a Class 5 impurity.\n\nGiven that the relationship between chemical structure and DNA reactivity is well understood, it is unlikely that a structure with mutagenic potential would be associated with an out-of-domain result. However, expert review can provide reassurance in assignment of such impurities to Class 5.\n\nExpert review may include one or a combination of the following (Amberg et. al. 2019):\n\nComparison to structurally similar analogs for which bacterial reverse mutation assay data are available (read-across approach).\n\nExpert review of the chemical structure to determine if there is potential for the chemical to react with DNA.\n\n(Q)SAR output from an additional validated model (see Question Q10 (6.1)) of the same methodology (i.e., expert rule based or statistical) that generates a prediction that is within its applicability domain.\n\nIn a case where an impurity is demonstrated to be negative in an Ames test but positive in a clastogenicity study (e.g., chromosomal aberration test), how would the impurity be classified per ICH M7(R2) classification system? (6.3)\n\nIf an impurity tests negative in an Ames assay, it is considered a Class 5 impurity. Addressing positive results in a clastogenicity assay is out of the scope of ICH M7(R2).\n\nPlease clarify the rationale for the tests included under Note 3 as a follow-up to investigate the in vivo relevance of in vitro mutagens. (6.4)\n\nIf an impurity is positive in the Ames test, and levels of the impurity cannot be controlled to an appropriate acceptable limit, an in vivo follow-up test with mutagenic endpoint (mutagenicity) should be used. The other follow-up tests outlined in Note 3 are also acceptable when scientific rationale (as indicated in Note 3) is provided to support their uses.\n\nFor any of the above tests, adequate exposure should be demonstrated in line with the ICH guidance for industry S2(R1) Genotoxicity Testing and Data Interpretation for Pharmaceuticals Intended for Human Use (June 2012).\n\nVII Risk Characterization (7)\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are negative, is that sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance? (7.1)\n\nYes. A well-conducted and scientifically justified in vivo study (see Question Q13 (6.4) in this document) is sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance. If the results of the in vivo study are negative, the impurity can be assigned to ICH M7(R2) Class 5.\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity cannot be controlled to an acceptable limit and is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are positive, does that support setting compound-specific impurity limits? (7.2)\n\nWhen a mutagenic impurity cannot be controlled to the TTC (or less than lifetime (LTL) based limit), results from an appropriate in vivo assay could complement the available data for a weight of evidence approach to support a higher limit on a case-by-case basis. However, in vivo gene mutation assays alone are currently not validated to directly assess cancer risk because the endpoint is mutation and not carcinogenicity (i.e., they are used for hazard identification).\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6767759323120117", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The approaches outlined in this Q&A are consistent with the principles in ICH M7 concerning hazard assessment, risk characterisation of mutagenic impurities, and their control. However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n\n[5.10] Do all steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish people- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in Section 3.2.S.2.2. Similarly, the general principles do not include a reaction- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in the process description in Section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application?\n\n[5.11] ICH Q11 states that \"enough of the drug substance 3.2.S.2.2 of the application, the following considerations should be applied.\n\n[5.12] The applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process should be described in the application.....\" 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\n[5.13] What considerations should an applicent apply in the selection of the proposed starting materials to assure that enough of the drug substance substance\n\n[5.14] The applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process should be described in the application.....\" 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\n[5.15] Next, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in Section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n\n[5.16] They need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\n[5.17] They include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6391323804855347", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)?

By harmonizing the regulatory expectations in regions around the world, ICH guidelines have substantially reduced duplicative clinical studies, prevented unnecessary animal studies, standardized safety reporting and marketing application submissions, and contributed to many other improvements in the quality of global drug development and manufacturing and the products available to patients.\n\nICH is a consensus-driven process that involves technical experts from regulatory authorities and industry parties in detailed technical and science-based harmonization work that results in the development of ICH guidelines. The commitment to consistent adoption of these consensus-based guidelines by regulators around the globe is critical to realizing the benefits of safe, effective, and high-quality medicines for patients as well as for industry. As a Founding Regulatory Member of ICH, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays a major role in the development of each of the ICH guidelines, which FDA then adopts and issues as guidance to industry.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPREFACE................................................................................................................................................................................................ 1\n\nI.

This document has been endorsed by the ICH Assembly at Step 4 of the ICH process, May 2022.

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nPreface\n\nSince the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry M7 Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals to Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk (ICH M7) was finalized, worldwide experience with implementation of the recommendations for DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities has given rise to requests for clarification relating to the assessment and control of DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities.\n\nThis question and answer (Q&A) document is intended to provide additional clarification and to promote convergence and improve harmonization of the considerations for assessment and control of DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities and of the information that should be provided during drug development, marketing authorization applications, and/or master files submissions.\n\nThe scope of this Q&A document follows that of the ICH guidance for industry M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals to Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk (ICH M7(R2)) (July 2023).2\n\nFootnote 2: We update guidances periodically.

Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nNo. The terms mutagenic potential and genotoxic potential are not interchangeable. Mutagenic potential refers to the ability of a compound to induce point mutations (i.e., bacterial reverse mutation assay), and genotoxic potential refers to mutagenic, clastogenic, or aneugenic potential. ICH M7(R2) focuses specifically on mutagenicity.\n\nQ2. What are the expectations for evaluation of the mutagenic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity is less than or equal to 1 milligram (mg) daily dose? (1.2)\n\nIn the context of ICH M7(R2), (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are considered an appropriate initial evaluation of mutagenic potential of an impurity at a daily dose of less than or equal to 1 mg. When a structural alert is identified, a follow-up in vitro evaluation (e.g., bacterial reverse mutation assay) could be conducted, or the impurity could be controlled by threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). Negative results in either evaluation would classify the impurity under Class 5. The result of the bacterial reverse mutation assay overrules the (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nAdditionally, impurities should not be assigned to Class 5 based solely on the absence of structural alerts by visual evaluation alone. There is an expectation that structural alert assessment will be conducted using (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nQ3. What are the expectations for evaluation of the genotoxic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity exceeds 1 mg daily dose? (1.3)\n\nIn the context of Note 1 of ICH M7(R2), 1 mg refers to an absolute amount of an impurity, irrespective of the identification or qualification thresholds outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B(R2).\n\nIn cases where the amount of impurity is less than 1 mg daily dose for chronic administration, and an impurity generated negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems, a minimum screen of genotoxicity studies (point mutation and chromosomal aberration) could be considered.\n\nQ4.: If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg daily dose, is further genetic toxicity testing warranted? (1.4)\n\nNo. If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg/day, further genetic toxicity testing is not warranted.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nQ5.: Are semisynthetic drug substances and drug products included in the scope of ICH M7(R2)?

This guidance represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on modified release solid oral dosage forms scale-up and postapproval changes. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirement of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nSUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes:\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls;\n\nIn Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to pharmaceutical sponsors of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and abbreviated antibiotic drug applications (AADAs) who intend to change (1) the components or composition, (2) the site of manufacture, (3) the scale-up/scale-down of manufacture, and/or (4) the manufacturing (process and equipment) of a modified release solid oral dosage form during the postapproval period.\n\nThe guidance defines (1) levels of change, (2) recommended chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) tests for each level of change, (3) recommended in vitro dissolution tests and/or in vivo bioequivalence tests for each level of change; and (4) documentation that should support the change. This guidance specifies application information that should be provided to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to ensure continuing product quality and performance characteristics of a modified release solid oral dose formulation for specified postapproval changes.\n\nThis guidance does not comment on or otherwise affect compliance/inspection documentation that has been defined by CDER's Office of Compliance or FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs. This guidance does not affect any postapproval changes other than the ones specified. For those changes filed in a Changes Being Effected (CBE) supplement (21 CFR 314.70(c)), the FDA may, after a review of the supplemental information, decide that the changes are not approvable. For changes not addressed in this guidance, or for multiple changes submitted at one time or over a short period of time, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division or consult other CDER guidances to obtain information about tests and application documentation.\n\nFDA regulations at 21 CFR 314.70(a) provide that applicants may make changes to an approved application in accordance with a guidance, notice, or regulation published in the Federal Register that provides for a less burdensome notification of the change (for example, by notification at the time a supplement is submitted or in the next annual report). This guidance permits less burdensome notice of certain postapproval changes within the meaning of SS 314.70(a).\n\nFor postapproval changes for modified release solid oral dosage forms that affect components and composition, scale-up/scale-down, site change, and manufacturing process or equipment changes, this guidance supersedes the recommendations in section 4.G of the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) Policy and Procedure Guide 22-90 (September 11, 1990). For all other dosage forms and changes, this guidance does not affect the recommendations in Guide 22-90.\n\nII General stability considerations\n\nThe effect SUPAC-type changes have on the stability of the drug product should be evaluated. For general guidance on conducting stability studies, applicants are referred to the FDA Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics (02/87). For SUPAC submissions, the following points also should be considered:\n\nIn most cases (except those involving scale up), stability data from pilot scale batches will be acceptable to support the proposed change.\n\nWhere stability data show a trend toward potency loss or degradant increase under accelerated conditions, it is recommended that historical accelerated stability data from a representative prechange batch be submitted for comparison. It is also recommended that under these circumstances, all available long-term data on test batches from ongoing studies be provided in the supplement. Submission of historical accelerated and available long-term data would facilitate review and approval of the supplement.\n\nA commitment should be included to conduct long-term stability studies through the expiration dating period, according to the approved protocol, on the first or first three (see text for details) production batches and to report the results in the annual reports.\n\nIII Components and composition -- nonrelease controlling excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in nonrelease controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether the excipient is critical or not critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications for claiming any excipient(s) as a nonrelease controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes in components or composition that have the effect of adding a new excipient or deleting an excipient are defined at level 3 (defined below), except as described below in Section III.A.1.a. Waiver of bioequivalence testing for a change in composition which involves only a different color, flavor or preservative may be permissible as described in 21 CFR 320.22(d)(4).\n\nA.: Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExamples:\n\nDeletion or partial deletion of an ingredient intended to affect the color or flavor of the drug product; or change in the ingredient of the printing ink to another approved ingredient.\n\nChanges in nonrelease controlling excipients, expressed as percentage (w/w) of total formulation, less than or equal to the following percent ranges:\n\nFiller (\\pm)5\n\nDisintegrant (\\pm)3\n\nStarch Other (\\pm)1\n\nBinder (\\pm)0.5\n\nLubricant Ca or Mg Stearate (\\pm)0.25\n\nOther (\\pm)1\n\nGlidant\n\nTalc (\\pm)1\n\nOther (\\pm)0.1\n\nFilm Coat (\\pm)1\n\nThese percentages are based on the assumption that the drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all nonrelease controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5%.2 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the original approved application range.\n\nFootnote 2: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate, the lactose and microcrystalline cellulose should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% (e.g., lactose increases by 2.5% and microcrystalline cellulose decreases by 2.5%) relative to the target dosage form weight if it is to stay within the level 1 range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the drug product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na.

Level 2 Change\n\nDefinition of Level Changes in batch size beyond a factor of ten times the size of the pilot/biobatch where (1) the equipment used to produce the test batch(es) is of the same design and operating principles; (2) the batch(es) is manufactured in full compliance with cGMPs; and (3) the same SOPs and controls as well as the same formulation and manufacturing procedures are used on the test batch(es) and on the full-scale production batch(es).\n\nTest Documentation\n\nChemistry documentation Application/compential product release requirements.\n\nNotification of change and submission of updated batch records.\n\nStability: One batch with three months' accelerated stability data reported in Changes Being Effected supplement and long-term stability data of first production batch reported in annual report.\n\nDissolution documentation Extended release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained in three other media, for example, in water, 0.1N HCl, and USP buffer media at pH 4.5, and 6.8 for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours, and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, dissolution tests should be performed in 0.1 N HCl for 2hours (acid stage) followed by testing in USP buffer media in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 (buffer stage) under standard (application/compential) test conditions and two additional agitation speeds using the application/compential test apparatus (three additional test conditions). If the application/compential test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compential test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. The above dissolution testing should be performed using the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product).\n\nAll modified release solid oral dosage forms: In the presence of an established in vitro/in vivo correlation (6), only application/compential dissolution testing should be performed (i.e., only in vitro release data by the correlating method should be submitted). The dissolution profiles of the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product) should be similar. The sponsor should apply appropriate statistical testing with justifications (e.g., the f({}_{2}) equation) for comparing dissolution profiles (5). Similarity testing for the two dissolution profiles (i.e., for the unchanged drug product and the changed drug product) obtained in each individual medium is appropriate.\n\nBioequivalence documentation\n\nNone.\n\nFiling Documentation\n\nChanges Being Effected supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\nVII Manufacturing Equipment Changes\n\nManufacturing changes may involve the equipment used in the manufacturing process (critical manufacturing variable). If a manufacturer wishes to use manufacturing equipment that is not identical in every respect to the original manufacturing equipment used in the approved application, appropriate validation studies should be conducted to demonstrate that the new equipment is similar to the original equipment. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the change in manufacturing equipment is critical to drug release (critical equipment variable).\n\nA.: Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nThis category consists of (1) change from nonautomated or nonmechanical equipment to automated or mechanical equipment to move ingredients and (2) change to alternative equipment of the same design and operating principles of the same or of a different capacity.\n\nTest documentation\n\na.

If a manufacturer wishes to use a manufacturing process that is not identical in every respect to the original manufacturing process used in the approved application, appropriate validation studies should be conducted to demonstrate that the new process is similar to the original process. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the change in manufacturing process is critical to drug release (critical processing variable). For purposes of categorizing the level of changes, process change may be considered only to affect a release controlling excipient when both types of excipients (i.e., nonrelease and release controlling) are present during the unit operation undergoing a change.\n\nLevel 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nProcess changes involving adjustment of equipment operating conditions such as mixing times and operating speeds within original approved application ranges affecting the nonrelease controlling and/or release controlling excipient(s). The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications for claiming any excipient(s) as a nonrelease controlling or a release controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na.

It is unlikely that the parameters will have been previously validated. Therefore, it would appear that any such change will be a level 2 change. Please comment. A: If a scale-down of the production batch to 2 or 1/10 the size is needed, operating parameters that would fall within the range established for manufacture of the test batch and the first three production batches (i.e., validation batches) will be regarded as a level 1 change. If they fall outside the validation ranges the change would be permitted under SUPAC IR as a level 2 change. Regardless, SUPAC IR does not address scale-down below 100,000 units. 2. Q: Is a change in mill screen size (to improve flow during formulation) a level 1 change?A: A screen size change to an alternate screen of the same design (holes) and operating principle (sifting) but different diameters to facilitate flow of powder will be regarded as a level 1 change, provided the alternate screen has not altered the particle size distribution of the screened material. Under such conditions, the information can be filed in the annual report.3. Q: Must the equipment be moved from the old site to the new one when the manufacturing site is changed? A: A company need not move equipment for a SUPAC-IR site change. However, any equipment should be of the same design and operating principle as the old equipment, and the SOPs and formulation should be the same.\n\n3.1. In vitro dissolution\n\nQ: Can the equation for profile dissolution be used for comparing a generic product with the reference listed drug product?A: Yes. The equation can be used in this situation. However, under SUPAC-IR, dissolution testing is generally conducted on the applicant's product before and after a particular change is made.2. Q: For Case C testing, specific media are cited. Can other media or other pH's be used?A: The five media indicated for Case C dissolution testing are presented as examples only. Other media, as appropriate for a particular drug product, if properly justified, may be used. Such a situation could involve using different solution compositions to attain a certain pH, as well as some at different pH conditions.3. Q: For SUPAC-IR changes which require multi-point dissolution in several media, is this required of AA drug products? A: For AA drugs (i.e., those drugs identified in the Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations or the \"Orange Book\" as not presenting bioequivalence problems) when the original application only required multi-point single medium dissolution testing for approval, then a multi-point single medium dissolution will be satisfactory where Case C is specified in the SUPAC-IR guidance.4. Q: The inclusion of \"n\" in the f2 formula implies that the number and time of the pulls is left to the discretion of the FDA investigator. Choosing points late in the curve could insure a high f2. How will this be avoided?A: It is recommended that only one point past the plateau of the profiles be used.5. Q: Are the points for dissolution profiles listed in the document just guides, or do you expect to see those specific points? For a quickly dissolving drug, points at 10, 20, 30, and 40 may be more appropriate.A: The points listed should be considered to be examples. Others points can be used with justification. It is suggested that at least 4 points (other than zero), equally spaced, be utilized.6. Q: What options are available if f2 fails?A: If an applicant believes the profiles are similar even if dissolution profiles fail f2, the firm may present a scientific justification as to why the observed difference is not due to the proposed change, and could not have significant impact beyond what is normally seen for batches prepared without the change.7. Q: For case C testing, if all of the media are not ones typically used, must the dissolution procedure be validated using these media?A: Yes. All of the methods used should be validated.8. Q: What methods, other than Dr. Amidon's are acceptable?A: This is an evolving area or research. \"Extent of absorption\" may be an appropriate alternative, as indicated in the guidance. Full documentation of permeability may require special clinical testing. Physicochemical and in vitro predictors of permeability are being assessed at the FDA. Pending availability of these methods, firms may rely on literature data from pharmacokinetic/mass balance studies that suggest high extent of absorption of a drug across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Absent this information, firms should assume that a drug substance has low permeability and follow the recommendations in the SUPAC-IR guidance accordingly. 9. Q: How exactly is the industry expected to determine or know the permeability of their drug?A: One source of permeability information is the current research being conducted and sponsored by FDA. This information, for other drugs, could be experimentally determined by an applicant. Other alternative methods, related to permeability, may also be useful.10. Q: Are we allowed to monitor the metabolites and sum all the components?A: For determination of extent of absorption related to permeability, it may be appropriate to consider the sum of all components. As described in the guidance, this is \"in the absence of documented instability in the gastro-intestinal tract.\" In general, it is appropriate to sum all of the components if the formation of the metabolite occurs following permeation through the gastrointestinal mucosa.11. Q: What constitutes an acceptable in vivo/in vitro correlation? Does \"verified\" mean validated? A: Verified may be thought of as synonymous with validated. The Biopharmaceutics Coordinating Committee in CDER is developing guidance that addresses the general question. Pending availability of this guidance, firms should refer to published literature for information on establishing in vitro/in vivo correlations.\n\n11 IN Vivo Bio Studies\n\nQ: If the highest strength was the biobatch strength, and waivers were used for the other strengths, does supporting documentation for SUPAC-IR changes refer to all strengths? Does the answer differ depending on whether the strengths are dose/weight proportional?A: For SUPAC-IR bioequivalence recommendations, the recommended tests apply to all strengths. Regarding bio-requirements, the supporting documentation normally is needed for all strengths. If a bioequivalence study is recommended, then the compositional proportionality of the various strengths may determine if all strengths need to be tested for bioequivalence, or if a strength can be waived. However, this is not the standard comparison that is in the SUPAC-IR Guidance.2. Q: Will many small changes prompt the Agency to require a biostudy?A: Generally, a biostudy will not be requested simply because many changes which individually would not normally require a biostudy, are performed.3. Q: For SUPAC-IR changes which require an in-vivo bioequivalence test, is this requirement also intended for AA drugs which were exempt from bioequivalence testing when originally approved?A: The Center did not intend for SUPAC-IR to impose additional bioequivalence requirements for AA drugs beyond those in an original application. (AA drugs are those identified in the Orange Book as not presenting bioequivalence problems.) Therefore, if bioequivalence testing was not required originally, it will not be required under SUPAC-IR for AA drugs.\n\nQ: Would an in vivo bioequivalence study be needed for an AAA@ or non-bioequivalence problem DESI drug even if it one would be needed according to SUPAC?\n\nA: No, since that would conflict with the agency's current bioequivalence policy. 5. Q: When a bio study is required under SUPAC-IR, to what product should a generic product be compared - the Reference Listed Drug or the generic product approved prior to the SUPAC change.\n\nA: An innovator product should be compared to itself. A generic should be compared to the reference listed drug for that drug product.\n\nStability/change in batch size\n\nQ: When the documentation for a change is one batch on long term stability, is there a time limit between implementation of the change and initiation of the stability study?A: No. But the stability study should start as soon as possible after the drug product is prepared in the market container.2. Q: What is the stability requirement for a level 3 change involving a product with multiple strengths packaged in bottles and blisters? SUPAC-IR states one batch. Can we bracket?A: Testing and data collection involving the use of product bracketing are not the subject of SUPAC-IR. Bracketing may be used with prior approval of the Agency. The amount of data required depends on the type of change and whether or not there is a significant body of data available. If an applicant plans to bracket, the proposed protocol should be submitted to the Agency. This plan should include a protocol for each product. It should indicate all of the approved packaging configurations, and what strengths are approved for each of these. It also should include the approved stability test protocol.3. Q: Who determines how many batches are required for stability when the documentation requests 1-3?A: The answer will be dependent on the specific drug product and the amount of data already available. The appropriate review division should be contacted for further guidance.4. Q: When accelerated stability data are required, is that comparative data?\n\nA: Yes. Historical data may be used for comparison.\n\n7 Miscellaneous Issues\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.0074584484100342", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: GUIDANCE DOCUMENT\n\nSUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR\n\nGuidance\n\nFEBRUARY 1997\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/supac-ir-questions-and-answers-about-supac-ir-guidance)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\n(February 18, 1997)\n\nAll NDA, ANDA, and AADA Holders\n\nDear Sponsors:\n\nOn November 30, 1995, the Scale-up and Post-Approval Changes Guidance for Immediate Release Products (SUPAC-IR) was published. Since then a number of questions have arisen in interpreting the Guidance as it applies to specific situations encountered or that could be encountered in the pharmaceutical industry. The purpose of this letter is primarily to share with you the questions that have been asked most frequently or that we consider the most significant. Also included are the Center's responses to these questions. The responses were developed and concurred with by the Office of New Drug Chemistry and Office of Generic Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). We believe the sharing of the information will result in furthering the use of the Guidance to increase regulatory flexibility for industry.\n\nIn addition, the Center's Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls Coordinating Committee (CMC CC) has met and reconsidered two SUPAC-IR issues which have been of great concern and interest to industry. The following information on stand alone packaging operation site changes and stand alone analytical site changes represents a re-assessment of how SUPAC-IR should be interpreted on these issues.\n\n7 Stand alone packaging operations site changes\n\nFor immediate release solid oral dosage forms, a stand alone packaging operations site change, utilizing container(s)/closure(s) in the approved application, may be submitted as a Changes Being Effected supplement. The facility should also have a current and satisfactory cGMP compliance profile with FDA for the type of packaging operation in question before submitting the supplement. The supplement should contain written certification from the packaging facility stating that it is in conformance with cGMP's. If the facility has not received a satisfactory cGMP inspection within the previous two years for the type of packaging operation involved, a prior-approval supplement with the same commitment for stability is recommended.\n\nThe supplement should also contain a commitment to place the first production batch of the product on long-term stability studies using the approved protocol in the application and to submit the resulting data in annual reports. Where the product is available in more than one strength, size, or container/closure system, one batch of each combination should be placed on long-term stability studies. Bracketing or matrixing is allowed only if it has been approved previously by FDA. Any changes to an approved stability protocol should have a supplemental approval prior to the initiation of the stability study. Batches should be tested annually as per the stability commitments in the approved application.\n\n3 Stand Alone Analytical Testing Lab Site Changes\n\nFor immediate release solid oral dosage forms, a stand alone analytical testing laboratory site change may be submitted as a Changes Being Effected supplement, if the new facility has a current and satisfactory cGMP compliance profile with FDA for the type of testing operation in question. The supplement should contain a commitment to use the same SOP's and test methods employed in the approved application, written certification from the testing laboratory stating that they are in conformance with cGMP's, and a full description of the testing to be performed by the testing lab. If the facility has not received a satisfactory GMP inspection within the previous 2 years for the type of testing involved, a prior-approval supplement is recommended.\n\nThe CMC CC and the Center intend that the SUPAC-IR Guidance will be revised to further clarify and update its recommendations and to assure good correspondence between these recommendations and those of other SUPAC documents in preparation. In the meantime, we hope these questions and answers will help clarify the application of the Guidance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n/s /\n\nRoger L. Williams, M.

Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind the FDA or the industry, it does represent the Agency's current thinking on questions related to the Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes Guidance for Immediate Release Products (SUPAC-IR). An electronic version of these questions and answers are also available via Internet using the World Wide Web (WWW). To access the document on the WWW, connect to the CDER Home Page (http://wcms-prod-cntr-app2.fda.gov/sites/default/files/ucm2018538.xcsr) and go to the \"Regulatory Guidance (/guidances-drugs)\" section.)\n\nComponent and Composition Changes\n\nQ: May one color be replaced with another by placing the batch on concurrent stability and reporting it in the annual report?A: A change from one color to another should be submitted as a prior approval supplement.2. Q: Can color be changed under SUPAC-IR?A: Yes. A change in color, either in amount or from one color to another, is a level 3 component and composition change which calls for a prior approval supplement. However, if the color is merely being removed, it is a level 1 change and can be reported in the next annual report.3. Q: What is the full definition of a change in 'technical grade\" of an excipient? Does this only mean a change in excipient specifications that may impact functionality or does it include a change in supplier even if all applicable specifications remain the same? A: Technical grades of excipients differ in their specifications and intended use. Technical grades may differ in: 1) specifications and/or functionality; 2) impurities; and 3) impurity profiles. If a supplier of an excipient changes but its technical grade AND specifications remain the same, the agency should be notified in an annual report.4. Q: How does one apply SUPAC-IR to multifunctional excipients, e.g., starch?A: SUPER-IR composition changes are based on being able to define the use or action of the particular excipient in the product. This rationale should be included by the applicants as part of their original applications. Not all multifunctional excipients are listed in the guidance. However, if an excipient was utilized to provide multiple functions such as pregelatinized starch as a filler, starch as a disintegrant, starch paste as a binder, then the most conservative recommended change should be followed (e.g., for an excipient that is a filler, disintegration and binder, the recommended limit for a Level 2 change is \" 0.5 percent, see page 7, SUPAC-IR). An applicant may wish to add an explanation of how the change will affect other functions of the excipient in the product. If this information was not included in the original application, the review division should be consulted before filing such a SUPAC change, either through a CBE or annual report.\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6826094388961792", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.1.3 Selection of Batches (2.1.3)\n\nData from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the drug substance. The batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route as production batches and using a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on formal stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nii.1.4 Container Closure System (2.1.4)\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the drug substance packaged in a container closure system that is the same as or simulates the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\nii.1.5 Specification (2.1.5)\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, is addressed in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances and Q6B__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Biotechnological/Biological Products. In addition, specification for degradation products in a drug substance is discussed in ICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances.\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed should depend on the results from validation studies.\n\nTesting Frequency (2.1.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug substance. For drug substances with a proposed retest period of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed retest period.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that the results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nStorage Conditions (2.1.7)\n\nIn general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug substances are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug substance is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) or (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}).\n\n** If (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) and significant change occurs at any time during 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. Testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all tests, unless otherwise justified. The initial application should include a minimum of 6 months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\nSignificant change for a drug substance is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\nData from refrigerated storage should be assessed according to the evaluation section of this guidance, except where explicitly noted below.\n\nIf significant change occurs between 3 and 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the real time data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\nIf significant change occurs within the first 3 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling). This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the drug substance for a period shorter than 3 months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test a drug substance through 6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.\n\nFor drug substances intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period should be based on the real time data obtained at the long-term storage condition. In the absence of an accelerated storage condition for drug substances intended to be stored in a freezer, testing on a single batch at an elevated temperature (e.g., (5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) or (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})) for an appropriate time period should be conducted to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling).\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) (2.1.7.4)\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) should be treated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8 Stability Commitment (2.1.8)\n\nWhen available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed retest period granted at the time of approval, a commitment should be made to continue the stability studies postapproval to firmly establish the retest period.\n\nWhere the submission includes long-term stability data on three production batches covering the proposed retest period, a postapproval commitment is considered unnecessary. Otherwise, one of the following commitments should be made:\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period and to place additional production batches, to a total of at least three, on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission does not include stability data on production batches, a commitment should be made to place the first three production batches on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nThe stability protocol used for long-term studies for the stability commitment should be the same as that for the primary batches, unless otherwise scientifically justified.\n\n9.1.9 Evaluation (2.1.9)\n\nThe purpose of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance and evaluating the stability information (including, as appropriate, results of the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the drug substance manufactured under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification throughout the assigned retest period.\n\nThe data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under these circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis; providing a justification for the omission should be sufficient.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.340444326400757", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA will RTR an ANDA if both worst-case scenario and non-worst-case stability data adhering to the recommendations described in section V.2.1 and this section are not submitted for the described drug product batches: liquids, solutions, semi-solids, and suspensions.55\n\nFootnote 55: See 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)(i) stating that ANDAs must include chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information required under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix C Packaging Amount Considerations\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA does not package a minimum (threshold) amount of the finished drug product in the container/closure systems that are proposed for marketing, as discussed in FDA's guidance for industry ANDAs: Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers.56 Also as discussed in the guidance, the threshold amount that should be packaged is governed by the specific dosage form (e.g., solid oral dosage forms, oral powders/solutions/suspensions, parenteral drug products, ophthalmic/otic drug products, transdermal patches, and topicals such as creams/lotions/gels and inhalation solutions/nasal sprays) of the finished drug product that is the subject of the ANDA submission.\n\nFootnote 56: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\n\nTo qualify the dosage units that are packaged toward the applicable threshold, the following three recommended criteria for each container/closure configuration should be satisfied:\n\nStability data (as described in section V.2.1 of this guidance).\n\nContainer/closure system information should be submitted in ANDA section 3.2.P.7. If bracketing or matrixing is used, an ANDA should include the container/closure system information applicable to configurations that were excluded from stability studies because of bracketing or matrixing.\n\nContainer and carton (if applicable) labeling for each packaging configuration containing dosage units to be counted in the overall packaged total should be provided in section 1.14.1 of the ANDA.\n\nAppendix D Batch Records\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if blank and executed batch records are not provided, regardless of whether commercial scale-up is proposed.57 For example, both commercial (blank) and executed (pilot) batch records for the pilot batches that are manufactured to support an ANDA should be submitted, along with any accompanying reconciliation sheets.\n\nFootnote 57: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if method validation/verification reports are not provided.58 It is critical that method validation/verification reports for all analytical methods be provided in sections 3.2.S.4.3 and 3.2.P.5.3 of the ANDA, for both the drug substance (API) and drug product, respectively. That is, for drug products for which a relevant official United States Pharmacopeia (USP) drug product monograph exists, verification59 of the USP analytical procedures should be provided. Verification should also be submitted for methods used from outside sources, such as a Type II API DMF holder, unless the methods have been fully validated in house. For any in-house methods used, validation of the analytical procedure should be submitted in either of the appropriate sections of the ANDA (i.e., sections 3.2.S.4.3 or 3.2.P.5.3). In-house methods used in lieu of USP methods should be compared to the USP method to support a demonstration that the in-house method is sufficient.\n\nFootnote 58: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1) and 314.94(a)(9)(i).\n\nFootnote 59: 25 EP (European Pharmacopoeia)/BP (British Pharmacopoeia)/JP (Japanese Pharmacopoeia) methods may be allowed, for which, in many cases, verification (versus full validation) may suffice.\n\nFootnote 60: On May 5, 2017, the electronic submission of ANDAs in a format specified by FDA will be required. See discussion in section III.B.\n\nIn addition, for ANDAs not submitted electronically60, the applicant should submit three copies of the method validation/verification package for the API, the drug product, or both.61\n\nFootnote 61: 21 CFR 314.50(e)(2)(i).\n\nFootnote 63: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix F Special Consideration for Transdermal Patches\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA for a transdermal patch if the ANDA does not address certain special considerations.62,63\n\nFootnote 63: In addition to the considerations identified in this section, FDA has provided recommendations on the submission of studies evaluating the adhesive performance of a Transdermal Delivery System (TDS) or topical patch in support of an ANDA in the guidance for industry Assessing Adhesion with Transdermal Delivery Systems and Topical Patches for ANDAs. The recommendations provided in the guidance will supersede the recommendations related to adhesion studies provided in individual product-specific recommendations published before the guidance was issued. Accordingly, FDA will RTR an ANDA for failure to follow the recommendations in the guidance once the final guidance is issued.\n\nMatrix Systems\n\nANDAs for matrix transdermal systems should be supported by stability data on three batches of drug product manufactured from three distinct laminates, where each batch of laminate is made using different lots of API, adhesives, backing, and/or other critical elements in the drug product. If an applicant is seeking approval for multiple strengths of a particular drug product, the applicant can choose to use a bracket approach by manufacturing three batches of the highest and lowest strengths and at least one batch of each of the bracketed strengths. An example is given below. * Laminate Batch # 1 (pilot-scale): All strengths (highest, lowest, and bracketed) * Laminate Batch # 2 (pilot-scale): Highest and lowest strengths * Laminate Batch # 3 (pilot- or small-scale): Highest and lowest strengths\n* Reservoir Systems\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]\n\ncontainer as the RLD. Therefore, a deviation from the fill volume (total drug content) of the RLD parenteral drug product may constitute a change in strength. A change in strength must first be approved via the suitability petition process (see section III.F of this guidance) before it can be proposed in an ANDA submission.\n\n3. Differences in Packaging and/or Labeling That May Be Associated With the Safe/Effective Use of the Drug Product\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA on a case-by-case basis if the ANDA contains differences in packaging and/or labeling from the RLD that may be associated with safe/effective use of the drug product.66 Generally, if the RLD is packaged with certain labeling in a manner to ensure its proper administration, the test product should be packaged and labeled similarly. For example, an RLD product may incorporate labeling on its packaging that contains a combination of visual and/or typographical aids, beyond the direct label text, to facilitate patient compliance and safety. Blister packaging is an example of such packaging, whereby certain drug products communicate crucial patient information directly on the blister carton (and/or the blister itself) to both improve patient compliance and reduce the incidence of harm or injury that may result from improper administration of the drug product. A blister carton may also better allow any supplemental patient information to be attached directly to it, which in turn ensures that each patient receives the necessary drug product information upon dispensing from a pharmacy. Such a proposed product should generally be packaged similarly to the RLD to account for these considerations.\n\nFootnote 66: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8).\n\n4. Other Inconsistencies\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA contains certain other inconsistencies. In accordance with 21 CFR 314.94(a)(4), an ANDA must include a statement that the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling proposed for the drug product have been previously approved for the RLD. However, there are certain exceptions (e.g., for labeling differences permitted pursuant to an approved suitability petition that is cited as an ANDA's basis of submission (see section III.F for further details)). Any other proposed condition-of-use changes would not be acceptable. Examples of proposed condition-of-use changes may include, but are not limited to, citing a sprinkle capsule dosage form as a basis of submission but producing a capsule that cannot be administered in the same manner as the RLD, or proposing alterations to either the amount of active ingredient delivered per dose or the dosing regimen such that neither are consistent with those described in the RLD labeling.\n\nAppendix H Microbiology Considerations\n\nGenerally, FDA will RTR an ANDA if it contains certain deficiencies related to microbiology considerations.\n\nAn ANDA should contain all sterility assurance validation studies for terminally sterilized drug products and aseptically filled drug products, as described below67:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTerminally sterilized drug products\n\nValidation of production terminal sterilization process\n\nValidation of depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nAseptically filled drug products\n\nValidation of the sterilizing grade filters (bacterial retention studies)\n\nValidation of the sterilization of sterile bulk drug or product contact equipment, components, containers, and closures\n\nValidation of the depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of the aseptic filling process/line/room (media fills/process simulations)\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nIn addition, an ANDA should include at the time of submission, at minimum, summaries of validation studies.\n\nVI Bioequivalence and clinical deficiencies\n\nAs a general matter, ANDA applicants should refer to FDA's \"Product Specific Recommendations for Generic Drug Development\" website for Bioequivalence (BE) guidances regarding recommended in vivo and/or in vitro BE and other recommended studies.68\n\nFootnote 68: FDA\u2019s BE recommendations for specific products can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDA Submissions -- Refuse-to-Receive Standards Rev.2 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.4918692111968994"], "As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance\n\nPotassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Energetics\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nDecember 2001\n\nProcedural\n\nOutface\n\nPotassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Communications Management\n\nDrug Information Branch, HFD-210\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\n(Internet) http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nDecember 2001\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance\n\nPotassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking\n\nAgent in Radiation Emergencies\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe objective of this document is to provide guidance to other Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to state and local governments regarding the safe and effective use of potassium iodide (KI) as an adjunct to other public health protective measures in the event that radioactive iodine is released into the environment. The adoption and implementation of these recommendations are at the discretion of the state and local governments responsible for developing regional emergency-response plans related to radiation emergencies.\n\nThis guidance updates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1982 recommendations for the use of KI to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies involving the release of radioactive iodine. The recommendations in this guidance address KI dosage and the projected radiation exposure at which the drug should be used.\n\nThese recommendations were prepared by the Potassium Iodide Working Group, comprising scientists from the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in collaboration with experts in the field from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although they differ in two respects (as discussed in Section IV.2), these revised recommendations are in general accordance with those of the World Health Organization (WHO), as expressed in its Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis Following Nuclear Accidents: Update 1999 (WHO 1999).\n\nII Background\n\nUnder 44 CFR 351, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established roles and responsibilities for Federal agencies in assisting state and local governments in their radiological emergency planning and preparedness activities. The Federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), are to carry out these roles and responsibilities as members of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee(FRPCC). Under 44 CFR 351.23(f), HHS is directed to provide guidance to state and local governments on the use of radioprotective substances and the prophylactic use of drugs (e.g., KI) to reduce the radiation dose to specific organs. This guidance includes information about dosage and projected radiation exposures at which such drugs should be used.\n\nThe FDA has provided guidance previously on the use of KI as a thyroid blocking agent. In the Federal Register of December 15, 1978, FDA announced its conclusion that KI is a safe and effective means by which to block uptake of radioiodines by the thyroid gland in a radiation emergency under certain specified conditions of use. In the Federal Register of June 29, 1982, FDA announced final recommendations on the administration of KI to the general public in a radiation emergency. Those recommendations were formulated after reviewing studies relating radiation dose to thyroid disease risk that relied on estimates of external thyroid irradiation after the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and analogous studies among children who received therapeutic radiation to the head and neck. Those recommendations concluded that at a projected dose to the thyroid gland of 25 cGy or greater from ingested or inhaled radioiodines, the risks of short-term use of small quantities of KI were outweighed by the benefits of suppressing radioiodine-induced thyroid cancer.1 The amount of KI recommended at that time was 130 mg per day for adults and children above 1 year of age and 65 mg per day for children below 1 year of age. The guidance that follows revises our 1982 recommendations on the use of KI for thyroid cancer prophylaxis based on a comprehensive review of the data relating radioioidine exposure to thyroid cancer risk accumulated in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident.\n\nFootnote 1: For the radiation emitted by ({}^{131}) I (electrons and photons), the radiation-weighting factor is equal to one, so that the absorbed dose to the thyroid gland expressed in centigrays (cGy) is numerically equal to the thyroid equivalent dose expressed in rem (1 cGy = 1 rem).\n\n3 Data Sources\n\nReliance on Data from Chernobyl\n\nIn epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between thyroidal radioiodine exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, the estimation of thyroid radiation doses is a critical and complex aspect of the analyses. Estimates of exposure, both for individuals and across populations, have been reached in different studies by the variable combination of (1) direct thyroid measurements in a segment of the exposed population; (2) measurements of ({}^{131})I (iodine isotope) concentrations in the milk consumed by different groups (e.g., communities) and of the quantity of milk consumed; (3) inference from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes released coincidentally and presumably in fixed ratios with radioiodines; and (4) reconstruction of the nature and extent of the actual radiation release.\n\nAll estimates of individual and population exposure contain some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty is least for estimates of individual exposure based on direct thyroid measurements.\n\nUncertainty increases with reliance on milk consumption estimates; is still greater with estimates derived from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes, and is highest for estimates that rely heavily on release reconstruction.\n\nDirect measurements of thyroid radioactivity are unavailable from the Hanford, Nevada Test Site, and Marshall Islands exposures. Indeed, the estimates of thyroid radiation doses related to these releases rely heavily on release reconstructions and, in the former two cases, on recall of the extent of milk consumption 40 to 50 years after the fact. In the Marshall Islands cohort, urinary radioiodine excretion data were obtained and used in calculating exposure estimates.\n\nBecause of the great uncertainty in the dose estimates from the Hanford and Nevada Test Site exposures and due to the small numbers of thyroid cancers occurring in the populations potentially exposed, the epidemiological studies of the excess thyroid cancer risk related to these radioiodine releases are, at best, inconclusive. As explained below, the dosimetric data derived in the studies of individual and population exposures following the Chernobyl accident, although not perfect, are unquestionably superior to data from previous releases. In addition, the results of the earlier studies are inadequate to refute cogent case control study evidence from Chernobyl of a cause-effect relationship between thyroid radioiodine deposition and thyroid cancer risk.2\n\nFootnote 2: We have included in this guidance an extensive bibliography of the sources used in developing these revised recommendations.\n\nThe Chernobyl reactor accident of April 1986 provides the best-documented example of a massive radionuclide release in which large numbers of people across a broad geographical area were exposed acutely to radioiodines released into the atmosphere. Therefore, the recommendations contained in this guidance are derived from our review of the Chernobyl data as they pertain to the large number of thyroid cancers that occurred. These are the most comprehensive and reliable data available describing the relationship between thyroid radiation dose and risk for thyroid cancer following an environmental release of ({}^{131})I. In contrast, the exposures resulting from radiation releases at the Hanford Site in Washington State in the mid-1940s and in association with the nuclear detonations at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s were extended over years, rather than days to weeks, contributing to the difficulty in estimating radioactive dose in those potentially exposed (Davis et al., 1999; Gilbert et al., 1998). The exposure of Marshall Islanders to fallout from the nuclear detonation on Bikini in 1954 involved relatively few people, and although the high rate of subsequent thyroid nodules and cancers in the exposed population was likely caused in large part by radioiodines, the Marshall Islands data provide little insight into the dose-response relationship between radioactive iodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk (Robbins and Adams 1989).\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.926231861114502", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: The FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to note that among 7 million adults who took stable iodine in Poland following Chernobyl, only two severe adverse reactions were reported, both in persons with known allergy to iodine. Based on these data, we have concluded that even if the risks associated with excess stable iodine are greater in adults than in children, the risk of serious adverse reactions overall is exceedingly small.\n\nIn summary, FDA understands that a KI administration program that sets different projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for treatment of different population groups may be logistically impractical to implement during a radiological emergency. If emergency planners reach this conclusion, FDA recommends that KI be administered to both children and adults at the lowest intervention threshold (i.e., (\\geq 5) cGy projected internal thyroid exposure in children).\n\nAs a rule, however, individuals with known allergy to KI or with pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) that might predispose them to adverse reactions should avoid KI. Most likely these will be adults, who have little or no risk of developing thyroid cancer from radioactive exposure to the thyroid and who may, in these cases, incur substantial risks from taking KI.\n\nQ8: Does the FDA guidance apply to residents outside of the 10-mile emergency planning zone for nuclear poset plants?\n\nYes. KI administered in advance of an exposure will successfully block thyroidal uptake of radioiodine, wherever one may reside.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.541451454162598", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: For optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n\nFDA maintains that KI is a safe and effective means by which to prevent radioiodine uptake by the thyroid gland, under certain specified conditions of use, and thereby obviate the risk of thyroid cancer in the event of a radiation emergency. Based upon review of the literature, we have proposed lower radioactive exposure thresholds for KI prophylaxis as well as lower doses of KI for neonates, infants, and children than we recommended in 1982. As in our 1982 notice in the Federal Register, FDA continues to recommend that radiation emergency response plans include provisions, in the event of a radiation emergency, for informing the public about the magnitude of the radiation hazard, about the manner of use of KI and its potential benefits and risks, and for medical contact, reporting, and assistance systems. FDA also emphasizes that emergency response plans and any systems for ensuring availability of KI to the public should recognize the critical importance of KI administration in advance of exposure to radioiodine. As in the past, FDA continues to work in an ongoing fashion with manufacturers of KI to ensure that high-quality, safe, and effective KI products are available for purchase by consumers as well as by state and local governments wishing to establish stores for emergency distribution.\n\nKI provides protection only for the thyroid from radioiodines. It has no impact on the uptake by the body of other radioactive materials and provides no protection against external irradiation of any kind. FDA emphasizes that the use of KI should be as an adjunct to evacuation (itself not always feasible), sheltering, and control of foodstuffs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe KI Taskforce would like to extend special thanks to our members from the NIH: Jacob Robbins, M.D., and Jan Wolff, Ph.D., M.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases and Andre Bouville, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides answers to questions that FDA has received as state and local governments develop emergency response plans involving the use of potassium iodide (KI) to protect against the effects of radioactive iodine accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere. KI is recommended for use as an adjunct to other emergency measures, such as evacuation and control of the food supply to avoid ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. When used correctly, KI can prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. KI provides optimal protection when administered immediately prior to or in conjunction with passage of a radioactive cloud. The incorporation of KI into radiation emergency response plans is at the discretion of state and local governments.\n\nThis is a revision of the question and answer guidance published in April 2002. The revision incorporates two additional questions (question 4 and question 7) raised about KI intervention and makes minor editorial changes to the previous questions and answers.\n\nII Background\n\nIn a guidance entitled Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies (December 2001), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its 1982 recommendations for the safe and effective use of KI to prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. The current recommendations are based on conclusions reached after reviewing data on radioiodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk gathered after the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986. The data suggest that the risk of thyroid cancer is inversely related to age. Fetuses, infants, and young children are at greatest risk and may be harmed by small amounts of radioiodine.\n\nAlthough special precautions should be taken when administering KI to pregnant women and newborns within the first month of life (adherence to the recommended dose, avoidance of repeat dosing, and monitoring of thyroid function in neonates), the benefits of short-term administration of KI as a thyroid blocking agent far exceed the risks of administration to any age group. For complete information, please refer to FDA's December 2001 guidance.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1:: Does FDA have specific recommendations about radiation emergency preparedness plans and the use of KI?\n\nNo. Decisions about the details of their preparedness plans are up to state and local authorities. FDA's guidance provides general recommendations about the use of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiological emergency. These recommendations are discussed in Section V. of the guidance.\n\nQ2:: Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n\nNo. FDA has made recommendations on the lowest effective dose. Higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg) would be equally effective and, particularly among school-age children, extremely safe (see also question 9).\n\nQ3:: If a graded dosing approach is considered, how does FDA suggest that fractional doses (i.e., 65, 32, 16 mg) be administered?\n\nKI tablets can be dissolved in liquids and the appropriate volume administered. For example, if a 130 mg tablet were dissolved in 8 ounces of liquid, one ounce would contain about 16 mg of KI. FDA has conducted studies of the palatability, solubility, and stability of KI dissolved in a number of different liquids, including juice and formula. (See the Home Preparation Procedure for Emergency Administration of Potassium Iodide Tablets to Infants and Small Children.2) Emergency planners and others should understand that absolute precision in dosing is generally not critical to safety or efficacy (see also question 4).\n\nFootnote 2: This is available at http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/default.htm.\n\nQ4.: FDA guidance recommends graded dosing by age, with neonates receiving the lowest dose (16 mg daily) and adults receiving the highest (130 mg). FDA approved KI tablets are available in two dosage strengths: 65 and 130 mg. At a minimum, dosing based on FDA guidance would require either splitting tablets or dissolving tablets in liquids. This may be impractical while responding to a radiological emergency. In this context, what is the impact of uniform dosing across all age groups eligible for KI prophylaxis?* The FDA's guidance on dosing KI in radiation emergencies adheres to principles of minimum effective dose and therefore recommends graded dosing according to age (and thus, in effect, body size). There is ample evidence that the recommended doses, as well as higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg), will effectively block thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine if taken in advance of exposure. Furthermore, particularly among school-age children, higher milligram doses are extremely safe. We also realize that a scheme of graded dosing may be difficult to implement during a radiological emergency involving large numbers of people. However, we continue to emphasize attention to KI dosing in infants. Excess iodine intake can lead to transient iodine-induced hypothyroidism. As we have said in our guidance, individuals who are intolerant of KI at protective doses, as well as neonates, pregnant, and lactating women, should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nIn summary, if local emergency planners conclude that graded dosing is logistically impractical, FDA believes that for populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of taking up to 130 mg of KI instead of the lower doses recommended for certain age groups far exceed the small risks of overdosing. However, where feasible, adherence to FDA guidance should be attempted when dosing infants.\n\nWill dosage strengths of KI below 130 mg be available in the United States?\n\nYes. An FDA approved 65-mg KI tablet is being marketed now in the United States.\n\nAre there plans to update the labeling for marketed KI products to conform to the revised FDA recommendations on dosing?\n\nYes. FDA is working with manufacturers to amend the \"Drug Facts\" labeling for KI products, which are sold over the counter, to incorporate the new dosing recommendations.\n\nHow critical to public health is adherence to FDA's recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category? Specifically, the existence of different thresholds for neonates, children through age 18, and pregnant or lactating women ((\\geq) 5 cGy) versus adults aged 18 through 40 years ((\\geq) 10 cGy) versus adults over age 40 ((\\geq) 500 cGy) are confusing and logistically complex to follow in responding to a radiological emergency.\n\nThe FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.21391205489635468", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Thyroidal side effects of stable iodine include iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, which is more common in older people and in iodine deficient areas but usually requires repeated doses of stable iodine. In addition, iodide goiter and hypothyroidism are potential side effects more common in iodine sufficient areas, but they require chronic high doses of stable iodine (Rubery 1990). In light of the preceding, individuals with multinodular goiter, Graves' disease, and autoimmune thyroiditis should be treated with caution, especially if dosing extends beyond a few days. The vast majority of such individuals will be adults.\n\nThe transient hypothyroidism observed in 0.37 percent (12 of 3214) of neonates treated with KI in Poland after Chernobyl has been without reported sequelae to date. There is no question that the benefits of KI treatment to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer outweigh the risks of such treatment in neonates. Nevertheless, in light of the potential consequences of even transient hypothyroidism for intellectual development, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for this effect by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calaciura 1995).\n\nAppendix B KI Use in Radiation Emergencies: Treatment Recommendations\n\nAfter careful review of the data from Chernobyl relating estimated thyroid radiation dose and cancer risk in exposed children, FDA is revising its recommendation for administration of KI based on age, predicted thyroid exposure, and pregnancy and lactation status (see Table).\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Threshold Thyroid Radioactive Exposures and} \\ \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Recommended Doses of KI for Different Risk Groups} \\ \\hline  & Predicted & KI dose (mg) & # of 130 mg & # of 65 \\  & Thyroid & tablets & mg tablets \\  & exposure(cGy) & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 40 yrs & (>)500 & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 18 through 40 yrs & (>)10 & & & \\ \\hline Pregnant or lactating women & & 130 & 1 & 2 \\ \\hline Adoles. over 12 through 18 yrs & (\\geq) 5 & & & \\ \\hline Children over 3 through 12 yrs & & 65 & 1/2 & 1 \\ \\hline Over 1 month through 3 years & & 32 & 1/4 & 1/2 \\ \\hline Birth through 1 month & & 16 & 1/8 & 1/4 \\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Adolescents approaching adult size ((\\geq) 70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg).} \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nThe protective effect of KI lasts approximately 24 hours. For optimal prophylaxis, KI should therefore be dosed daily, until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodines by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists. Individuals intolerant of KI at protective doses, and neonates, pregnant and lactating women (in whom repeat administration of KI raises particular safety issues, see below) should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nNote that adults over 40 need take KI only in the case of a projected large internal radiation dose to the thyroid ((>)500 cGy) to prevent hypothyroidism.\n\nThese recommendations are meant to provide states and local authorities as well as other agencies with the best current guidance on safe and effective use of KI to reduce thyroidal radioiodine exposure and thus the risk of thyroid cancer. FDA recognizes that, in the event of an emergency, some or all of the specific dosing recommendations may be very difficult to carry out given their complexity and the logistics of implementation of a program of KI distribution. The recommendations should therefore be interpreted with flexibility as necessary to allow optimally effective and safe dosing given the exigencies of any particular emergency situation. In this context, we offer the following critical general guidance: across populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of KI far exceed the risks of overdosing, especially in children, though we continue to emphasize particular attention to dose in infants.\n\nThese FDA recommendations differ from those put forward in the World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 guidelines for iodine prophylaxis in two ways. WHO recommends a 130-mg dose of KI for adults and adolescents (over 12 years). For the sake of logistical simplicity in the dispensing and administration of KI to children, FDA recommends a 65-mg dose as standard for all school-age children while allowing for the adult dose (130 mg, 2 X 65 mg tablets) in adolescents approaching adult size. The other difference lies in the threshold for predicted exposure of those up to 18 years of age and of pregnant or lactating women that should trigger KI prophylaxis. WHO recommends a threshold of 1 cGy for these two groups. As stated earlier, FDA has concluded from the Chernobyl data that the most reliable evidence supports a significant increase in the risk of childhood thyroid cancer at exposures of 5 cGy or greater.\n\nThe downward KI dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65 mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., (>)70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16 mg) of KI. Repeat dosing of KI should be avoided in the neonate to minimize the risk of hypothyroidism during that critical phase of brain development (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995). KI from tablets (either whole or fractions) or as fresh saturated KI solution may be diluted in milk, formula, or water and the appropriate volume administered to babies. As stated above, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for the potential development of hypothyroidism by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995).\n\nPregnant women should be given KI for their own protection and for that of the fetus, as iodine (whether stable or radioactive) readily crosses the placenta. However, because of the risk of blocking fetal thyroid function with excess stable iodine, repeat dosing with KI of pregnant women should be avoided. Lactating females should be administered KI for their own protection, as for other young adults, and potentially to reduce the radioiodine content of the breast milk, but not as a means to deliver KI to infants, who should get their KI directly. As for direct administration of KI, stable iodine as a component of breast milk may also pose a risk of hypothyroidism in nursing neonates. Therefore, repeat dosing with KI should be avoided in the lactating mother, except during continuing severe contamination. If repeat dosing of the mother is necessary, the nursing neonate should be monitored as recommended above.\n\nAdditional Considerations in Prophylaxis against Thyroid Radioidoline Exposure\n\nCertain principles should guide emergency planning and implementation of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiation emergency. After the Chernobyl accident, across the affected populations, thyroid radiation exposures occurred largely due to consumption of contaminated fresh cow's milk (this contamination was the result of milk cows grazing on fields affected by radioactive fallout) and to a much lesser extent by consumption of contaminated vegetables. In this or similar accidents, for those residing in the immediate area of the accident or otherwise directly exposed to the radioactive plume, inhalation of radioiodines may be a significant contributor to individual and population exposures. As a practical matter, it may not be possible to assess the risk of thyroid exposure from inhaled radioiodines at the time of the emergency. The risk depends on factors such as the magnitude and rate of the radioiodine release, wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, and thus may affect people both near to and far from the accident site.\n\nFor optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.11349464952945709", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 11: See Volf V (1978), Treatment of Incorporated Transuranium Elements.

Prevention or Reversal of Radiocontaminant Interaction with Tissues\n\na. Blocking and Diluting Agents\n\nFor radiocontaminants already in the blood, blocking and diluting agents will reduce uptake at target tissues. Administering a blocking agent such as potassium iodide (KI) allows for saturation of metabolic processes in the thyroid with stable, nonradioactive iodine thereby preventing uptake of radioactive iodine. In 1978, FDA announced its\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nChelators are substances that bind with certain metals to form a stable complex that can be more rapidly eliminated from the body via excretion by the kidneys.\n\nDiethylenetriaminepentacetate (DTPA), as the calcium or zinc salt, has been used in this way as an investigational agent for many years.[7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19] DTPA forms stable complexes with transuranium elements, and these complexes are renally excreted, thus decreasing body burden. The calcium and zinc salts of DTPA have both been used investigationally for the treatment of plutonium, americium, or curium internal contamination under an IND (investigational new drug) application held by the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS). Ca-DTPA is administered as a single intravenous injection or inhaled dose as soon as possible after contamination, and repeated doses of Zn-DTPA administered intravenously may be given daily as maintenance therapy, as necessary. Based on a review of clinical data maintained by REAC/TS on acute occupational exposures, in 2003 FDA determined that Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA, when produced under conditions specified in an approved NDA, can be safe and effective for the treatment of internal contamination with plutonium, americium, and curium.[20] At the same time, FDA announced the availability of a guidance document, Calcium DTPA and Zinc DTPA Drug Products: Submitting a New Drug Application, to assist manufacturers who plan to submit NDAs for Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA. FDA has approved NDAs submitted by Hameln Pharmaceuticals GmbH for Ca- and Zn-DTPA.\n\nDTPAs bind uranium less well and are not expected to be effective for uranium contamination (see Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA product labeling at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/DTPA/default.htm). Uranium contamination has been treated with oral sodium bicarbonate, regulated to maintain an alkaline urine pH, and accompanied by diuretics.2 Oral sodium bicarbonate has not been approved in the United States for this indication.\n\nFootnote 2: See Breitenstein BD, Fry SA, and Lushbaugh CC (1990), DTPA Therapy: The US Experience 1958-1987.

Potential Radioactive Contaminants and Possible Treatments\n\nRadioactive contaminants of immediate medical significance and possible treatments are listed in the following table.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix E Animal Efficacy Rule\n\nIn May 2002, FDA promulgated a rule allowing for approval of new drug products based on animal data when adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies in humans cannot be ethically conducted because the studies would involve administering a potentially lethal or permanently disabling toxic substance or organism to healthy human volunteers, and field trials are not\n\nFootnote 23: The Animal Efficacy Rule is codified in 21 CFR part 314, subpart I for human drug products.\n\nEmergencies may arise necessitating human use of a decorporation agent still under development and for which approval under the Animal Efficacy Rule is not immediately feasible. Should this situation arise, it is conceivable that the product could be used under FDA's investigational new drug regulations in 21 CFR part 312 or under the emergency use authorization provision in section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3).\n\nii.2.1 Applying the Animal Efficacy Rule to Decorporation Agents\n\nFor decorporation agents used to enhance elimination or excretion of absorbed radioactive contaminants, animal studies may be used to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness only when (1) there is a reasonably well-understood pathophysiologic mechanism of the toxicity of the radioactive contaminant and its elimination or excretion by the decorporation agent, (2) the effect is demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans, unless the effect is demonstrated in a single animal species that represents a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for predicting the response in humans, (3) the animal study endpoint is clearly related to the desired benefit in humans, and (4) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data or information in animals and humans are sufficient to allow selection of an effective dose in humans. It should be noted that animal efficacy studies are subject to the same good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements as animal toxicology studies (see Subsection III.D below).\n\nIn some situations, human efficacy studies using nontoxic levels of the radioactive contaminant or a stable, nonradioactive counterpart may be feasible and ethical. In such cases, approval could be based on efficacy standards described elsewhere in FDA's regulations, and evidence of effectiveness from animal studies alone would not be sufficient to support approval of a new product or a new indication for an already marketed product. Human efficacy studies would be needed to support marketing approval (see 21 CFR 314.600).\n\nEven if a new decorporation agent is eligible for approval under the Animal Efficacy Rule, that agent must still be evaluated for safety in humans; animal data is not sufficient to demonstrate safety (21 CFR 314.600). Products evaluated for effectiveness under the Animal Efficacy Rule must be evaluated for safety under preexisting requirements for establishing the safety of new drug products (21 CFR 314.600). FDA believes that the safety of these products (unlike their effectiveness) can be studied in human volunteers.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]\n\nalso the kinetics of the solution to solid (heterogeneous) exchange reaction. The synthetic procedure for manufacturing Prussian blue can produce insoluble solids of highly variable particle size, porosity, hydration, and defect impurities. In FDA's experience, it was important to consider the effects of all these factors on Prussian blue's cesium exchange properties.\n\nAnimal Efficacy Studies\n\nUnder the Animal Efficacy Rule, a sponsor can rely on animal studies to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for certain new drug products intended to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear substances. Under SSS 314.610(a)(2), one of the requirements for approval based on effectiveness data from animals alone is that the effect be demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans, unless the effect is demonstrated in a single animal species that represents a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for predicting the response in humans. Determination of the number of animal studies needed to support approval of a particular NDA will be made on a case-by-case basis, as will the determination of what constitutes a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for a given product or indication. In FDA's experience, animal efficacy studies found in the published literature or conducted without the express purpose of supporting regulatory submissions have often lacked adequate scientific rigor. Furthermore, unless there are sufficient pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic data to conclude that a rodent species will adequately predict the human response, FDA believes that the effectiveness of a proposed decorporation agent will need to be demonstrated in a second, probably nonrodent, animal species.\n\n1.1.1 Considerations Regarding Efficacy Studies Supporting Approval\n\nThe following considerations and study characteristics are important in designing and interpreting the animal studies that will be used to support product approval (this list is not comprehensive):\n\nEvaluation of efficacy in an appropriate animal species; the pharmacokinetic profile of the product and the distribution of the radioactive contaminant in the selected species should be similar to what is observed or expected in humans.\n--------------------\nContext title: Internal Radioactive Contamination \u2014Development of Decorporation Agents \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1968104839324951"], "With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nNonclinical Studies for the\n\nSafety Evaluation of\n\nPharmaceutical Excipients\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nMay 2005\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology\n\nChapter 6 Outdance for Industry\n\nNonclinical Studies for the\n\nSafety Evaluation of\n\nPharmaceutical Excipients\n\nAdditional copies are available from: Office of Training and Communications Division of Drug Information, HFD-240 Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 5600 Fishers Lane Rockville, MD 20857 (Tel) 301-827-4573 http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm or Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturers Assistance, HFM-40 Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-1448 (Tel) 800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800 http://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nMay 2005\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for\n\nBiological Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nNonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation\n\nof Pharmaceutical Excipients\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate\n\nnumber listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis document provides guidance concerning development of safety profiles to support use of\n\nnew excipients as components of drug or biological products. It is intended for use by reviewers\n\nwithin both the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics\n\nEvaluation and Research (CBER) and by interested individuals in industry. It is also intended to\n\nfoster and expedite the development of new excipients, communicate to pharmaceutical and\n\nexcipient manufacturers current CDER and CBER recommendations on the nonclinical safety\n\ndata that should be generated to support excipient development, and increase uniformity within\n\nCDER and CBER as to expectations for the nonclinical safety evaluation of excipients.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable\n\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should\n\nbe viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are\n\ncited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or\n\nrecommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nIn this guidance, the phrase new excipients means any inactive ingredients that are intentionally\n\nadded to therapeutic and diagnostic products, but that: (1) we believe are not intended to exert\n\ntherapeutic effects at the intended dosage, although they may act to improve product delivery\n\n(e.g., enhance absorption or control release of the drug substance); and (2) are not fully qualified\n\nby existing safety data with respect to the currently proposed level of exposure, duration of\n\nexposure, or route of administration. Examples of excipients include fillers, extenders, diluents,wetting agents, solvents, emulsifiers, preservatives, flavors, absorption enhancers, sustained-release matrices, and coloring agents. Within the context of this guidance, the term excipient applies to macromolecular substances such as albumin, or substances such as amino acids and sugars that are used in drug and biological products. It does not, however, apply to process or product-related impurities (e.g., degradation products, leachates, residual solvents) or extraneous contaminants.\n\nNot all excipients are inert substances; some have been shown to be potential toxicants. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the Act) was enacted after the tragedy of the elixir of sulfanilamide in 1937 in which an untested excipient was responsible for the death of many children who consumed the pharmaceutical. The Act required manufacturers to perform safety testing of pharmaceuticals and submit new drug applications (NDAs) demonstrating safety before marketing. Since that time, the Agency has become aware that certain other excipients used in commerce can cause serious toxicities in consumers of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products in the United States and other countries.\n\nThis guidance describes the types of toxicity data that the Agency uses in determining whether a potential new excipient is safe for use in human pharmaceuticals. It discusses recommended safety evaluations for excipients proposed for use in OTC and generic drug products, and describes testing strategies for pharmaceuticals proposed for short-term, intermediate, and long-term use. It also describes recommended excipient toxicity testing for pulmonary, injectable, and topical pharmaceuticals.\n\nIII Submission of safety data\n\nMost, if not all, drug products could not be made without the use of excipients. Tablets, capsules, suspensions, and others all require one or more excipients in their formulations. Excipients may also have functions, for example, in sustained release preparations or in enhancing drug penetration through the skin.\n\nIt is important to perform risk-benefit assessments on proposed new excipients in drug products and to establish permissible and safe limits for these substances. This requires evaluation of a safety database. With proper planning, however, it is often possible to assess the toxicology of an excipient in a relatively efficient manner. For example, sponsors can develop new excipients concurrently with safety evaluation of new drug and biological products by adding groups of animals that receive the excipient to studies that would have been conducted anyway to develop a drug substance. The Centers recognize that existing human data for some excipients can substitute for certain nonclinical safety data, and an excipient with documented prior human exposure under circumstances relevant to the proposed use may not require evaluation in the full battery of toxicology studies outlined in this guidance. For example, the Centers will continue to consider factors such as use in previously approved products or GRAS status as a direct food additive. Under some circumstances (e.g., similar route of administration, level of exposure, patient population, and duration of exposure) experience associated with the prior use may adequately qualify an excipient. However, it may be necessary for the safety database associated with that excipient to be brought up to current standards (e.g., submission of additional genetic toxicology data). The available information that supported the prior use will be considered in light of any proposed new use by the appropriate review division. It is important to note that the inclusion of an excipient in a USP/NF monograph or other non-FDA document is not an indication that the substance has been reviewed by the FDA and found safe for use.\n\nOver-the-Counter Products\n\nFor products marketed under OTC drug monographs, 21 CFR 330.1(e) requires: \"The product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays to determine if the product meets its professed standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity. Color additives may be used only in accordance with section 721 of the act and subchapter A of this chapter.\" It is the manufacturer's responsibility to comply with these requirements and to have appropriate supporting data in its files. The provisions of SS 330.1(e) do not apply to OTC products marketed under NDAs or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). Some excipients used in NDA-approved drug products may not be safe for use in OTC products (e.g., some toxic excipients used in cancer chemotherapeutics).\n\nGeneric Products\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.066126585006714", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: 1 Introduction\n\nThis document discusses several nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology issues that are inherent with the development of topical drugs that are intended to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or with the development of drugs proposed to act as vaginal contraceptives. It is not meant to replace existing guidance concerning the nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology safety data required to support the submission of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. Rather, it offers insight into some aspects of these classes of drugs that make them unique from systemically administered drugs, namely, the topical sites of their administration and action and the prophylactic nature of the indications. The publication of this document is a joint effort of three independent review divisions in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the FDA, and represents their best harmonized view of the issues at this time. However, all the recommendations contained herein may be subject to modification and sponsors are encouraged to discuss the content of their nonclinical submissions with the review division appropriate to each individual application\n\n2 Toxicology Studies\n\nTo support the safety of the individual phases of clinical development, studies in at least two animal species (one being a non-rodent) should be used to assess acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity at the proposed site of exposure. Potential sites of exposure to topical microbicides for the prevention of STDs include vaginal, cervical, penile, oral and rectal mucosal areas. For the purpose of this document, contraceptives are considered to expose vaginal and penile tissue. All toxicology studies should use at least three dose levels of the drug and an appropriate control, with the high dose showing frank toxicity (it is understood that there may be limits to the ability to achieve a toxic dose), and the low dose showing little or no toxicity. With the exception of the varying concentrations of the active product, the drug to be applied should be in its final formulation and the study duration should be equal to, or longer than, the proposed duration of treatment in the clinical trial. However, if in an early trial, the duration of treatment is for less than two weeks, a nonclinical study duration of two weeks should generally be used. All nonclinical studies carried out to assess safety of a drug should be performed according to Good Laboratory Practices as outlined in 21 CFR. 58. Sponsors should consult with the FDA reviewing pharmacologist concerning approaches and protocols regarding these issues.\n\nBecause the topical microbicides are intended for intermittent use during periods in which the individual will be at risk of contracting a STD and contraceptives are intended for intermittent use over long periods of reproductive competence, they are, for regulatory purposes, considered to be chronically administered drugs. Thus, in the latter stages of clinical development, six month studies in a rodent and one year toxicity studies in a non-rodent will be necessary to support phase 2/3 human trials. Carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice should be performed during the late stages of the drug development program.\n\nPharmacokine/Toxicokinetic Studies\n\nDuring the conduct of subchronic and chronic toxicity studies, concurrent pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic analyses should be performed to evaluate the drug's ADME (absorption, disposition, metabolism and excretion) profile and to determine if the drug is systemically absorbed. Appropriate analytical methodology should be established as early as possible to provide for precise, consistent and reliable pharmacokinetic data. Major pharmacokinetic endpoints such as maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration time curve, volume of distribution, bioavailability and clearance should be determined. To better assess margins of safety, the animal pharmacokinetic data should be compared with data in humans. For instance, a drug might be absorbed in humans and the vaginal route of delivery in animals cannot achieve much higher systemic drug levels than those seen in humans. In that case, a one to three-month toxicology study in one species, with parenteral or oral administration of the drug, may be requested to produce sufficiently high blood levels to identify all potential toxicities. If the drug is absorbed, histopathology should be carried out on the full spectrum of organs and tissues.\n\nIrritation\n\nThe likelihood of drug-induced irritation (adverse reactions such as inflammatory responses) to drug exposed tissues should be evaluated in animals at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Vaginal irritation tests should be carried out in rabbits with daily applications for ten days. If rabbits are adequately tested by the vaginal route for adverse effects in toxicology studies, no separate vaginal irritation study is required.\n\nIf the drug is found to be irritating to mucosal tissues and the sponsor decides to pursue further development, additional pharmacokinetics should be carried out to compare the extent of penetration of the drug across the inflamed tissue with that occurring in intact tissue. These data will help to determine whether the absorption kinetics of the drug is facilitated when the mucosa is compromised.\n\n4 Hypersensitivity and Photosensitivity\n\nIf appropriate, the potential to produce hypersensitivity and photosensitivity of the drug should be evaluated. Examples of animal models and protocols for tests related to these toxicities can be found in references such as Marzulli and Maibach's \"Dermatotoxicology\" or Burleson, Dean and Munson's \"Methods in Immunotoxicology.\"\n\n5 Genotoxicity\n\nA standard battery of tests should be carried out to evaluate all new molecular entities for the potential to induce genotoxic effects. A drug should be evaluated for potential genetic toxicity prior to the submission of the IND. The standard battery consists of the three following tests:\n\n1) A gene mutation test in bacteria;\n\n2) An in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assay or a mammalian cell in vitro cytogenetic test for chromosomal aberrations;\n\n3) An in vivo test for chromosomal damage to rodent bone marrow cells or a mouse micronucle test.\n\nIf the three tests chosen indicate that the drug is devoid of genetic toxicity, no additional studies need to be carried out. If one or more of the battery is positive, the sponsor will be expected to carry out additional genotoxicity tests in consultation with the appropriate review division. For detailed information regarding genotoxicity, sponsors should refer to the document entitled \"Guidance on Specific Aspects of Regulatory Genotoxicity Tests for Pharmacoeticals.\" Copies of the Guideline are available from the CDER Consumer Affairs Branch, HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\n6 Reproductive Toxicology\n\nReproductive toxicology studies should be carried out to explore the possible effects of the drug on fertility and reproductive performance. Additional studies should be performed to examine whether the drug is teratogenic or has an affect on perinatal/postnatal development. Studies designed to assess the teratogenic potential should be carried out in two species, usually in rats and rabbits. It is expected that reproductive toxicology studies will be completed prior to Phase 2/3 trials. For detailed information regarding reproductive toxicology, sponsors should refer to the document entitled, \"Guideline for Industry, Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products.\" Copies of the Guideline are available from the CDER Consumer Affairs Branch, HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\n5 Carcinogenicity\n\nCarcinogenicity information is usually obtained during the final phase of the clinical development program. For a vaginal contraceptive, carcinogenicity tests in rats and mice should be submitted with the NDA. For a microbicide, carcinogenicity studies are also required, but the expected date of completion of the studies in relation to the filing of the NDA may vary. The drug should be administered for two years and the doses used should be chosen according to the principles outlined in the document entitled, \"Guideline for Industry, Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals.\" Copies of the Guideline are available from the CDER Consumer Affairs Branch, HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Sponsors should consult with the appropriate reviewing division for the current position and strategic approaches to these issues. Currently, it is recommended that sponsors request that the Executive Committee of the Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research review the protocols for the carcinogenicity studies prior to their initiation and concur on their content.\n\n6 Already Marketed Drugs\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Development of Topical Drugs Intended to Prevent the Transmission of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) and:or for the Development of Drugs Intended to Act as Vaginal Contraceptives \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.197819709777832", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: Microdose\n\nRadopharmaceutical\n\nDiagnostic Drugs: Nonclinical Study Recommendations\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nAugust 2018\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors of microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs on the nonclinical studies recommended to support human clinical trials and marketing applications.2 This guidance addresses the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking regarding regulation of this class of drugs and provides complementary recommendations to the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers Exploratory IND (Investigational New Drug Application) Studies (exploratory IND guidance) and the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (ICH M3(R2)).\n\nFootnote 2: As defined by the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers Exploratory IND (Investigational New Drug Application) Studies, a microdose is less than 1/100 of the dose of a test substance calculated (based on animal data) to yield a pharmacologic effect of the test substance with a maximum dose of less than or equal to 100 micrograms ((\\upmu)g). The maximum dose for protein products is less than or equal to 30 nanomoles (nmol). This definition corresponds to approach 1 in Table 3: Recommended Nonclinical Studies to Support Exploratory Clinical Trials in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThis guidance discusses how to refine nonclinical study recommendations for this class of drug given its unique characteristics (e.g., microdose, radiolabeled, single (or infrequent) use, clinical use setting, the Agency's nonclinical and clinical safety experience with these drugs).\n\nThis guidance also is intended to help sponsors facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials, reduce the use of animals with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles, and reduce the use of drug development resources. While both the exploratory IND and the ICH M3(R2) guidancesdescribe recommended nonclinical studies intended to be conducted early in phase 1 exploratory studies of microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the guidances do not address what additional nonclinical studies are recommended for marketing approval. This guidance is intended to provide recommendations for a pathway to full drug development (marketing authorization) for microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs.\n\nAs used in this guidance, a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical drug is (1) a drug that is intended for use in the diagnosis or monitoring of a disease or a manifestation of a disease in humans and that exhibits spontaneous disintegration of unstable nuclei with the emission of nuclear particles or photons or (2) any nonradioactive kit or nuclide generator that is intended to be used in the preparation of such a drug.3 These drugs are used in nuclear medicine procedures, including planar imaging, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and in combination with other radiation detection probes. As technology advances, microdose drugs that use new modalities may emerge. Although this guidance describes recommendations for current radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the general principles discussed could apply to new diagnostic drugs.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 315 and 601.31.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to radioactive drugs for research that are used in accordance with 21 CFR 361.1.4 These issues are addressed in the guidance for industry and researchers The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application.\n\nFootnote 4: A radiolabeled compound without an IND can be administered at doses that are known to have no pharmacologic effect in humans when the compound has been studied in humans and the results of the studies have been published in the literature. These basic research studies should be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board and a radioactive research committee (21 CFR 361.1).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFor radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the microdose evaluated during early clinical trials does not differ significantly from the microdose intended for marketing approval and is less than or equal to 100 micrograms ((\\upmu)g). Because these diagnostic drugs are administered using a dose at the low end of the dose-response curve, dose-related adverse events are unlikely to occur. The Agency recommends that sponsors tailor the amount and type of nonclinical supporting data to account for the low potential for adverse events.\n\nBecause each drug is unique, the Agency encourages sponsors to consult the Division of Medical Imaging Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research before submitting an IND and during drug development. If, at any stage of development, a sponsor determines that particular nonclinical pharmacology or toxicology studies are not needed and provides adequate justification in a waiver request, the Agency may grant a waiver for specific studies.5\n\nFootnote 5: 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nIII Recommendations for Nonclinical Studies\n\nThe Agency recommends that the sponsor schedule the nonclinical studies to facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials (including appropriate safety monitoring based on findings in nonclinical studies) and to reduce unnecessary use of animals and other resources. Nonclinical recommendations for microdose diagnostic radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \\hline\nStudy Type & Phase & Comments \\ \\hline Pharmacology & Before phase 1 & These studies can include in vivo and in vitro pharmacologic characterizations (e.g., receptor/target/off-target profiling, imaging/radiation dosimetry studies). These studies should provide evidence that radiolabeling of an unlabeled moiety does not significantly alter pharmacologic characterizations. The studies should be of sufficient sensitivity to rule out pharmacologic effects at the anticipated clinical dose. \\ \\hline Extended single-dose toxicity in one species (usually a rodent) & Before phase 1 & FDA accepts the use of extended single-dose toxicity studies in animals to support single-dose clinical trials in humans. When a toxicity study is recommended, a sponsor can use a single mammalian species (both sexes). The route of exposure in animals should be the intended clinical route. To establish safety margins, the sponsor should use a formulation that is as similar as possible to the formulation intended for use in clinical trials for marketing approval.* \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIn extended single-dose studies, animals should be observed for 14 days after dosing with an interim necropsy, typically on day 2, and evaluated endpoints should include body weights, clinical signs, clinical chemistries, hematology, and histopathology (high dose and control only if no pathology is seen at the high dose). The sponsor should design the study to establish a dose inducing a minimal toxic effect or, alternatively, establishing a margin of safety. To establish a margin of safety, the sponsor should demonstrate that a large multiple of the proposed human dose (e.g., 100 times the human dose) does not induce adverse effects in the experimental animals. Scaling from animals to humans based on milligram per kilogram for IV or milligram per square meter for oral administration can be used to select the dose for use in the clinical trial. Scaling based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodeling would also be appropriate if such data are available and the suggested dose does not exceed the dose determined from milligram per kilogram or milligram per square meter scaling.\n--------------------\nContext title: Microdose Radiopharmaceutical Diagnostic Drugs- Nonclinical Study Recommendations Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.241405963897705", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.2.2 Pharmacology Toxicology\n\nSponsors of monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should consider the following pharmacology toxicology recommendations:\n\nThe Agency intends to be flexible regarding selected nonclinical safety data submission expectations (e.g., timing of data submission to the IND) for monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 to support clinical trial initiation. The degree of flexibility warranted will be influenced by the benefit-risk assessment for the intended population (e.g., hospitalized, nonhospitalized, healthy trial subjects) and the potential coverage of important emerging variants. Thus, FDA strongly recommends that sponsors discuss the nonclinical requirements to support product administration in a specific clinical trial with the Agency through the pre-IND consultation process.11 Footnote 11: See the guidance for industry and investigators COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: General Considerations for Pre-IND Meeting Requests for COVID-19 Related Drugs and Biological Products (May 2020).\n\nNonclinical safety assessment for monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should follow approaches outlined in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Delivered Pharmaceuticals (May 2012) and conduct the following:\n\nA tissue cross reactivity (TCR) study using a panel of human tissues.12 When a monoclonal antibody binds to human tissues in the TCR study, FDA recommends evaluating monoclonal antibody binding to select tissues from nonclinical species to assist in species selection for repeat-dose toxicology testing. When binding of potential clinical concern is observed (e.g., cell membrane binding), FDA\nrecommends discussing these data with the Agency because additional studies may be needed to help inform the potential clinical relevance of the findings. * A short duration (i.e., 3 weeks of treatment) repeat-dose toxicology study in a single species, using the clinical formulation and route of administration(s) intended for clinical administration, that includes all standard toxicity endpoints including toxicokinetic analysis. FDA also recommends discussing specific study design considerations with the Agency.\n\nToxicology studies with specific monoclonal antibody combinations are not needed for monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins, so monoclonal antibody products can be evaluated separately in toxicology studies. If a sponsor evaluates monoclonal antibody products in combination, FDA recommends using the same ratio intended for clinical administration.\n\nTo support administration of monoclonal antibody products during pregnancy, FDA recommends conducting a TCR study using relevant human tissues or studies using alternative protein interaction technologies, with appropriate justification. If no specific concerns are identified in the repeat-dose toxicology and TCR studies, developmental and reproductive toxicology studies are not needed.\n\n3.1.3 Virology\n\nSponsors of monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should consider the following virology recommendations:\n\nA broad approach should initially be used to characterize the impact of amino acid changes, insertions, or deletions throughout the monoclonal antibody target protein to identify regions where changes specifically impact monoclonal antibody binding or activity, and subsequent analyses and surveillance can focus on these regions.\n\nSponsors should monitor SARS-CoV-2 genomic databases continually for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and should evaluate phenotypically any specific variants that are prevalent or becoming prevalent that harbor substitutions in or near the target epitope. The sponsor should conduct a more thorough analysis to include other substitutions at the same amino acid positions.\n\nSponsors should characterize the epitopes to which monoclonal antibody products bind to enable identification of polymorphisms, which may affect binding, and to inform decisions regarding monoclonal antibody products planned for use in a combination therapy.\n\nSponsors should characterize monoclonal antibody products with respect to epitope binding (affinity equilibrium dissociation constant (K({}_{\\text{D}})) and noncompetitive binding). The sponsor should characterize the mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (e.g., blocking spike protein/receptor binding domain interaction with ACE2).\n\nThe sponsor should determine the neutralizing activity (half maximal effective concentration (EC({}_{50})) value) of investigational monoclonal antibody products, individually and if applicable in combination, against an array of circulating variants representing the diversity of the target protein and epitope to which the monoclonal antibody binds.\n\nThe sponsor should evaluate the neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies, individually and if applicable in combination, against SARS-CoV-2 variants or pseudovirus harboring substitutions known to confer reduced susceptibility to other authorized or approved antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 or pseudovirus should be serially passaged in cell culture in the presence of the monoclonal antibody product, individually and if applicable in combination, to select for resistant variants to understand the potential risk and nature of treatment-emergent resistance. Sponsors should characterize genotypically and phenotypically the variants selected in this manner. Sponsors should determine the effect of resistance-associated substitutions on approved and authorized monoclonal antibody products. These studies should be conducted under appropriate biocontainment.13 Footnote 13: For biosafety considerations from the National Institutes of Health, which may be relevant for some research, see the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules and the FAQs \u2014 Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidance for Research with SARS-CoV-2 and IBC Requirements under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules available at https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/nih-guidelines/. See also the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s guideline Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories available at https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL_html.\n\nClinical protocols should include detailed plans to (1) characterize the impact of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability on clinical and virologic outcomes (i.e., baseline resistance analyses) and (2) identify SARS-CoV-2 genetic changes associated with treatment (i.e., treatment-emergent resistance analyses).\n\nSponsors should also reference the guidance for industry COVID-19: Developing Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention (February 2021) and the guidance for industry Antiviral Product Development -- Conducting and Submitting Virology Studies to the Agency (June 2006).\n\nClinical Sponsors of monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should consider the following clinical recommendations:\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]\n--------------------\nContext title: Development of Monoclonal Antibody Products Targeting SARS-CoV-2, Including Addressing the Impact of Emerging Variants, During the COVID 19 Public Health Emergency\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.441751003265381", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: Further nonclinical studies might not add value when the existing pharmacology information has already identified a particular hazard unless a more detailed understanding of the dose-response relationship or differences in sensitivity between adult and juvenile animals is warranted.\n\n2.3.3 Pharmacokine Data (WoE Factors: Amount/Type of Existing Data)\n\nMaturation of systems important for ADME such as the gastrointestinal, liver and renal systems can result in rapidly changing systemic exposures in humans and in animals, leading to potential age-related differences in efficacy and toxicity. In humans, these differences are usually most prominent in neonates and infants.\n\nClinical pharmacology and modelling and simulation tools are considered useful to contribute information on the pharmacokinetics, and also pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of a drug in paediatric subjects (see ICH E11). In general, a JAS is not informative in predicting or recapitulating age-related differences in human ADME.\n\n3.4 Nonclinical Safety Data (WoE Factors: Effects on Developing Organ Systems; Amount/Type of Existing Data)\n\nExisting nonclinical data should be evaluated for findings that could indicate potential effects in organs undergoing development in paediatric subjects. Findings occurring in animals at similar exposures as those likely to be achieved in paediatric subjects are of increased concern, particularly if the findings occur in organs/tissues that undergo critical postnatal development at the intended paediatric age (see Appendix A). Safety signals in adult animals in more than one species are of increased concern. It can still be appropriate to evaluate the potential impact on paediatric subjects of a toxicity that occurred in adult animals that did not translate to adverse effects in adult humans if the target organ/system is undergoing development in the relevant paediatric population. Depending on the age of the animals at initiation of dosing and the endpoints included, some of these concerns may have been addressed in existing toxicity studies.\n\nGenotoxicity testing and safety pharmacology investigations are normally conducted to support adult clinical trials and, therefore, should be available before paediatric clinical trials commence. If a safety pharmacology study shows an effect in an organ system undergoing structural or functional development and maturation in the intended paediatric patient population, the possible impact of the effect should be considered. Additional genotoxicity and safety pharmacology assessments in juvenile animals are generally not appropriate to support paediatric indications.\n--------------------\nContext title: S11_Step4_FinalGuideline_2020_0310\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.672757625579834", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: This document does not address the content of an application file. For content questions, refer to regional guidance.\n\n2 General Issues\n\nSeparate or Repeated Sections\n\nThere can be a number of instances where repeated sections can be considered appropriate. Whenever a section is repeated, it should be made clear what the section refers to by creating a distinguishing title in parentheses following the CTD-Q heading, for example, 2.3.S Drug Substance (Name, Manufacturer A).\n\nDrug Substance\n\nWhen more than one drug substance is used in a drug product, information should be presented separately as one complete Drug Substance section followed by other complete Drug Substance sections. In some cases, for a single drug substance, it could be considered appropriate and logical to have information presented in multiple Drug Substance sections. For example, separate sections can be warranted when a single drug substance is made at two different manufacturing sites with differences in the manufacturing processes. However, despite these differences, it is likely that these different processes will be described within the same relevant subsection of 3.2.S. If, on the other hand, the differences result in, for example, different specifications, then adding an additional Drug Substance section is recommended (see also regional guidance).\n\nDrug Product\n\nDepending upon regional requirements, different drug product presentations (e.g., strengths, container closure types and configurations, formulations) and/ or manufacturing schemes (e.g., aseptic and terminal sterilization) can be submitted in the same dossier. In general, when a single dossier can be submitted, information for each of the product presentations and manufacturing schemes should be combined and presented together in one Drug Product section, with information for each of the product presentations and manufacturing schemes provided in the Appendices and Regional Information sections, as warranted. For example, if 100 milligram (mg) tablets will be marketed in a bottle and a unit-dose blister package, the information should be presented in one Drug Product section. Where most of the quality information would be identical for the two drug products, the data common to both presentations should appear only once. The information that differs between the two should be presented as separate documents under the appropriate subsections (e.g., 3.2.P.7 Container Closure System, 3.2.P.8 Stability).\n--------------------\nContext title: M4Q_Q&As_R1_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.846077919006348"], "When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nPreface\n\nSince the ICH Q7 Guidance was finalised, experience with implementing the guidance worldwide has given rise to requests for clarification of uncertainties due to the interpretation of certain sections. This Question and Answer (Q&A) document is intended to respond to those requests.\n\nThe ICH Q7 document should be read in its entirety regardless of the nature of the manufacturing activities being conducted to fully understand the linkages between certain sections and successfully implement appropriate Good Manufacturing practices (GMPs) at all stages of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) supply chain, including distribution. A table is provided as an Annex of this document showing the link between each Q&A and the relevant Sections of ICH Q7 and other ICH Quality guidance.\n\nICH would like to acknowledge the work undertaken by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S). PIC/S contributed to this document by selecting and reviewing relevant Q&As that had been collected from training sessions since the implementation of Q7 and transferred the output of these reviews to the ICH Q7 IWG for consideration and consolidation, as appropriate. Additional questions were developed based on responses from an ICH survey. PIC/S further contributed to the development of the document as an ICH Interested Party.\n\nPlease note that ICH Q7 should be applied in combination with the principles laid down for development and manufacturing in ICH Q11 (see definition of API starting material; see also ICH Q8(R2) Part II), Quality Risk Management (ICH Q9), and Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10). GMP principles as described in ICH Q7 should be applied regardless which approach is taken in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.\n\nICH Q7 also describes principles of GMPs to be applied in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials (Section 19) and for APIs manufactured by cell culture/fermentation (Section 18).\n\nDated: 10 June 2015\n\n1 INTRODUCTION - SCOPE\n\n1.2 & June 2015 & Does ICH Q7 apply to manufacturing Steps for the addition of substance(s) to an API (e.g., to stabilise the API)? & When a mixture is classified in the regulatory filing as an API in a region or country in which it is used in a drug product, ICH Q7 should be applied to the manufacturing of these mixtures [ICH Q7, Section 1.2, 20 - see Glossary for definition of 'API'].\n\n2 QUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\n3.

However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.5412211418151855", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARMONISATION OF TECHICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE\n\nICH HARMONISED TRIPARTITE GUIDELINE\n\nGood Manufacturing Practice Guide for\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nQ7\n\nCurrent Step 4 version\n\ndated 10 November 2000\n\nThis Guideline has been developed by the appropriate ICH Expert Working Group and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH Process.

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide \"manufacturing\" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term \"should\" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms \"current good manufacturing practices\" and \"good manufacturing practices\" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.2113988399505615", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nBackground and Objectives\n\nDevelopment process\n\nScope/ Content\n\nRegulatory implementation\n\nKey message\n\nSummary\n\nFirst internationally harmonized Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidance developed jointly by industry and regulators under the ICH umbrella\n\nFinalized November 2000 and adopted by most major Health Authorities including WHO\n\nEstablishes one global GMP guideline for Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (APIs)\n\nIntended to facilitate API inspections\n\nImportant to international cooperative regulation of API manufacturing* ICH Q7 was published in 2000\n\nAPI manufacturing technology and practices have evolved since then\n\nGood Distribution Practice (GDP) for API was included in ICH Q7\n\nAPI supply chains are global and complex\n\nCurrently, many different health authorities regulate and/or inspect API manufacturers\n\nRegulators continue to find significant GMP deficiencies during API inspections\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n*Questions were obtained from various sources\n\nIncluding existing Q&As from the PIC/S API Expert Circle, PDA/ Regulatory training 2002\n\nSurvey of constituencies for issues needing clarification conducted by the ICH Q7 IWG Feb.- Mar. 2013\n\nIWG** * Evaluated about 200 questions and suggested answers * Consolidated, drafted, revised Q&As as needed * 5 face-to-face meetings and several regional and worldwide teleconferences * Consensus on 55 Q&As achieved on April 20, 2015\n\nThe Step 4 ICH harmonised document was posted to ICH website (www.ich.org) on 10 June 2015\n\nQuestions cover all sections of ICH Q7 except Section 9 (Packaging and Identification Labelling of APIs/ Intermediates)\n\nICH Q7 sections with the most Q&As were: Quality Management Materials Management Process Equipment Laboratory Controls\n\nQ&As include references to other ICH guidelines, including to Q8, Q9, Q10 and Q11 which were established after Q7 was finalised in 2000.\n\n2.

The guidance discusses some of the considerations for the noninferiority trial to ensure the appropriate demonstration of efficacy when compared to an active-controlled drug.\n\nEffective treatment of some NTDs includes the use of combinations of antimicrobial drugs to enhance efficacy or prevent the development of resistant pathogens. Some development programs may include two or more new investigational drugs. The guidance for industry Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination covers this area.\n\nSome NTDs have known effective treatment, and clinical trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of an investigational drug to the control drug can be used in this situation. The noninferiority clinical trial design poses some unique scientific and regulatory challenges, which focus on an ability to describe a reliable treatment effect of the control drug.

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.652435779571533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.622267246246338", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: In the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject's LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, \"Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA\u2019s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n\nTraditionally, informed consent has been obtained and documented in a face-to-face interview using paper consent forms. Technologies are available that may serve as an alternative to the paper consent form in the informed consent process.47 Parties interested in pursuing alternative methods of obtaining informed consent should discuss their plan with their IRB and are welcome to contact FDA as needed for advice.48\n\nFootnote 48: Questions related to alternative methods of obtaining informed consent can be directed to the Office of Clinical Policy at gcpaquestions@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nEven in the context of paper consent forms, there may be certain circumstances when an alternative to a face-to-face consent discussion may be appropriate. For example, such an alternative may be appropriate\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]\n\nbe described and noted in subject case histories required to maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).\n\niv.1.3 Requirement for Dating Consent Form\n\nIn addition to signing the consent form, the subject or the subject's LAR must enter the date of signature on the form (21 CFR 50.27(a)) to allow confirmation that the subject or the subject's LAR provided consent prior to participation in the clinical investigation, as required by 21 CFR 50.20. In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject's case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject's case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject's copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, \u201cCoercion and Undue Influence\u201d.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject's LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject's LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\u201d and Frequently Asked Question #7, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\u201d In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?\u201d, Frequently Asked Question #4, \u201cWhat process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?\u201d, and Frequently Asked Question #5, \u201cWhat process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?\u201d\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject's LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: \u201cThe fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the \u2018form\u2019 provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.\u201d\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject's consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject's questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject's LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.7337743043899536", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: III FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n\nNo informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.\n\nii.2.1 Exceptions to Informed Consent\n\nInformed consent is required for participation in FDA-regulated clinical investigations except under limited circumstances as described in 21 CFR 50.23 (involving certain life-threatening situations, military operations, or public health emergencies) and 21 CFR 50.24 (involving emergency research16) (see 21 CFR 50.20). We note that, to implement statutory changes made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) Act by section 3024 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), FDA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would allow IRBs responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of clinical investigations to approve an informed consent procedure that waives or alters certain informed consent elements or that waives the requirement to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations.17({}^{,})18 In addition, FDA issued guidance explaining that until the Agency promulgates regulations implementing the Cures Act amendments to the FD&C Act, FDA does not intend to object to an IRB approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or to an IRB waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations under the circumstances described in the guidance.19 Nothing in FDA's informed consent regulations is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law (21 CFR 50.25(e)).\n\nFootnote 16: See \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 17: See section 3024 of the Cures Act, Pub. L. 114-255, available at https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ255/PLAW-114publ255.pdf.\n\nFootnote 18: See \u201cInstitutional Review Board Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent for Minimal Risk Clinical Investigations,\u201d (83 FR 57378, November 15, 2018) at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-11-15/pdf/2018-24822.pdf.\n\nii.2.2 Coercion and Undue Influence\n\nThe conditions under which informed consent is sought and the relationship between the subject and the person obtaining consent should be carefully considered to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence (21 CFR 50.20). According to the Belmont Report, \"Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue influence,by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance.\"20\n\nFootnote 20: The Belmont Report was written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Commission, created as a result of the National Research Act of 1974, was charged with identifying the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. See Belmont Report, available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html.\n\nFor example, if an employer seeks to enroll employees in a clinical investigation sponsored or conducted by the employer, the informed consent process should contain safeguards to ensure that participation is voluntary and that the possibility of undue influence or coercion by supervisors, peers, or others is minimized. Similarly, because of a potential conflict of interest and the nature of the physician-patient relationship,21 when the investigator is also the prospective subject's physician, for example, the-investigator should ensure that the prospective subject understands that enrollment in the clinical investigation is voluntary, and that a decision to forgo enrollment will not adversely affect their medical care, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(a)(8). The consent process and form should emphasize that an individual's participation is truly voluntary.\n\nNote that coercion and undue influence may be situational, and can affect any population, not just subject populations seen as vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. For example, in a clinical investigation involving the collection of extra tissue samples during a planned surgical procedure, waiting to obtain informed consent until the prospective subject is in the preoperative area would generally fail to minimize the possibility of undue influence. The possibility of undue influence could be addressed by first discussing the study with the prospective subject during a preoperative visit as part of the informed consent process. The prospective subject could be told that the study will be reviewed with them again prior to the procedure and, after all questions are resolved, they will be asked to sign a consent form acknowledging their willingness to participate in the study at that time.\n\nIn addition, statements that claim investigational drugs and devices are safe or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated are prohibited (21 CFR 312.7(a) and 21 CFR 812.7(d)). Likewise, statements that overstate the possibility of benefit may unduly influence prospective subjects by leading them to incorrectly assume that it is known that the investigational product will be of benefit to them, influencing them to agree to participate when they might not have otherwise chosen to do so. For example, wording that refers to the clinical investigation as a \"therapeutic trial\" could contribute to a prospective subject's misunderstanding that the trial will offer a direct benefit for their disease or condition.\n\nFurthermore, we generally recommend against including statements such as \"FDA has given permission for the clinical investigation to proceed\" or \"FDA has approved the clinical investigation\" in the informed consent process, because such statements may suggest to subjects that the investigation has FDA's endorsement. In addition, these statements may not be accurate for the particular clinical investigation at issue (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.40(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\nFDA does not consider reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to and from the clinical trial site (e.g., airfare, gas, tolls), and associated costs, such as parking and lodging, to raise issues related to coercion or undue influence. Reimbursement for other expenses may be considered by an IRB on a case-by-case basis, and IRBs should consider whether the proposed remuneration could be an undue influence. Payment for participation in research should be just and fair. This topic is also discussed under sectionIII.2.3, \"Benefits.\"\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3012157678604126", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 58: See 21 CFR 56.109(b).\n\nInvestigators must use an IRB-approved written consent form when documenting informed consent, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27, except as provided in 21 CFR 56.109(c). Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, \"General Requirements for Informed Consent\" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD. Improving comprehension for cancer patients with low literacy skills: strategies for clinicians. CA Cancer J Clin. 1998 May-Jun;48(3):151-62. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.48.3.151. PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n\nThe investigator should notify the IRB of the consent process to be used. The process may be described in the protocol, or the investigator may provide a brief document describing the process to be used. The materials and procedures used for subject recruitment, which typically include advertisements, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB to ensure that these materials are appropriate, as described in section4.1, \"Review of All Informed Consent Materials\" (see 21 CFR 56.109(b) and 56.111(a)(4)).60 The IRB must determine that investigators will seek consent from prospective subjects under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). FDA considers this to include ensuring that the consent process described by the investigator allows sufficient time for prospective subjects to consider the information, provides time and opportunity for the subjects to ask questions and have those questions answered, and allows time and opportunity for the subjects to consider fully whether to participate.\n\nFootnote 60: For further information, see the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects.\n\nTo approve a clinical investigation, the IRB must find that informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's LAR and that informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4) and (5)). FDA recommends that the IRB inquire as to who will conduct the consent discussion and what procedures will be followed. If procedures other than a face-to-face consent discussion are proposed, such as by telephone, the IRB should consider whether the procedures will provide effective communication and accomplish the goals of the informed consent process. Alternative procedures may be of special concern when the clinical investigation involves complex procedures or when risks may be difficult to comprehend.\n\nFDA regulations authorize the IRB to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as well as the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should consider using this authority when it may be appropriate61 or enhance the protection provided to subjects (for example, when the investigator is alsothe treating physician for a prospective subject, when the person conducting the consent interview is relatively inexperienced, or when the clinical investigation involves vulnerable subjects). In addition to observing a sample of consent discussions, the IRB could interview subjects to assess the consent process and evaluate the subjects' understanding of the clinical investigation.\n\n3.3.3 IRB Review of Updated Informed Consent Documents\n\nAll information given to subjects as part of the consent process is to be reviewed and approved by the IRB (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).62 During the clinical investigation, new information about the research or changes to the clinical investigation may arise that affect the rights or welfare of subjects. FDA recommends that IRBs have procedures in place for the timely, efficient, and effective review of such new information or changes. This would include procedures for the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to notify the IRB of any significant new findings that arise during the clinical investigation relevant to a subject's decision to continue participation (see section3.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects\", and (\\mathtt{Frequently\\ Asked\\ Question}#16)). When new information or changes in the clinical investigation warrant revisions of the consent form (and any accompanying changes to the protocol), such revisions must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before the revisions are initiated, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)-(4)).\n\nFootnote 62: This would include all addenda to the consent form and other materials used in the consent process.\n\nSome changes may be reviewed and approved by expedited means, as provided for by 21 CFR 56.110. For example, an IRB may decide expedited review is appropriate for changes to the consent form that reflect minor changes in the protocol or recruitment plan (e.g., new advertising for subjects following initiation of the clinical investigation when the advertisement incorporates wording from the approved consent form). When expedited review is used, if the IRB reviewer is unsure whether the change qualifies for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110(b), FDA recommends that the reviewer (if other than the IRB chair) consult with the IRB chair. If doubts persist as to whether the change qualifies for expedited review, then the change should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB.63\n\nFootnote 63: As indicated at section4.2, when new information is added to the consent form that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research.\n\nAdministrative changes, such as the correction of typographical and spelling errors, and changes in telephone numbers, may be submitted to the IRB at any time, including during continuing review, and do not require formal review and approval. Although such changes do not need IRB review, updatedversions of the consent form should be sent to the IRB so that they have current copies of the informed consent form on file.64\n\nFootnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.8976002335548401", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to stakeholder inquiries, we are clarifying that the provisions of the 2018 Requirements related to the content, organization, and presentation of information included in the consent form and process as well as the basic and additional elements of informed consent are not inconsistent with FDA's current policies and guidances. This may avoid the need for sponsors or investigators to develop, and IRBs to review, two separate informed consent forms. See Appendix for a subset of the new informed consent provisions from the 2018 Requirements.\n\n4 Expedited Review Procedures and List\n\nFDA's regulation at 21 CFR 56.110 sets forth expedited IRB review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk. Section 56.110(a) describes a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by an IRB through an expedited review procedure that may be established through a Federal Register Notice. FDA established and published this list in the Federal Register on November 9, 1998 (the 1998 list).8 Section 56.110(b) makes clear that, as appropriate, IRB \"reviewer(s)\" must find that the research on the list involves no more than minimal risk in order for the IRB to use the expedited review procedure.\n\nFootnote 8: 63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998; https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-11-09/pdf/98-29748.pdf.\n\nFDA recognizes that under the 2018 Requirements at 45 CFR 46.110(b), an IRB may use the expedited procedures for research appearing on the expedited review list, unless the IRB reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk. Because FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with FDA's regulation at 21 CFR 56.110(b) and use the 1998 list for FDA-regulated clinical investigations, including those that are subject to both HHS and FDA regulations.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV IRB Continuing Review\n\nThe 2018 Requirements eliminated the requirement to conduct continuing review in certain circumstances (see 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)). Under 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)(i) and (iii), continuing review will not be required for research that is either eligible for expedited review in accordance with 45 CFR 46.110, or for research that has progressed to the point that the only remaining activities are data analysis, and/or accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care, unless the IRB determines otherwise.\n\nBecause FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with our current requirements for IRB continuing review at 21 CFR 56.109(f), including for clinical investigations that are subject to both HHS and FDA jurisdiction. IRBs are required to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)).9\n\nFootnote 9: For further information, see FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; IRB Continuing Review after Clinical Investigation Approval,\u201d (February 2012),\n\n(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm294558.pdf).\n\nVI Further Clarification\n\nFDA is actively working to harmonize its human subject protection regulations consistent with the Cures Act. We recognize there may be questions regarding the application of other provisions of the 2018 Requirements to FDA-regulated clinical investigations during this interim period. Questions and/or comments requesting further clarification may be submitted at any time to the public docket for this guidance, and FDA will consider issuing additional guidance, if necessary, to address other provisions.\n\nAppendix: Selected Informed Consent provisions from the 2018 requirements\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain new general requirements for informed consent related to the content, organization, and presentation of information in the consent form and process to facilitate a prospective subject's decision about whether to participate in the research.\n\nThe provisions which are new or include new information are as follows:\n\n46.116(a)(4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.\n\n46.117(b)(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the required elements of informed consent required by 45 CFR 46.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative and that the key information required by 45 CFR 46.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided.\n\nBasic and Additional Elements of Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain a new basic element and three additional elements of informed consent, as follows:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNew Basic Element at 45 CFR 46.116(b)(9)\n\nOne of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens:10\n\nFootnote 10: Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record). (45 CFR 46.102(e)(4)).\n\n(i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecicmens could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this might be a possibility; or (ii) A statement that the subject's information or biospecicmens collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies.\n\nNew Additional Elements at 45 CFR 46.116(c)(7) - (9)\n\n46.116(c)(7) A statement that the subject's biospecicmens (even if identifiers are removed) may be used for commercial profit and whether the subject will or will not share in this commercial profit; 46.116(c)(8) A statement regarding whether clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions; and 46.116(c)(9) For research involving biospecicmens, whether the research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing (i.e., sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or exome sequence of that specimen).\n--------------------\nContext title: Impact of Certain Provisions of the Revised Common Rule on FDA-Regulated Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.8663637638092041"], "According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Interpretation of the \"Deed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nDecember 2018\n\nProceduralInterpretation of the \"Deed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{th}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: occod@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guida\n\nnces/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nDecember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInterpretation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the\n\nBiologicals Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for\n\nBiologicals Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or\n\nAgency) on this topic.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff\n\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's interpretation of the provision of the Biologic's Price Competition\n\nand Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) under which an application for a biological product\n\napproved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21\n\nU.S.C. 355) as of March 23, 2020, will be deemed to be a license for the biological product\n\nunder section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262) on March 23, 2020. Specifically, this guidance describes FDA's interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\"\n\nprovision in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act for biological products that are approved under\n\nsection 505 of the FD&C Act as of March 23, 2020 (the transition date). This guidance also\n\nprovides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in\n\nan application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or\n\nbefore March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nAlthough the majority of therapeutic biological products have been licensed under section 351 of\n\nthe PHS Act, some protein products historically have been approved under section 505 of the\n\nFD&C Act (see the Appendix to this guidance for examples of such products). On March 23,\n\n2010, the BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n(Public Law 111-148). The BPCI Act clarified the statutory authority under which certain\n\nprotein products will be regulated by amending the definition of a \"biological product\"2 in\n\nsection 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a \"protein (except any chemically synthesizedpolypeptide),\"3 and describing procedures for submission of a marketing application for certain biological products.\n\nFootnote 3: FDA has described its interpretation of the statutory terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cchemically synthesized polypeptide\u201d in the amended definition of \u201cbiological product\u201d in guidance. See draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic. FDA\u2019s guidances for industry are available on the FDA Drugs guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs web guidance page. In addition, in the Federal Register of December 12, 2018, FDA also has issued a proposed rule to amend its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cchemically synthesized polypeptide.\u201d When final, this regulation will codify FDA\u2019s interpretation of these terms.\n\nThe BPCI Act requires that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act; this requirement is subject to certain exceptions during a 10-year transition period ending on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(1)-(3) and (e)(5) of the BPCI Act and section II of this guidance). On March 23, 2020 (i.e., the transition date), an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (see section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act). This guidance sets forth FDA's current interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the \"Hatch-Waxman Amendments\"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system such as a microorganism, or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines \"biosimilarity\" to mean that \"the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for \"interchangeability,\" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nThe BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.810235500335693", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule \u201cRequirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products\u201d (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule \u201cContent and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling\u201d (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095\u201396).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.37866365909576416", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: III Scope\n\nThis guidance applies to certain biological products licensed under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). This guidance applies to all manufacturing locations, including contract locations. Licensed biological products that are within the scope of this guidance include:\n\nVaccines;\n\nAllergenic products;\n\nPlasma-derived products e.g., albumin, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, fibrin sealants, proteinase inhibitors, etc.); and their recombinant analogs;\n\nAntitoxins, antivenins, and venoms;\n\nNaturally-derived (i.e., not recombinant) protein products (e.g., naturally-derived enzymes and certain toxins);\n\nCellular and gene therapy products;3 Footnote 3: For purposes of this guidance, the term \u201cgene therapy products\u201d includes cell-based gene therapies. Cellular therapy products include tissue-engineered products regulated under section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nIn vitro diagnostics (IVDs) regulated under the PHS Act (e.g., blood donor screening assays, etc.); and\n\nOther biological products licensed under the PHS Act subject to exceptions listed below.\n\nThis guidance also applies to combination products licensed under a BLA, unless the biological product constituent part is a specified biological product described in 21 CFR 601.2(a) or is otherwise outside the scope of this guidance, as described below. Biological products that are not within the scope of this guidance include:\n\nWhole Blood, blood components (including Source Plasma) and Source Leukocytes (Ref. 4);\n\nSpecified biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2(a);4 and\n\nBiosimilar and interchangeable products subject to licensure under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)).\n\nThis guidance also does not apply to human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264) and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to changes to an applicant's name. Such submissions are handled separately as product correspondence, in accordance with established procedures. For example, see CBER's Standard Operating Policy and Procedure (SOPP) 8403: Issuance and Reissuance of Licenses for Biological Products for further information on name changes.5\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome manufacturing changes discussed in this guidance may also require revision of the approved labeling (Ref. [6]). Such changes are outside the scope of this guidance. In general, under 21 CFR 601.12(f):\n\nLabeling changes requiring supplement submission and FDA approval before distribution of the product with the labeling change include any change in the package insert, package label, or container label, including information required under 21 CFR 201.57(a), or, if applicable a Medication Guide required under 21 CFR Part 208, except those described in 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2) and [3];6 Footnote 6: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(1). See also FDA guidance on \u201cThe \u2018Deemed To Be a License\u2019 Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers\u201d (March 2020), available at https://www.fda.gov/media/119274/download/ (recommending submission of a prior approval supplement for BLA-specific labeling changes for deemed BLAs). [7] 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2). [8] 21 CFR 601.12(f)(3).\n\nLabeling changes that require supplement submission and FDA approval, but which do not require FDA approval of the supplement before the product with the labeling change may be distributed, include certain safety-related labeling changes to the package insert, package label, or container label to reflect newly acquired information, or any other labeling change that FDA specifically requests to be submitted in a changes being effected supplement under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2)(i)(E);7 Footnote 7: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2).\n\nLabeling changes requiring submission in an annual report include changes to any final printed package insert, package label, container label, or Medication Guide required under 21 CFR Part 208 include, among other things, editorial or similar minor changes and changes in the information on how the product is supplied that does not involve a change in the dosage strength or dosage form.8 Footnote 8: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(3).\n\nFor manufacturing changes that impact labeling, reporting classification is generally commensurate with the risks of the manufacturing change. If the reporting classification recommendations are unclear for submissions that include both manufacturing and labeling changes, license holders are advised to consult with the appropriate FDA Review Division.\n\nDuring the finalization of this FDA guidance, the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) published Q12 Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management (see also the associated Annex) (Ref. [7]). The ICH Q12 guidance describes certainterminologies and concepts, including Established Conditions,9 that may impact how an applicant reports post-approval changes. The ICH Q12 guidance, should be used by applicants in concert with any other applicable FDA guidance to report post-approval changes to the Agency when such reporting is required by the statute and regulation.\n\nFootnote 9: Established Conditions are defined by the FDA as the description of the product, manufacturing process, facilities and equipment, and elements of the associated control strategy, as defined in an application, that assure process performance and quality of an approved product, and that can be specifically identified and proposed by the sponsor and approved as part of a BLA. Changes to the established conditions must be reported to FDA (21 CFR 601.12).\n\nIV Reporting Changes\n\nReporting Categories\n\nUnder 21 CFR 601.12, each post-approval change in the product, production process, quality controls, equipment, facilities, responsible personnel, or labeling established in the approved BLA must be reported using the submission type associated with one of the three tier-based reporting categories depending upon the potential (i.e., risk) of the change to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product (i.e., a substantial potential, moderate potential, or minimal potential). The reporting categories in this regulatory provision also specify when the product made using the change can be distributed. The submission types and associated reporting categories are as follows:\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS) - Changes that have a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., major changes) require an applicant to report the change to the FDA in a supplement to the approved BLA. A PAS must be approved by the FDA prior to distribution of the product manufactured using the change (21 CFR 601.12(b)).\n\nChanges Being Effected in 30 Days/Changes Being Effected Supplements10 (CBE30/CBE) - Changes that have a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., moderate changes) require an applicant to report the change to the FDA in a supplement at least 30 days prior to distribution of the product made using the change (21 CFR 601.12(c)). In certain circumstances, the FDA may determine that, based on the Agency's experience with a particular type of moderate change, the supplement for such a change is complete and provides the proper information and particular assurances that the change has been appropriately submitted. The product made using such a change may be distributed immediately upon receipt of the supplement by the FDA (21 CFR 601.12(c)(5)). These circumstances may include substantial similarity with a type of change that ordinarily involves a CBE supplement or a situation in which the applicant presents evidence that the change has been validated in accordance with an approved comparability protocol (CP) under 21 CFR 601.12(c) and 21 CFR 601.12(e).\n\nFootnote 10: This paragraph refers to CBE supplements submitted under 21 CFR 601.12(c), and does not refer to CBE supplements for certain types of labeling changes submitted under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2).\n\nAnnual Report (AR) - Changes that have a minimal potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., minor changes) shall be documented by the applicant in an annual report (21 CFR 601.12(d)).\n\nAssessing and Implementing Manufacturing Changes\n\nApplicant Assessment and Implementation of Change\n\nThe potential for a change to impact product quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product should be thoroughly assessed and documented. The information and data to demonstrate comparability of the product pre- and post- change can include a combination of testing, validation studies, and non-clinical or clinical studies as necessary to evaluate potential effects of the change. Knowledge and experience accumulated during development and commercial manufacturing regarding how product performance relates to material attributes and process parameters is useful in assessing the impact of manufacturing changes (Ref. 8).\n\nWhen assessing the impact of a change on product quality, some or all of the following considerations should be taken into account by the applicant:\n\nPrior knowledge (e.g., established chemical and biological engineering principles; published, peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature; and applied manufacturing experience) (Ref. 9);\n\nDevelopment and manufacturing of the drug substance and drug product11 (Ref. 10); Footnote 11: For the purposes of this document, \u201cDrug Substance\u201d also refers to \u201cIn vitro Substance.\u201d\n\nProcess validation activities and experience gained during commercial manufacture;\n\nQuality risk management activities;\n\nStudies conducted at less than commercial scale to gain an increased understanding of the effects of the change on product quality and process consistency; and\n\nCumulative impact of multiple related changes.\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application- Certain Biological Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8658308982849121", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Office of Medical Policy, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Bldg. 51, rm. 6337, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information related to the submission of a BLA under section 351(k) of the PHS Act have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0719, and the collections of information in 21 CFR part 601 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0338.\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collection provisions in this guidance, including resulting proposed modifications to the information collections approved under OMB control number 0910-0338, have been submitted to OMB for review as required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and are not for current implementation. Before implementing the information collection provisions contained in this guidance, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing OMB's decision to approve, modify, or disapprove those information collection provisions.\n\n6 Glossary\n\nBiosimilar Product means a biological product submitted in a 351(k) application that has been shown to be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product (see section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act).\n\nCore Name means the component shared among an originator biological product and any related biological product, biosimilar product, or interchangeable product as part of the proper names of those products. Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoeetin alfa.\n\nInterchangeable Product means a biological product that has been shown to meet the standards described in section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act and may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nNonproprietary Name means a name unprotected by trademark rights that is in the public domain. It may be used by the public at large, both lay and professional.\n\nOriginator Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) that is not a related biological product.\n\nProper Name means the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act.18\n\nFootnote 18: Section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(1)(B)(i) and \u00a7 600.3(k)( 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nProprietary Name means the trademark or brand name.\n\nReference Product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nRelated Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) for which there is a previously licensed biological product submitted in a different section 351(a) BLA that contains a drug substance for which certain nomenclature conventions (e.g., United States Adopted Names (USAN) Guiding Principles19) would be expected to provide for use of the same drug substance name.20\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1242538690567017", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nQSE Comparability of\n\nBiotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJune 2005\n\nICH\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI INTRODUCTION (1)........................................................................\n\nA.

This document has been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, November 2004. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan, and the United States.\n\nQSE Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products\n\nSubject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

Therefore, this guidance is intended to assist manufacturers of biotechnological/biological products in the collection of relevant technical information that serves as evidence that the manufacturing process changes will not have an adverse impact on the quality, safety, and efficacy of the drug product. The document does not prescribe any particular analytical, nonclinical, or clinical strategy. The main emphasis of the document is on quality aspects.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nBackground (2)\n\nManufacturers3 of biotechnological/biological products frequently make changes to manufacturing processes4 of products5 both during development and after approval. Reasons for such changes include improving the manufacturing process, increasing scale, improving product stability, and complying with changes in regulatory requirements. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the manufacturer generally evaluates the relevant quality attributes of the product to demonstrate that modifications did not occur that would adversely impact6 the safety and efficacy of the drug product. Such an evaluation should indicate whether or not confirmatory nonclinical or clinical studies are appropriate.\n\nFootnote 3: For convenience, when the term manufacturer is used, it is intended to include any third party having a contractual arrangement to produce the intermediates, drug substance, or drug product on behalf of the marketing authorization holder (or the developer, if prior to market authorization).\n\nFootnote 4: For convenience, when the term manufacturing process(es) is used, it also includes facilities and equipment that might impact on critical processing parameters and, thereby, on product quality.\n\nWhile ICH documents have not specifically addressed considerations for demonstrating comparability between prechange and postchange product, several ICH documents have provided guidance for technical information and data to be submitted in marketing applications that can also be useful for assessing manufacturing process changes (see section IV (4.0) References). This document builds upon the previous ICH guidances and provides additional direction regarding approaches to:\n\nComparing postchange product to prechange product following manufacturing process changes; and\n\nAssessing the impact of observed differences in the quality attributes caused by the manufacturing process change for a given product as it relates to safety and efficacy of the product.\n\nScope (3)\n\nThe principles adopted and explained in this document7 apply to:\n\nFootnote 7: This document applies to situations in which all three of the bulleted conditions are present.\n\nProteins and polypeptides, their derivatives, and products of which they are components, e.g., conjugates. These proteins and polypeptides are produced from recombinant or non-recombinant cell-culture expression systems and can behighly purified and characterized using an appropriate set of analytical procedures;\n\nProducts where manufacturing process changes are made by a single manufacturer, including those made by a contract manufacturer, who can directly compare results from the analysis of prechange and postchange product; and\n\nProducts where manufacturing process changes are made in development or for which a marketing authorization has been granted.\n\nThe principles outlined in this document might also apply to other product types, such as proteins and polypeptides isolated from tissues and body fluids. Manufacturers are advised to consult with the appropriate regional regulatory authority to determine applicability.\n\nGeneral Principles (4)\n\nThe goal of the comparability exercise is to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of drug product produced by a changed manufacturing process through collection and evaluation of the relevant data to determine whether there might be any adverse impact on the drug product due to the manufacturing process changes.\n\nThe demonstration of comparability does not necessarily mean that the quality attributes of the prechange and postchange product are identical, but that they are highly similar and that the existing knowledge is sufficiently predictive to ensure that any differences in quality attributes have no adverse impact upon safety or efficacy of the drug product.\n\nA determination of comparability can be based on a combination of analytical testing, biological assays, and, in some cases, nonclinical and clinical data. If a manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies alone, nonclinical or clinical studies with the postchange product are not warranted. However, where the relationship between specific quality attributes and safety and efficacy has not been established, and differences between quality attributes of the pre- and postchange product are observed, it might be appropriate to include a combination of quality, nonclinical, and/or clinical studies in the comparability exercise.\n\nTo identify the impact of a manufacturing process change, a careful evaluation of all foreseeable consequences for the product should be performed. In consideration of this evaluation, appropriate criteria to define highly similar postchange product can be established. Generally, quality data on the pre- and postchange product are generated, and a comparison is performed that integrates and evaluates all data collected, e.g., routine batch analyses, in-process control, process validation and/or evaluation data, characterization and stability, if appropriate. The comparison of the results to the predefined criteria should allow an objective assessment of whether or not the pre- and postchange product are comparable.\n\nFollowing the evaluation of the quality attributes, the manufacturer could be faced with one of several outcomes, including:\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological:Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.4843049049377441", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 49: See the draft guidance for industry Comparative Analyses and Related Comparative Use Human Factors Studies for a Drug-Device Combination Product Submitted in an ANDA (January 2017). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAs a general matter, in assessing the therapeutic equivalence of a proposed generic drug-device combination product, FDA intends to consider whether the proposed generic product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.50 While FDA does not expect the proposed generic combination product and its RLD to be identical in all respects, any differences identified between a proposed generic combination product and its RLD should be adequately analyzed, scientifically justified, and otherwise not preclude approval under an ANDA. The extent to which differences between the proposed generic combination product and the RLD affect the approximability of the ANDA product will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 314.3. See also the Orange Book, preface to the 41({}^{\\text{a}}) edition, at page vii.\n\nAppendix C Biologic-Led Combination Products\n\nBiologic-led combination products are licensed through one of the two BLA pathways under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), either under a section 351(a) BLA (i.e.,a stand-alone BLA) or under a section 351(k) BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product.51\n\nFootnote 52: Section 351(a)(2)(C) of the PHS Act.\n\n3.2.1 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) Submitted Under Section 351(a)\n\nTo be licensed, a biological product must be shown to be safe, pure, and potent, and the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held must meet standards designed to ensure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.52 A BLA submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act is a stand-alone application in that all of the information and data necessary to demonstrate that these requirements are met are included in the application. This pathway is generally appropriate for biologic-led combination products other than products that are proposed to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a previously licensed biological product.53\n\nFootnote 52: See footnote 17.\n\nFor example, this pathway would be appropriate for the following products when the sponsor is not seeking to rely on FDA's license of another biological product in order to demonstrate biosimilarity to, or interchangeability with, such product:\n\na gene therapy combined with a specialized delivery catheter\n\na vaccine in a pre-filled syringe\n\na protein product in an autoinjector\n\n_BLAs for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Submitted Under Section 351(k)_Section 351(k) of the PHS Act sets forth the requirements for the licensure of biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.54 Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean that the product \"is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences\" between the two products with respect to safety, purity, and potency. To meet the interchangeability standard, an applicant must show that its product \"is biosimilar to the reference product,\" and must further show that the product \"can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient\" and that, for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, \"the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the [two products] is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.\"55 Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nFDA has published guidance indicating the availability of this abbreviated pathway for combination products, as well as considerations related to demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability of such products. With respect to demonstrating biosimilarity, Q.I.4 of the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance) states that some design differences in the delivery device used with the proposed biosimilar product may be permissible, and explains that it may be possible to obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product in a pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, for example, even though the reference product is a biological product licensed in a vial presentation, provided that the proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standard for biosimilarity.\n\nThe Biosimilars Q&A Guidance also explains that licensure under section 351(k) would not be possible if design difference in a delivery device results in any of the following:\n\nA clinically meaningful difference between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nA different route of administration;\n\nA condition of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) for which the reference product has not been previously approved; or\n\nA proposed biosimilar product that otherwise does not meet the standard for biosimilarity.\n\nSee Biosimilars Q&A Guidance for considerations for seeking licensure of a combination product as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product.\n\nAnnex\n\nAnalysis of Pathway Availability for Device-Led Combination Products - Illustrative Examples\n\nTo date, questions regarding pathway availability for combination products have focused most often on device-led combination products. Accordingly, we have included this annex to address common questions utilizing the analyses discussed in section IV.1. The outcomes are also consistent with the expectations discussed in section III, that the application enable evaluation substantially similar to that which would occur if the constituent parts were reviewed under separate applications for the use.\n\nThese hypothetical examples are not intended to reflect a complete analysis of the premarket review considerations that need to be addressed for the types of products discussed in the examples or other types of combination products. In addition, specific products may raise distinct issues that are not taken into account in the examples below. If manufacturers have specific questions relating to their particular products, the Agency recommends that they contact the lead center for the product or OCP, as needed, for assistance.\n\nFor the purposes of the illustrative examples below, it is assumed that the sponsor submitted a 510(k) to CDRH for the combination product.\n\nExample 1: Antimicrobial coating added for the first time to a previously classified device type\n\nPredicate Product:\n\nA previously classified hypothetical class II device (product has no drug or biological product constituent part), which is subject to 510(k) requirements (e.g., an externally-communicating device intended to be implanted in the abdominal cavity for drainage of excessive fluids).\n\nDrug Constituent Part:\n\nA hypothetical antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) that contains the same active ingredient that is in an NDA drug product approved for intravenous administration that has a well-established and understood risk profile as an antimicrobial indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The sponsor has provided FDA documentation of a right of reference to the NDA.56\n\nFootnote 56: Alternatively, the sponsor could rely on FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the NDA approved antimicrobial product, provided all of the requirements of 503(g)(5)(A) and (C) are satisfied and it is scientifically justified. FDA may then consider such findings in its review of a device premarket submission.\n\nNew Product:\n\nThe sponsor proposes to add an antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) to the predicate product described above, making a single-entity combination product (hereinafter referred to as Product A). The purpose of adding the antimicrobial to this device is to prevent infections associated with the surgical procedure and continued use of the product. The sponsor requests the product be considered substantially equivalent to the previously cleared uncoated version of the device. An antimicrobial drug product has never been combined with this devicetype. To make a substantial equivalence determination, the following questions are generally asked:\n\nIs the predicate product legally marketed? Yes.\n\nDoes the predicate product have the same intended use? While both the predicate and the new combination product are intended to drain excessive fluid from the abdominal cavity, the addition of the proposed drug constituent part and the indication of preventing infection are not applicable to the predicate product. These changes raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, precluding a meaningful comparison with the predicate product.57 Therefore, these changes in indications for use of the product and of adding the constituent part would result in a new intended use, and the product would be found not substantially equivalent (NSE). Also, the addition of Antimicrobial A is a different technological characteristic that would raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 57: See 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5) and the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.25533390045166"], "Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a \"statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content.\" What does FDA consider to be a \"sweetener?\" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term \"sweetener\" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.600752115249634", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.3718528747558594", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9627196788787842", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA's Policy on Declaring Small\n\nAmounts of Nutrients and Dietary\n\nIngredients on Nutrition Labels:\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling, HFS-820\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-2371\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA's regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as \"(b)(2)-dietary ingredients.\" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA's regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as \"the compliance requirements.\"\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA's Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2842807173728943", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1707110404968262", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nYou must still declare added sugars in grams and the corresponding percent DV on labels for all dried cranberry products and cranberry beverage products (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In the Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products guidance, we said that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion for these cranberry products to allow the use of a symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV declaration which would lead to a truthful and not misleading statement outside the Nutrition Facts label explaining that sugars are added to improve the palatability of naturally tart cranberries (see Ref. 1). This symbol can be used for cranberry products that are sweetened with added sugars and that contain total sugars per serving at levels no greater than comparable products with no added sugars (i.e. unsweetened grape juice) (Ref. 1).\n\nV.A.1.(a).(iii) Does Allulose Count as an Added Sugar?\n\nThe final rule does not reach a decision as to whether allulose should be excluded from the labeling of carbohydrate, sugars, and/or added sugars. We stated that, as a monosaccharide, itmust be included in the declaration of each, pending any future rulemaking that would otherwise exclude it from the declaration (81 FR 33742 at 33796; 21 CFR 101.9(c)(i) through (iii)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 18, 2019 (84 FR 16272), we announced the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.\" This guidance, when finalized, would advise manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the exclusion of allulose from the amount of \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" declared on the label and the use of a general factor of 0.4 calories per gram for allulose when determining \"Calories\" on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, pending review of the issues in a rulemaking (Ref. 2).\n\nv.a.1.(b) How Do I Calculate Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of November 5, 2018 (83 FR 55266), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals.\" This guidance provides questions and answers (Q&A) on topics related to compliance with the labeling of added sugars. The Q&A discusses how you should determine the amount of added sugars in a serving of a product, as well as which ingredients need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (Ref. 3).\n\nThis guidance also provides a detailed discussion on the calculation of added sugars for ingredients and products such as concentrated fruit and vegetable purees, fruit and vegetable pastes, fruit and vegetable powders, juice cocktails, or juice blends, which often contain juice concentrates (Q&A IV. 7-12), products for which manufacturers employ a hydrolysis step (Q&A IV. 14-16), and products that undergo non-enzymatic browning or fermentation (Q&A IV. 18-21) (Ref. 3). Please refer to this guidance for questions you may have regarding the calculation and declaration of added sugars for a serving of your product.\n\nv.a.2 Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is now considered a nutrient of \"public health significance\" for the general population, and its declaration is now mandatory (81 FR 33742 at 33884). Both the gram amount and the percent DV for Vitamin D must be declared at the bottom of the label, directly preceding the calcium declaration (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)). While only the term \"vitamin D\" can be used on the food labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)), the specific form that is added to a food must be listed in the ingredient list statement (21 CFR 101.4). For Supplement Facts labels, the source ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the word \"as\" or \"from\" (21 CFR 101.36(d)). When you do not identify a source ingredient within the nutrition label, you must list it in an ingredient statement (21 CFR 101.4(g)). You should not list it in both places (81 FR 33742 at 33891).\n\nv.a.3 Potassium\n\nPotassium is also now considered a nutrient of \"public health significance\" for the general population (81 FR 33742 at 33884). It has been assigned an RDI, instead of a DRV (21 CFR 101.9(8)(iv)). We now require the declaration of both the gram amount and the percent DV for potassium at the bottom of the label, directly following the iron declaration. Potassium is now covered under the term \"mineral\" that appears in each section of 21 CFR 101.9. Any listing of potassium on the Nutrition Facts label must meet the specific nutrient declaration requirements for minerals under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4), 101.9(g)(4)(i), 101.9(g)(4)(ii), and 101.9(g)(6). These requirements are discussed further in section VII.E \"Has Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\" below.\n\nHave There Ben Any Changes to the Definition or Presentation of Nutrients That Were Already Required to Be Declared?\n\nv.b.1 Dietary Fiber\n\nAny dietary fiber declared on the label must meet the new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c) and (c)(6)(i)), which is discussed in the following section. This definition includes a listing of dietary fiber that FDA has determined should be in the calculation of dietary fiber for declaration on Nutrition Facts labels. The new definition and process to amend the listing of dietary fiber is discussed in this section.\n\nv.b.1.(a) How Is Dietary Fiber Defined?\n\nDietary fiber is now defined as \"non-digestible soluble and insoluble carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units), and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants; isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) determined by FDA to have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health\" (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)). Soluble fiber and insoluble fiber both must meet this new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A) and (B)).\n\nv.b.1.(a).(i) Which Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrate(s) Qualify as Dietary Fiber?\n\nThe following isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrate(s) should be included in the calculation of the amount of dietary fiber, as FDA has determined that they have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health:\n\nBeta-glucan soluble fiber (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A));\n\nPsyllium husk (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A)(6));\n\nCellulose;\n\nGuar gum;\n\nPectin;\n\nLocust bean gum; and\n\nHydroxypropylmethylcellulose. (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 15, 2018 (83 FR 27894), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Certain Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrates as Dietary Fiber on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels,\" where we stated that we intend to propose that the following eight non-digestible carbohydrates be added to the definition of dietary fiber, as well:\n\nMixed plant cell wall fibers (a broad category that includes fibers like sugar cane fiber and apple fiber, among many others);\n\nArabinoxylan;\n\nAlginate;\n\nInulin and inulin-type fructans;\n\nHigh amylose starch (resistant starch 2);\n\nGalactooligosaccharide;\n\nPolydextrose; and\n\nResistant maltodextrin/dextrin (see Ref. [4]).\n\nUntil we complete rulemaking to add any additional non-digestible carbohydrates to the regulatory definition of dietary fiber, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion to allow manufacturers to include the eight recognized fibers when calculating the amount of dietary fiber to declare on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels.\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9559022188186646"], "Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: iv.2.1 Appearance and Description (4.2.1)\n\nA qualitative statement describing the physical state (e.g., solid, liquid), color, and clarity of the drug product should be provided.\n\niv.2.2 Identity (4.2.2)\n\nThe identity test(s) should be highly specific for the drug product and should be based on unique aspects of its molecular structure and other specific properties. The identity test(s) can be qualitative in nature. While it is recognized that in most cases a single test is adequate, more than one test (physicochemical, biological, and/or immunochemical) may be necessary to establish identity for some products. Some of the methods typically used for characterization of the product, as described in section II.A and in appendix A, may be employed and/or modified as appropriate for the purpose of establishing identity.\n\niv.2.3 Purity and Impurities (4.2.3)\n\nImpurities may be generated or increased during manufacture and/or storage of the drug product. These may be either the same as those occurring in the drug substance itself, process-related, or degradation products which form specifically in the drug product during formulation or during storage. If impurities are qualitatively and quantitatively (i.e., relative amounts and/or concentrations) the same as in the drug substance, testing is not considered necessary. If impurities are known to be introduced or formed during the production and/or storage of the drug product, the levels of these impurities should be determined and acceptance criteria established.\n\nAcceptance criteria and analytical procedures should be developed and justified, based upon previous experience with the drug product, to measure changes in the drug substance during the manufacture and/or storage of the drug product.\n\nThe choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities including degradation products, and from excipients.\n\nPotency (4.2.4)\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section II.A.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological and biological drug substance and/or drug product. When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug substance, an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment of the drug product. However, the rationale for such a choice should be provided.\n\nQuantity (4.2.5)\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance in the drug product, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n\nGeneral Tests (4.2.6)\n\nPhysical description and the measurement of other quality attributes are often important for the evaluation of the drug product functions. Examples of such tests include pH and osmolarity.\n\nAdditional Testing for Unique Dosage Forms (4.2.7)\n\nIt should be recognized that certain unique dosage forms may need additional tests other than those mentioned above.\n\nGLOSSARY (5.0)\n\nAcceptance criteria: Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures which the drug substance or drug product or materials at other stages of manufacture should meet.\n\nAction limit: An internal (in-house) value used to assess the consistency of the process at less critical steps.\n\nBiological activity: The specific ability or capacity of the product to achieve a defined biological effect. Potency is the quantitative measure of the biological activity.\n\nContaminants: Any adventitiously introduced materials (e.g., chemical, biochemical, or microbial species) not intended to be part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance or drug product.\n\nDegradation products: Molecular variants resulting from changes in the desired product or product-related substances brought about over time and/or by the action of, e.g., light, temperature, pH, water, or by reaction with an excipient and/or the immediate container/closure system. Such changes may occur as a result of manufacture and/or storage (e.g., deamidation, oxidation, aggregation, proteolysis). Degradation products may be either product-related substances or product-related impurities.\n\nDesired product: (1) The protein that has the expected structure, or (2) the protein that is expected from the DNA sequence and anticipated post-translational modification (including glycoforms), and from the intended downstream modification to produce an active biological molecule.\n\nDrug product (Dosage form; Finished product): A pharmaceutical product type that contains a drug substance, generally in association with excipients.\n\nDrug substance (Bulk material): The material that is subsequently formulated with excipients to produce the drug product. It can be composed of the desired product, product-related substances, and product- and process-related impurities. It may also contain excipients including other components, such as buffers.\n\nExipient: An ingredient added intentionally to the drug substance which should not have pharmacological properties in the quantity used.\n\nImpurity: Any component present in the drug substance or drug product that is not the desired product, a product-related substance, or an excipient including buffer components. It may be either process- or product-related.\n\nIn-house primary reference material: An appropriately characterized material prepared by the manufacturer from a representative lot(s) for the purpose of biological assay andphysicochemical testing of subsequent lots, and against which in-house working reference material is calibrated.\n\nIn-house working reference material A material prepared similarly to the primary reference material that is established solely to assess and control subsequent lots for the individual attribute in question. It is always calibrated against the in-house primary reference material.\n\nPotency: The measure of the biological activity using a suitably quantitative biological assay (also called potency assay or bioassay), based on the attribute of the product which is linked to the relevant biological properties.\n\nProcess-related impurities: Impurities that are derived from the manufacturing process. They may be derived from cell substrates (e.g., host cell proteins, host cell DNA), cell culture (e.g., inducers, antibiotics, or media components), or downstream processing (e.g., processing reagents or column leachables).\n\nProduct-related impurities: Molecular variants of the desired product (e.g., precursors, certain degradation products arising during manufacture and/or storage) which do not have properties comparable to those of the desired product with respect to activity, efficacy, and safety.\n\nProduct-related substances: Molecular variants of the desired product formed during manufacture and/or storage which are active and have no deleterious effect on the safety and efficacy of the drug product. These variants possess properties comparable to the desired product and are not considered impurities.\n\nReference standards: International or national standards.\n\nSpecification: A list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a drug substance, drug product, or materials at other stages of its manufacture should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. Conformance to specification means that the drug substance and drug product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the acceptance criteria. Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufacturer and approved by regulatory authorities as conditions of approval.\n\nAppendix A Appendix for Physiochemical Characterization (6.1)\n\nThis appendix provides examples of technical approaches that might be considered for structural characterization and confirmation, and evaluation of physicochemical properties of the desired product, drug substance, and/or drug product. The specific technical approach employed will vary from product to product, and alternative approaches, other than those included in this appendix, will be appropriate in many cases. New analytical technology and modifications to existing technology are continuously being developed and should be utilized when appropriate.\n\n1. Structural Characterization and Confirmation (6.1.1)\n\na. Amino acid sequence\n\nThe amino acid sequence of the desired product should be determined to the extent possible using approaches such as those described in items (b) through (e) and then compared with the sequence of the amino acids deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nb. Amino acid composition\n\nThe overall amino acid composition is determined using various hydrolytic and analytical procedures and compared with the amino acid composition deduced from the gene sequence for the desired product, or the natural counterpart, if considered necessary. In many cases, amino acid composition analysis provides some useful structural information for peptides and small proteins, but such data are generally less definitive for large proteins. Quantitative amino acid analysis data can also be used to determine protein content in many cases.\n\nc. Terminal amino acid sequence\n\nTerminal amino acid analysis is performed to identify the nature and homogeneity of the amino- and carboxy-terminal amino acids. If the desired product is found to be heterogeneous with respect to the terminal amino acids, the relative amounts of the variant forms should be determined using an appropriate analytical procedure. The sequence of these terminal amino acids should be compared with the terminal amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nd. Peptide map\n\nElectrophoretic patterns\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6B Specifications- Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological:Biological Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.081932306289673", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.1.1 Appearance and description\n\nA qualitative statement describing the physical state (e.g., solid, liquid) and color of a drug substance should be provided.\n\n4.1.2 Identity\n\nThe identity test(s) should be highly specific for the drug substance and should be based on unique aspects of its molecular structure and/or other specific properties. More than one test (physicochemical, biological and/or immunochemical) may be necessary to establish identity. The identity test(s) can be qualitative in nature. Some of the methods typically used for characterization of the product as described in section 2.1 and in Appendix 6.1 may be employed and/or modified as appropriate for the purpose of establishing identity.\n\n4.1.3 Purity and impurities\n\nThe absolute purity of biotechnological and biological products is difficult to determine and the results are method-dependent (section 2.1.4.). Consequently, the purity of the drug substance is usually estimated by a combination of methods. The choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product from product-related substances and from impurities.\n\nThe impurities observed in these products are classified as process-related and product-related:\n\nProcess-related impurities (section 2.1.4) in the drug substance may include cell culture media, host cell proteins, DNA, monoclonal antibodies or chromatographic media used in purification, solvents and buffer components. These impurities should be minimized by the use of appropriate well-controlled manufacturing processes.\n\nProduct-related impurities (section 2.1.4) in the drug substance are molecular variants with properties different from those of the desired product formed during manufacture and/or storage.\n\nFor the impurities, the choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities. Individual and/or collective acceptance criteria for impurities should be set, as appropriate. Under certain circumstances, acceptance criteria for selected impurities may not be required (section 2.3).\n\n4.1.4 Potency\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section 2.1.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological or biological drug substance and/or drug product. When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug product (section 4.2.4), an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment at the drug substance stage. In some cases, the measurement of specific activity may provide additional useful information.\n\n4.1.5 Quantity\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. The quantity determination may be independent of a reference standard or material. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6B Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.474105954170227", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: In cases where use of a nonspecific assay is justified, other supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting evidence\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nprocedure to control the presence of the opposite enantiomer may be used.\n\nIdentity. A stereospecific identity test is not generally needed in the drug product release specification. When racemization is insignificant during manufacture of the dosage form and on storage, stereospecific identity testing is more appropriately addressed as part of the drug substance specification. When racemization in the dosage form is a concern, chiral assay or enantiomeric impurity testing of the drug product will serve to verify identity.\n\n(e) Water content: This test is important in cases where the new drug substance is known to be hygroscopic or degraded by moisture or when the drug substance is known to be a stoichiometric hydrate. The acceptance criteria may be justified with data on the effects of hydration or moisture absorption. In some cases, a loss on drying procedure may be considered adequate; however, a detection procedure that is specific for water (e.g., Karl Fischer titration) is preferred.\n\n(f) Inorganic impurities: The need for inclusion of tests and acceptance criteria for inorganic impurities (e.g., catalysts) should be studied during development and based on knowledge of the manufacturing process.\n\nProcedures and acceptance criteria for sulfated ash/residue on ignition should follow pharmaceutical precedents; other inorganic impurities may be determined by other appropriate procedures, e.g., atomic absorption spectroscopy.\n\n(g) Microbial limits: There may be a need to specify the total count of aerobic microorganisms, the total count of yeasts and molds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). These should be suitably determined using pharmacopeial procedures. The type of microbial test(s) and acceptance criteria should be based on the nature of the drug substance, method of manufacture, and the intended use of the drug product. For example, sterility testing may be appropriate for drug substances manufactured as sterile, and endotoxin testing may be appropriate for drug substances to formulate an injectable drug product.\n\nDecision Tree #6 provides additional guidance on when microbial limits should be included.\n\n3.3.2 New Drug Products\n\nAdditional tests and acceptance criteria generally should be included for particular new drug products. The following selection presents a representative sample of both the drug products and the types of tests and acceptance criteria that may be appropriate. The specific dosage forms addressed include solid oral drug products, liquid oral drug products, liquid oral drug products, and therapeutics (small and large volume). Application of the concepts in this guidance to other dosage forms is encouraged. Note that issues related to optically active drug substances and to solid state considerations for drug products are discussed in section 3.3.1 of this guidance.\n\nWhere dissolution significantly affects bioavailability, the acceptance criteria should be set to reject batches with unacceptable bioavailability. Otherwise, test conditions and acceptance criteria should be established that pass clinically acceptable batches (see Decision Tree #7(2)).\n\nFor extended-release drug products, in vitro/in vivo correlation may be used to establish acceptance criteria when human bioavailability data are available for formulations exhibiting different release rates. Where such data are not available, and drug release cannot be shown to be independent of in vitro test conditions, then acceptance criteria should be established on the basis of available batch data. Normally, the permitted variability in mean release rate at any given time point should not exceed a total numerical difference of (\\pm 10) percent of the labeled content of drug substance (i.e., a total variability of 20 percent: a requirement of 50(\\pm 10) percent thus means an acceptable range from 40 percent to 60 percent), unless a wider range is supported by a bioequivalence study (see Decision Tree #7(3)).\n\n(b) Disintegration: For rapidly dissolving (dissolution >80 percent in 15 minutes at pH 1.2, 4.0, and 6.8) products containing drugs that are highly soluble throughout the physiological range (dose/solubility volume (\\leq 250) milliliters (mL) from pH 1.2 to 6.8), disintegration may be substituted for dissolution.\n\nDisintegration testing is considered most appropriate when a relationship to dissolution has been established or when disintegration is shown to be more discriminating than dissolution. In such cases dissolution testing may not be necessary. It is expected that development information will be provided to support the robustness of the formulation and manufacturing process with respect to the selection of dissolution versus disintegration testing (see Decision Tree #7(1)).\n\n(c) Hardness/friability: It is normally appropriate to perform hardness and/or friability testing as an in-process control (see section 2.3). Under these circumstances, it is normally not necessary to include these attributes in the specification. If the characteristics of hardness and friability have a critical impact on drug product quality (e.g., chewing tablets), acceptance criteria should be included in the specification.\n\n(d) Uniformity of dosage units: This term includes both the mass of the dosage form and the content of the active substance in the dosage form; a pharmacopeial procedure should be used. In general, the specification should include one or the other, but not both. If appropriate, these tests may be performed in-process; the acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. When weight variation is applied to new drug products exceeding the threshold value to allow testing uniformity by weight variation, applicants should verify during drug development that the homogeneity of the product is adequate.\n\n(e) Water content: A test for water content should be included when appropriate. The acceptance criteria may be justified with data on the effects of hydration or water absorption on the drug product. In some cases, a loss on drying procedure may be considered adequate; however, a detection procedure that is specific for water (e.g., Karl Fischer titration) is preferred.\n\n(f) Microbial limits: Microbial limit testing is seen as an attribute of GMP, as well as of quality assurance. In general, it is advisable to test the drug product unless its components are tested before manufacture and the manufacturing process is known, through validation studies, not to carry a significant risk of microbial contamination or proliferation. It should be noted that, whereas this guidance does not directly address excipients, the principles discussed here may be applicable to excipients as well as to new drug products. Skip testing may be an appropriate approach in both cases, where permissible (see Decision Tree #6 for microbial testing of excipients).\n\nAcceptance criteria should be set for the total count of aerobic microorganisms, the total count of yeasts and molds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas). These should be determined by suitable procedures, using pharmacological procedures, and at a sampling frequency or time point in manufacture that is justified by data and experience. The type of microbial test(s) and acceptance criteria should be based on the nature of the drug substance, method of manufacture, and the intended use of the drug product. With acceptable scientific justification, it should be possible to propose no microbial limit testing for solid oral dosage forms.\n\nDecision Tree #8 provides additional guidance on the use of microbial limits testing.\n\n3.3.2.2 Oral liquids: One or more of the following specific tests will normally be applicable to oral liquids and to powders intended for reconstitution as oral liquids.\n\n(a) Uniformity of dosage units: This term includes both the mass of the dosage form and the content of the active drug substance in the dosage form; a pharmacopeial procedure should be used. In general, the specification should include one or the other, but not both. When weight variation is applied to new drug products exceeding the threshold value to allow testing uniformity by weight variation, applicants should verify during drug development that the homogeneity of the product is adequate.\n\n(d) Antimicrobial pressureout content: For oral liquids needing an antimicrobial pressureout, acceptance criteria for preservative content should be established. Acceptance criteria for preservative content should be used for authentication and preventative necessary content should be used upon the levels of antimicrobial pressureout necessary to maintain microbiological quality of the product at all stages throughout its proposed usage and shelf life. The lowest specified concentration of antimicrobial pressureout should be demonstrated to be effective in controlling microorganisms by using a pharmacopeial antimicrobial pressureout effectiveness test.\n\nTesting for antimicrobial pressureout normally be performed at release. Under certain circumstances, in-process testing may suffice in lieu of release testing.

The guidance discusses some of the considerations for the noninferiority trial to ensure the appropriate demonstration of efficacy when compared to an active-controlled drug.\n\nEffective treatment of some NTDs includes the use of combinations of antimicrobial drugs to enhance efficacy or prevent the development of resistant pathogens. Some development programs may include two or more new investigational drugs. The guidance for industry Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination covers this area.\n\nSome NTDs have known effective treatment, and clinical trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of an investigational drug to the control drug can be used in this situation. The noninferiority clinical trial design poses some unique scientific and regulatory challenges, which focus on an ability to describe a reliable treatment effect of the control drug. Two guidances in this area include the draft guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials25 and the guidance for industry Antibacterial Drug Products: Use of Noninferiority Trials to Support Approval.

Identity\n\nWe recommend that identity assays uniquely identify a product and distinguish it from other products in the same facility. This test is performed on the final labeled product to verify its contents (21 CFR 610.14). Sometimes, a single test is not sufficient to distinguish clearly among products, and therefore, it is good practice to use different types of test methods (e.g., vector genome restriction digest and protein capsid analysis).\n\nIf the final product is ex vivo genetically modified cells, we recommend that identity testing include an assay to measure the presence of vector (i.e., expression assay, restriction digest) or genetic change and an assay specific for the cellular composition of the final product (e.g., cell surface markers).\n\niii. Purity\n\nProduct purity is defined as the relative freedom from extraneous matter in the finished product, whether or not it is harmful to the recipient or deleterious to the product (21 CFR 600.3(r)). Purity testing includes assays for pyrogenicity or endotoxin and residual manufacturing impurities, as outlined under section V.A.3.b., \"Impurities (3.2.S.3.2),\" of this guidance, of the DS, which may include, but are not limited to: proteins; DNA; cell debris; reagents/components used during manufacture, such as cytokines, growth factors, antibodies, and serum; and in the case of ex vivo genetically modified cells, any unintended cellular populations. The assays used to demonstrate product purity should be phase appropriate and may evolve during development as you develop greater understanding of the impurities present in your product, or as you make manufacturing process changes.\n\nAlthough the rabbit pyrogen test method is the current required method for testing certain licensed biological products for pyrogenic substances (21 CFR 610.13(b)), we generally accept alternative test methods, such as the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL).). For any parenteral drug, except those administered intratheally or intraocularly, we recommend that the upper limit of acceptance criterion for endotoxin be 5 Endotoxin Unit (EU)/kg body weight/hour. For intrathecally-administered drugs, we recommend an upper limit of acceptance be set at 0.2 EU/kg bodyweight/hour. For intraocularly-administered drugs, we recommend acceptance criterion of not more than (NMT) 2.0 EU/dose/eye for injected or implanted DPs or NMT 0.5 EU/mL for ophthalmic irrigation products. iv. Potency You should describe and justify in your IND all assays that you will use to measure potency. A potency assay is not required to initiate early phase clinical studies, but we recommend that you have a well-qualified assay to determine dose, as described below and in section V.A.4.c., \"Validation of Analytical Procedures (3.2.S.4.3),\" of this guidance. For additional information on potency assays, please see FDA's Guidance for Industry: \"Potency Tests for Cellular and Gene Therapy Products (Ref. 18). v. Viability You should establish minimum release criteria for viability, where appropriate. For ex vivo genetically modified cells, we recommend a minimum acceptable viability of at least 70 percent. If this level cannot be achieved, we recommend that you submit data in support of a lower viability specification, demonstrating, for example, that dead cells and cell debris do not affect the safe administration of the product and/or the therapeutic effect. vi. Cell Number or Dose Your dose-determining assay is an important part of your DP specifications and should be qualified as suitable for use prior to initiating clinical studies. For additional information on your dose-determining assay, please see section V.A.4.a., \"Specification (3.2.S.4.1),\" of this guidance. If your final product is genetically modified cell-based gene therapy, you should have an acceptance criterion for the minimum number of genetically modified cells in a product lot. We recommend that the product dose for such products be based on the total number of genetically modified cells. c. Validation of Analytical Procedures (3.2.P.5.3) Validation of analytical procedures is usually not required for original IND submissions, but we do recommend that you qualify certain safety-related or dose-related assays, even at an early stage of development (seesection V.A.4.c., \"Validation of Analytical Procedures (3.2.S.4.3),\" of this guidance). If they are the same as those listed for DS testing, you do not need to repeat them but should reference that section of your IND. d. Batch Analyses (3.2.P.5.4) You should provide final product COA(s), if available, or a description of the batches generated to date, and the results of any batch analyses for the DP used in toxicology studies, engineering runs, or clinical studies. Sponsors can also include supportive developmental batches, if appropriate. e. Characterization of Impurities (3.2.P.5.5) You should provide information on characterization of impurities if not previously provided in the \"Impurities (3.2.S.3.2)\" section of the CTD. f. Justification of Specifications (3.2.P.5.6) You should provide justification for the DP specifications. See section V.A.4.e., \"Justification of Specification (3.2.S.4.5),\" of this guidance for additional details.\n6. Reference Standards or Materials (3.2.P.6) You should provide information on the reference standards or reference materials used in testing the DP if not previously provided in the \"Reference Standards or Materials (3.2.S.5)\" section of the CTD.\n7. Container Closure System (3.2.P.7) You should provide a description of the container closure systems, including identity of construction materials for each primary packaging component and its specification. You should also provide information on how the container is sterilized.\n\nPlease see section V.B.5.d., \"Container Closure System (3.2.P.2.4),\" of this guidance for more information and recommendations, regarding the suitability of different final product containers.\n\nIf the final container is an FDA-cleared device, we recommend that you reference the 510(k) number for the device in your submission. For combination products containing a device constituent part, we recommend that you include a table of contents for the combination product (with reference links to other files) in this section, as described in FDA's \"eCTD Technical Conformance Guide: Technical Specifications Document\" (Ref. 4).\n\nStability (3.2.P.8)\n\nStability Summary and Conclusion (3.2.P.8.1) You should summarize the types of studies conducted, protocols used, and the results of the studies. Your summary should include, for example, conclusions regarding storage conditions and shelf life as well as in-use and in-device storage conditions. If a short-term clinical investigation is proposed, or if a DP manufacturing process has limited product hold times, stability data submitted may be correspondingly limited. Early in development, stability data for the gene therapy may not be available to support the entire duration of the proposed clinical investigation. Therefore, we recommend that you submit a prospective plan to collect stability information and update this information to the IND in a timely manner (e.g., in an annual IND update).\n\nPost-Approval Stability Protocol and Stability Commitment (3.2.P.8.2) We do not recommend that you provide a post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment in your IND submission. However, as product development continues, we recommend that you consult with your Quality Reviewer to determine the type of studies that will be necessary to support product expiration dates for commercial manufacturing.\n\nStability Data (3.2.P.8.3) You should provide results of the stability studies in your IND in an appropriate format (e.g., tabular, graphic, narrative). Information on the analytical procedures used to generate the data should also be included, and this may be referenced to other sections of your submission (e.g., \"Analytical Procedures (3.2.P.5.2)\" section of the CTD).\n\nAppendices (3.2.A)\n\nFacilities and Equipment (3.2.A.1) For early phase studies we recommend that facility information should include a diagram illustrating the manufacturing flow of the manufacturing areas, information on all developmental or approved products manipulated in this area, a summary of product contact equipment, and information on procedures and design features of the facility, to prevent contamination or cross-contamination. As noted in section III.D., \"Previously Submitted Information,\" of this guidance\nthis information may be cross-referenced to other regulatory files (e.g. Type V biologics master file).\n\nWe recommend that you include a description of your Quality Unit whose duties should include establishing procedures to qualify reagents and critical materials, prevent microbial contamination, cross-contamination, and product mix-ups. In addition, your Quality Unit should have procedures in place to investigate lot failures, out-of-specification results, and ways to implement corrective actions as product development progresses. We recommend that your IND include a summary of your Quality Unit, including the manner in which quality control testing and oversight are separated from the manufacturing unit.\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Gene Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.1311671733856201", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARMONISATION OF TECHICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE\n\nICH HARMONISED TRIPARTITE GUIDELINE\n\nGood Manufacturing Practice Guide for\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nQ7\n\nCurrent Step 4 version\n\ndated 10 November 2000\n\nThis Guideline has been developed by the appropriate ICH Expert Working Group and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH Process.

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide \"manufacturing\" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term \"should\" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms \"current good manufacturing practices\" and \"good manufacturing practices\" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.927183985710144"], "In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Clinical Policy\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nAugust 2023\n\nGood Clinical Practice\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]\n\nInformed Consent\n\nGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance document was developed by the Office of Clinical Policy (OCIIP), in coordination with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.699632167816162", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA receives frequent inquiries from the academic community (e.g., clinical investigators, IRBs) and the pharmaceutical industry about whether an IND should be submitted for various types of clinical research. Inquiries have related to a range of issues concerning application of the IND requirements in part 312, including, for example:\n\nClinical investigations using marketed drugs\n\nBioequivalence/bioavailability studies\n\nStudies using radiolabeled or cold isotopes\n\nStudies using dietary supplements or foods\n\nStudies using endogenous compounds\n\nPathogenesis studies using modified organisms\n\nStudies using wild-type organisms in challenge models\n\nStudies that do not have a commercial purpose\n\nBecause of the large number of inquiries and wide range of issues, FDA determined that it would be helpful to provide to potential sponsors, clinical investigators, and sponsor-investigators an overview of the IND requirements and related issues.\n\nWith certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which a drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312. Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this guidance elaborate on the criteria for when a study must be conducted under an IND; the types of studies that involve drugs, but that are exempt from the IND requirements; studies involving radioactive drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective (and to which IND requirements therefore do not apply); and FDA's use of enforcement discretion with respect to certain studies using cold isotopes conducted without an IND. Section 6 discusses specific issues that frequently arise concerning application of the IND regulations; section 7 contains frequently asked questions; and section 8 describes the process for seeking advice from FDA concerning the application of the IND regulations to a planned clinical investigation.\n\n3 Research studies that require an IND\n\nIn general, the IND regulations in part 312 require that human research studies be conducted under an IND if all of the following conditions exist:* The research involves a drug as that term is defined in section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).\n* The research is a clinical investigation as defined in the IND regulations (21 CFR 312.3).\n* The clinical investigation is not otherwise exempt from the IND requirements in part 312 (see section IV of this guidance).\n\n1 What Is a Drug?\n\nThe definition of the term drug in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act includes, among other things, \"articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease...\" and \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\" Biological products subject to licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) may also be considered drugs within the meaning of the FD&C Act. A biological product is:\n\n... a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or argphenamine or derivative of argphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.\n\nBiological products include, among other products, bacterial vaccines, allergenic extracts, gene therapy products, growth factors, cytokines, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\nIt is important to note that the drug definition is not limited to compounds intended for a therapeutic purpose.4 The definition also includes compounds intended to affect the structure or function of the body, without regard to whether the compound is intended to influence a disease process. For example, the definition includes compounds administered to healthy individuals to prevent pregnancy or treat male pattern baldness. The definition also includes compounds used for research purposes in healthy subjects to blunt or provoke a physiologic response or study the mechanism of action or metabolism of a drug (see section VI.A). Note, however, that (1) a dietary supplement intended only to affect the structure or function of the body and not intended for a therapeutic purpose is not a drug5 (see section VI.D.1) and (2) a food used as such (i.e., primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value) and not for a therapeutic purpose or to affect the structure or function of the body, other than by providing nutrition, is not a drug (see section VI.D.2).6\n\nWhat Is a Clinical Investigation?\n\nThe IND regulations in SS 312.3(b) define clinical investigation7 as:\n\nFootnote 7: Additional information on clinical investigations is available on FDA\u2019s Web site at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\n... [an] experiment in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, one or more human subjects. For the purposes of [the IND regulations], an experiment is any use of a drug [whether approved or unapproved] except for the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice.\n\nFor example, a randomized trial evaluating an unapproved use of a lawfully marketed drug is a clinical investigation and may require an IND.8 In contrast, use of a lawfully marketed drug for an unapproved use in the course of medical practice is not a clinical investigation and does not require an IND because it involves the use in an individual patient where the primary intent is to treat the patient.\n\nFootnote 8: See section IV.A of this guidance.\n\nIV Clinical Investigations that are Exempt from the IND requirements by Regulation\n\nFDA regulations describe two categories of clinical investigations that are exempt from the IND requirements in part 312, provided the criteria for exemption are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 320.31(b)). The two categories of clinical investigations and the applicable criteria are described in the following subsections. Ordinarily, clinical investigations of drugs that do not meet these criteria must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312.\n\nCertain Research Involving Marketed Drug Products\n\nWhether an IND is needed to conduct a clinical investigation of a marketed drug primarily depends on the intent of the investigation and the degree of risk associated with the use of the drug in the investigation. A clinical investigation of a marketed drug is exempt from the IND requirements if all of the criteria for an exemption in SS 312.2(b) are met:\n\nThe drug product is lawfully marketed in the United States.\n\nThe investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug.\n\nIn the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the drug.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by an IRB (21 CFR part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of SS 312.7 (i.e., the investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).\n\nThe potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator of a planned clinical investigation using a marketed drug is responsible for determining whether the investigation meets the criteria for an exemption.9 If there is uncertainty about whether the exemption criteria are met, the potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator can seek advice from FDA on the applicability of the IND regulations (SS 312.2(e)).\n\nFootnote 9: The preamble to the rule finalizing the IND regulations provides: FDA recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment must be exercised in determining whether the conditions of an investigation \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the risk associated with use of the drug. Because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption. (See the final rule on New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations that published in the Federal Register of March 19, 1987 (52 FR 8798 at 8802)).\n\nThree of the criteria for exemption listed previously merit further discussion.\n\nWhat is meant by a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the United States?\n\nThe preamble to the final rule incorporating the IND exemption criteria into the IND regulations makes clear that the exemption provision was not intended to require use of only the marketed version of the drug product for a clinical investigation to be exempt from the IND requirements. The intent was to provide some latitude to modify the marketed version of the drug product for use in a clinical investigation. In responding to comments asking FDA to clarify to what extent a sponsor could change the marketed drug product or conditions of use and still be exempt from the IND regulations, FDA stated that: The exemption was not intended to require an investigator to use the drug in exactly the same dosage form, dosage levels, and patient populations described in the marketed labeling for the product, but rather to permit changes to the lawfully marketed drug product that do not increase the risks...over the risk presented by use of the product in conformance with its marketed labeling.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final rule, \u201cNew Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations\u201d (52 FR 8798 at 8801, March 19, 1987).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.046482086181641", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nTreatment Use of Investigational Drugs\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/treatment-use-investigational-drugs).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nInvestigational products are sometimes used for treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions either for a single subject or for a group of subjects. The procedures that have evolved for an investigational new drug (IND) used for these purposes reflect the recognition by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that, when no satisfactory alternative treatment exists, subjects are generally willing to accept greater risks from test articles that may treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses. The following mechanisms expand access to promising therapeutic agents without compromising the protection afforded to human subjects or the thoroughness and scientific integrity of product development and marketing approval.\n\nOpen Label Protocol or Open Protocol Ind\n\nThese are usually uncontrolled studies, carried out to obtain additional safety data (Phase 3 studies). They are typically used when the controlled trial has ended and treatment is continued so that the subjects and the controls may continue to receive the benefits of the investigational drug until marketing approval is obtained. These studies require prospective Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and informed consent.\n\nTreatment Ind\n\nThe treatment IND [21 CFR 312-34 and 312-35] is a mechanism for providing eligible subjects with investigational drugs for the treatment of serious and life-threatening illnesses for which there are no satisfactory alternative treatments. A treatment IND may be granted after sufficient data have been collected to show that the drug \"may be effective\" and does not have unreasonable risks. Because data related to safety and side effects are collected, treatment INDs also serve to expand the body of knowledge about the drug.\n\nThere are four requirements that must be met before a treatment IND can be issued: 1) the drug is intended to treat a serious or immediately life-threatening disease; 2) there is no satisfactory alternative treatment available; 3) the drug is already under investigation, ortrials have been completed; and 4) the trial sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval. Treatment IND studies require prospective IRB review and informed consent. A sponsor may apply for a waiver of local IRB review under a treatment IND if it can be shown to be in the best interest of the subjects, and if a satisfactory alternate mechanism for assuring the protection of human subjects is available, e.g., review by a central IRB. Such a waiver does not apply to the informed consent requirement. An IRB may still opt to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. Treatment INDs are discussed under the general heading of expanded access to investigational drugs. On August 13, 2009, FDA issued in the Federal Register 21 CFR Part 312 and 316, Charging for Investigational Drugs Under an Investigational New Drug Application; Expanded Access to Investigational Drugs for Treatment Use; Final Rules. These rules include clinical studies conducted under an IND as well as treatment protocols and treatment INDs. These rules and the accompanying preamble are available at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-19004.pdf (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-19004.pdf).\n\nGroup C Treatment IND\n\nThe \"Group C\" treatment IND was established by agreement between FDA and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The Group C program is a means for the distribution of investigational agents to oncologists for the treatment of cancer under protocols outside the controlled clinical trial. Group C drugs are generally Phase 3 study drugs that have shown evidence of relative and reproducible efficacy in a specific tumor type. They can generally be administered by properly trained physicians without the need for specialized supportive care facilities. Group C drugs are distributed only by the National Institutes of Health under NCI protocols. Although treatment is the primary objective and patients treated under Group C guidelines are not part of a clinical trial, safety and effectiveness data are collected. Because administration of Group C drugs is not done with research intent, FDA has generally granted a waiver from the IRB review requirements [21 CFR 56.105]. Even though FDA has granted a waiver for these drugs, an IRB may still choose to conduct a review under its policies and procedures. The usage of a Group C drug is described in its accompanying \"Guideline Protocol\" document. The Guideline Protocol contains an FDA-approved informed consent document which must be used if there has been no local IRB review.\n\nParallel Track\n\nThe Agency's Parallel Track policy [57 FR 13250] permits wider access to promising new drugs for AIDS/HIV related diseases under a separate \"expanded access\" protocol that \"parallels\" the controlled clinical trials that are essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. It provides an administrative system that expands the availability of drugs for treating AIDS/HIV. These studies require prospective IRB review and informed consent.\n\nEmergence use IND\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n--------------------\nContext title: Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.056520700454712", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nIND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJanuary 2004\n\nClinical Medical\n\nRevision 1\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nAbstract\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if that approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in deciding whether a study of marketed drugs or biological products for treating cancer falls within the exemption under SS 312.2(b)(1) (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) from the general requirement to submit an investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance discusses the Agency's current thinking on when studies of marketed cancer products are exempt from IND regulation based on a risk assessment. The Agency hopes that clarifying its policy will help sponsors identify which studies are exempt, thus saving them from submitting unnecessary IND applications.\n\nThis guidance revises the guidance of the same title published in September 2003. In the September 2003 version, the Agency's final statement was that it believed that most randomized studies of a size that could support a labeling supplement would likely not be exempt from IND regulation under SS 312.2(b)(1)(i), (ii). This is because they would be intended to support approval of a new indication, a significant change in the product labeling, or a significant change in advertising. Experience has shown that this interpretation was formulated too broadly and inappropriately referred to size alone. The Agency has decided to revise this guidance by removing that statement (the last sentence in section V.B). Whether a study could support a change in labeling is a complex determination, based on study design, size, and other factors.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements arecited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nGenerally, regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) require sponsors who wish to study a drug or biological product in humans to submit an IND to the Agency.2 However, these regulations also provide for the exemption of some studies from the requirement to submit an IND if they meet certain criteria. Each year, many INDs for cancer drugs are submitted that contain studies that the Agency determines are exempt. This guidance is intended to help applicants identify which studies may be exempt.\n\nFootnote 2: Part 312 applies to all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or to the licensing provisions of the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)).\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations in SS 312.2(b)(1) provide for the exemption of some studies for some drugs from IND regulations if the studies meet the following five criteria:\n\nThe study is not intended to support FDA approval of a new indication or a significant change in the product labeling.\n\nThe study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent regulations set forth in parts 56 and 50 (21 CFR parts 56 and 50).\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with SS 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs).\n\nRequirements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the specific protocol submitted, and their interpretation is similar for oncologic and nononcologic therapies. Requirement 3 is protocol related and has special meaning in the oncology therapy setting, particularly with respect to doses above the labeled dose, use with other treatments, and use in different populations.\n\nIn the preamble to the IND regulations, which published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1987, the Agency explained that the exemption was not necessarily intended to tie the investigator to the doses and routes of administration and patient population described in the approved labeling, but to permit deviations from the approved labeling to the extent that such changes are supported by the scientific literature and generally known clinical experience. The Agency recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment is exercised in determining whether the planned investigation significantly increases the risk associated with the use of the drug. FDA maintains that \"because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption.\"3\n\nFootnote 3: New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations, Federal Register, March 19, 1987, Vol. 52, Nr. 53, p. 8802.\n\n1996 Agency Cancer Initiative\n\nIn 1996, as part of the President's National Performance Review, the Agency launched its Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs initiative with the goal of accelerating the approval of and expanding patient access to cancer drugs.4 As part of this initiative, the Agency explained that many sponsor-investigators were submitting INDs for exploratory studies for so-called off-label indications for two reasons: (1) IRBs incorrectly believe an IND is required, or (2) the pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to provide a drug free of charge, but mistakenly concludes that the FDA will view this as promotional activity. With the intent of clarifying the Agency's policy and decreasing the number of unnecessary submissions, the Agency emphasized that it would no longer accept INDs considered exempt under SS 312.2(b)(1). (See SS 312.2(b)(4).) Furthermore, FDA stated that providing a drug for study would not, in and of itself, be viewed as a promotional activity if the manufacturer or distributor provides the product for a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation. The Agency explained that it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether an IND is necessary.\n\nFootnote 4: Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs \u2013 Accelerating Approval and Expanding Access (March 1996), CBER, Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturer Assistance, Voice Information System at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, document ID number 0281. Available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genadmin/reincanc.htm\n\nDespite the Agency's attempts to clarify its policy on IND exemptions, many cancer drug IND applications that the Agency determines are exempt from IND regulation are still being submitted unnecessarily. From 1997 to 1999, a majority of investigator IND submissions for marketed cancer drugs were considered exempt (204, 205, and 140 applications in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively).\n\nIII Risk/Benefit analysis in the practice of oncology\n\nAs noted above, a critical question in determining whether a study is exempt involves criterion 3 in the exemption regulations (SS 312.2(b)(1)(iii)): The investigation may not significantly increase the risk associated with use of a drug product. The question of increased risk is determined by assessing the deviation in the planned investigation from the use described in the approved label. In oncology, modifications of labeled dosing recommendations are common and occur as part of oncologists' clinical practice. As outlined below, oncologists are familiar with evaluating the risk of off-label dosing regimens for cancer drug and biological products.\n\nTreatment with cancer drugs may be associated with significant risk from known toxicity. Because effectiveness is often related to dose, a dose close to the maximal tolerated dose is often selected for studies of cancer drugs. This same dose usually becomes the recommended dose in labeling when the new cancer drug is approved with the knowledge that the dose may be altered if it is not tolerated by a patient. Because it is not generally possible to have maximal efficacy in a population without inducing toxicity in some patients, it is not uncommon to observe severe or even lethal side effects from cancer drugs in some patients. In general, these circumstances mean that the toxicity, even potentially lethal toxicity, of cancer drugs is described in approved labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8617061376571655", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: INDs\n\nWho can sponsor an IND? INDs can be sponsored by an individual (e.g., a physician), an institution, or a company.\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs_.\n\nWill drugs for which there is a United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) monograph be exempt from submitting an IND? No. The fact that a drug has a USP monograph does not eliminate the need for an IND, although the drug might be eligible for an expanded access IND if the criteria are met (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs).\n\nWhat is the definition of clinical use in the context of PET drugs?Clinical use refers to administration of the drug to patients as a component of their clinical care with no intent to study the safety or effectiveness of the drug in any systematic way.\nQ20: Can research be conducted under an IND for FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18, or Rubidium Chloride Rb82?\n\nYes. Research and/or investigational studies using these drugs should be conducted under an IND if they are being studied for purposes of commercial clinical use (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs). Human research using a PET drug may be conducted under the RDRC if it is basic science research and not research that is intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes, or research to determine the safety and effectiveness of the radioactive drug or biological product for such purposes (see the guidance The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application).\nQ21: In submitting the physician-sponsored IND, one of the biggest hurdles is trying to get the necessary preclinical pharmacological and toxicology data to support the submission. Would FDA consider reducing the requirement?\n\nIf you have adequate evidence of the PET drug's safe clinical use, you may submit that clinical information to FDA for review and we will determine whether the drug is safe for use within the proposed IND clinical study or studies. The existing clinical information may limit or negate the need for preclinical data. Clinical information from the use of the PET drug's non-radiolabeled ligand may also prove sufficient to limit or negate the need for preclinical data.\n\nFor PET drugs that have not been in clinical use, the extent of necessary preclinical data depends on whether the PET drug ligand is a naturally occurring endogenous substance in humans or not. In general, limited or no preclinical data are necessary to support the use of a PET drug that consists of a ligand that is naturally occurring within humans, if the only major ex vivo modification is the radiolabeling of the ligand. The extent of preclinical data necessary to support a clinical study or studies under an exploratory IND is more limited than the preclinical data necessary for a traditional IND (see the guidance Exploratory IND Studies).\nQ22: Many trials for therapeutic drugs are currently being conducted abroad. If a PET drug is used to determine eligibility for the clinical trial abroad, what would FDA need to know about the PET drug when approval is sought under an NDA for the therapeutic drug?Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe answer to this question depends on several factors. If the use of the PET drug to determine eligibility is an approved indication in the United States, we would need CMC data to show that the PET drug used in the trial is comparable to the drug that is approved for use in the United States. For example, if a PET drug were to be approved in the United States to identify early Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, the foreign trial's PET drug would need to be bioequivalent to the approved drug in the United States.\n\nIf the use of the PET drug to determine eligibility is not an approved indication in the United States (e.g., no PET drugs are currently approved to determine whether a patient has early Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease), the safety and efficacy of the PET drug for that use would have to be established and the data submitted within an NDA.\nQ23: If a PET drug producer creates a centralized IND (e.g., an IND for multicenter participation and protocol compliance, image acquisition standardization, image output harmonization) to use FDG in biomarker trials and that producer has an ANDA, can the applicant cross-reference the CMC data in the ANDA or must the applicant submit the CMC documentation with the IND?\n\nCross-referencing to the approved ANDA is acceptable provided that the drug used in the biomarker trials is the drug produced under the ANDA.\nQ24: What is FDA's current position regarding the continued use of PET drugs (Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection, Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection, and Ammonia N13 Injection) in ongoing clinical trials for new uses of these products or to support clinical trials of therapeutic drugs?\n\nFDA's position is as follows:\n\nIf the PET drug used in the clinical trial is being made at a facility for which manufacturing data have been submitted in an NDA or ANDA for the PET drug, then FDA does not intend to object to use of the PET drug without an IND until December 12, 2015, if this and the other requirements in 21 CFR 312.2 are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b)).\n\nHowever, if significant manufacturing deficiencies are found during the NDA or ANDA review, or during inspection of the facility the PET drug is sourced from, FDA may notify the sponsor that the PET drug should no longer be used in clinical trials.\n\nAfter December 12, 2015, investigational use of a PET drug must be covered by an IND unless it is exempt from all of the IND requirements.\n\nFor a PET drug that has not been approved, what documentation must be provided to support an IND that is already in effect for a therapeutic drug that relies on the PET drug to monitor disease progression or otherwise evaluate the efficacy of the therapeutic drug? Before December 12, 2015, no CMC documentation for the PET drug needs to be submitted to the IND for the therapeutic drug as long as the PET drug is manufactured at a facility for which supportive manufacturing information has been submitted in an NDA or ANDA. After December 12, 2015, for PET drugs manufactured at facilities that are not named in an approved NDA or ANDA, CMC documentation for the PET drug will need to be submitted to the IND for the therapeutic drug.\n\nHow will an investigator know whether an NDA or ANDA has been submitted and what records should be submitted to document that the PET drug was sourced from a facility named in an NDA or ANDA? Documentation should be maintained at the trial site where the investigation is being conducted that indicates the number of the NDA or ANDA that contains the CMC data for the facility from which the drug is sourced. Over the next several months, clinical investigators should make sure this documentation is in place for the PET drugs used in their investigations.\n\nIf an approved PET drug is used to determine eligibility for patient entry into an investigational therapeutic trial, will we have to submit an IND for the PET drug and an IND for the therapeutic drug? No. If the PET drug's use in the investigational trial is not for an approved indication, the sponsor could describe the investigational use of the PET drug in the original IND for the therapeutic drug trial. Two INDs would not be necessary in this situation. The therapeutic drug IND would need to either provide documentation that the PET drug is sourced from a facility with an approved NDA or ANDA, or provide sufficient CMC data to support its use in the trial. 3. ANDAs\n\nDo I need to use the same manufacturing process as the reference listed drug (RLD)? No. Within the context of ANDAs, FDA regulations define a drug that is \"the same as\" a listed drug to mean a generic drug that has the \"identical...active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use\" as its RLD (See 21 CFR314.92(a)(1)). Differences in the manufacturing processes do not affect whether a product may be submitted and approved under an ANDA.\nQ29: Will we need to contact the NDA holder to obtain a sample of the RLD for the comparison testing?\n\nObtaining the RLD for comparison testing is not necessary. FDA recognizes that for PET products, it may not be possible to do a direct comparison with an RLD product because of the short shelf life of these products.\nQ30: A recently approved ANDA for FDG has different inactive ingredients than its RLD, although the drug was found to be bioequivalent. Will this ANDA be considered an RLD?\n\nNo, the ANDA would not be identified as an RLD in the Orange Book.\nQ31: If an ANDA applicant is referencing an NDA, does the applicant have to perform all of the quality control testing listed in that approved NDA? For example, if the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and osmolality testing are listed in the RLD NDA, does the ANDA applicant have to include that testing?\n\nNo. Each application is reviewed on its own merits. The application must establish the necessary quality standards, tests, and specifications, and demonstrate that the quality standards will be met over the life of the product.\nQ32: How would an ANDA applicant be able to demonstrate sameness to the RLD if the composition per batch is not known by the applicant?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3083714246749878", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in sections I and II of this guidance, the purpose of this guidance is to recommend a more efficient and flexible model to evaluate multiple versions of an investigational product that would otherwise be evaluated in separate clinical studies. For a single clinical study of different versions of an investigational product where each version is submitted in a separate IND, it may be challenging to determine how to structure and organize the INDs, and how to submit changes or new information as the study progresses. The framework described here is intended to provide clarity on these topics and, as feasible, to minimize submission of the same information to multiple INDs by facilitating cross-referencing to shared information in the INDs. Sponsors may discuss their specific clinical study and planned submission approach with OTAT, CBER prior to submitting an IND (e.g., by requesting an INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs (INTERACT)3 or pre-IND meeting4).\n\nFootnote 3: For additional information about INTERACT meetings, please see https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/interact-meetings.\n\nFootnote 4: See Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products, Draft Guidance for Industry, December 2017, https://www.fda.gov/media/109951/download. When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nOverview\n\nFor purposes of the framework outlined in this guidance, we refer to INDs either as \"Primary\" or \"Secondary\". The purpose of this nomenclature is to distinguish which INDs will include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Primary INDs) and which INDs will not include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Secondary INDs). For example, an IND amendment that contains only clinical information about the umbrella trial (e.g., no CMC or P/T information) would only need to be submitted to the Primary IND.\n\nFor a clinical study with two different versions of the investigational product (Product A and Product B), we recommend that the sponsor submit two separate INDs, IND A and IND B. One of the INDs, IND A, will be considered the \"Primary\" IND, and should include CMC and P/T information for Product A. IND B will be considered a \"Secondary\" IND, and will include CMC and P/T information for Product B. Primary IND A should also include complete clinical information for the umbrella\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nbetween the product versions may be submitted solely to the Primary IND and incorporated into the Secondary IND(s) by cross-reference.\n* In some cases, sponsors may decide to develop additional versions of a product after an IND has already been submitted. If the sponsor wishes to evaluate the original and additional versions of a product together in an umbrella trial, we recommend that sponsors submit an amendment to the existing IND specifying that it is a Primary IND and follow the steps in the section IV.B of this guidance to submit Secondary IND(s) and add arm(s) to the study.\n\nAppendix B Adding Arms to the Study\n\nIf the arm to be added includes a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy product, (e.g., Product C), we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nIND C with CMC and P/T information for Product C. IND C will be considered a Secondary IND. We recommend that the cover letter for a Secondary IND clearly state that the IND is a Secondary IND and specify the Primary IND number. The Secondary IND should cross-reference the Primary IND for clinical information.\n\nAn amendment to IND A with the updated clinical protocol, which now includes an arm for Product C. We recommend that the cover letter for the amendment to IND A clearly state that the IND is a Primary IND and specify the Secondary IND number(s), including IND C. We recommend that the Primary IND also be updated to include a cross-reference to the Secondary IND for CMC and P/T information related to Product C. It should be noted that the new Secondary IND C cannot go into effect until 30 days after FDA receives the new IND (21 CFR 312.40(b)(1)), unless FDA provides earlier notification that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin (21 CFR 312.40(b)(2)). Administration of Product C cannot begin until IND C goes into effect and IRB approval of the modified protocol has been granted (21 CFR 56.103).\n\nIf the arm to be added does not include a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy (e.g., a new arm that will study Product B in combination with a marketed product, or a new arm that will study investigational Products A and B together), then we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nAn amendment to the Primary IND with the updated clinical protocol (i.e., with the new arm); and\n\nAny additional P/T information supporting the new arm, if applicable, submitted to the relevant IND(s).\n\nSubmitting Other Types of Changes or New Information\n\nFor revisions to the umbrella trial clinical protocol that do not add a new arm or for other types of new clinical information, the sponsor should submit the revised protocol or new clinical information to the Primary IND. The sponsor does not need to submit any information to the Secondary INDs.\n\nFor new CMC or P/T information (e.g., changes to the CMC information, new P/T study report): if the new information is specific to one product (e.g., Product B), then that information should be submitted to IND B only. If the new information is for multiple products (e.g., Products A and B), then the new information should be submitted to INDs A and B (or submitted to IND A and cross-referenced by IND B, as mentioned previously). For new P/T information, the sponsor should also submit an updated investigator brochure to the Primary IND.\n\nClinical Holds and Responses to Hold\n\nIf only one arm (e.g., arm studying Product B) will be placed on hold, then the Primary IND would be placed on partial hold and the relevant Secondary IND would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate).\n\nIn the event that FDA issues an order placing the entire study on clinical hold (e.g., due to a safety issue that applies to all product versions), then all Primary and Secondary INDs would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate). 21 CFR 312.42(a).\n\nTo respond to a clinical hold, the sponsor will need to submit a response to each IND that was placed on hold. However, detailed information responding to each hold comment does not need to be submitted to multiple INDs. For example, if the Primary IND was placed on partial hold due to CMC concerns with a product in a Secondary IND, the sponsor should submit the CMC information responding to the hold comments to the Secondary IND. The response to hold for the Primary IND can refer to the Secondary IND for detailed information.\n\nReporting\n\nIND safety reporting must be performed in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.7 The sponsor must submit safety reports for an investigational product to all of the sponsor's INDs that are relevant to that product. At a minimum, safety reports must be submitted to both the Primary IND and any Secondary IND that contains the CMC and P/T information for that product. In cases where a safety report for one product is relevant to the safety of multiple related products, the safety report must be submitted to all of the relevant INDs (21 CFR 312.32(c)).

May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: II IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have \"... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....\"\n\n14. When IRB members cannot attend a convened meeting, may they send someone from their department to vote for them?No. Alternates who are formally appointed and listed in the membership roster may substitute, but ad hoc substitutes are not permissible as members of an IRB. However, a member who is unable to be present at the convened meeting may participate by video-conference or conference telephone call, when the member has received a copy of the documents that are to be reviewed at the meeting. Such members may vote and be counted as part of the quorum. If allowed by IRB procedures, ad hoc substitutes may attend as consultants and gather information for the absent member, but they may not be counted toward the quorum or participate in either deliberation or voting with the board. The IRB may, of course, ask questions of this representative just as they could of any non-member consultant. Opinions of the absent members that are transmitted by mail, telephone, telefax or e-mail may be considered by the attending IRB members but may not be counted as votes or the quorum for convened meetings.\n\n15 May the IRB use alternate members?\n\nThe use of formally appointed alternate IRB members is acceptable to the FDA, provided that the IRB's written procedures describe the appointment and function of alternate members. The IRB roster should identify the primary member(s) for whom each alternate member may substitute. To ensure maintaining an appropriate quorum, the alternate's qualifications should be comparable to the primary member to be replaced. The IRB minutes should document when an alternate member replaces a primary member. When alternates substitute for a primary member, the alternate member should have received and reviewed the same material that the primary member received or would have received.\n\n16 Does a non-affiliated member need to attend every IRB meeting?\n\nNo. Although 21 CFR 56.108(c) does not specifically require the presence of a member not otherwise affiliated with the institution to constitute a quorum, FDA considers the presence of such members an important element of the IRB's diversity. Therefore, frequent absence of all non-affiliated members is not acceptable to FDA. Acknowledging their important role, many IRBs have appointed more than one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. FDA encourages IRBs to appoint members in accordance with 21 CFR 56.107(a) who will be able to participate fully in the IRB process.\n\n17 Which IRB members should be considered to be scientists and non-scientists?\n\n21 CFR 56.107(c) requires at least one member of the IRB to have primary concerns in the scientific area and at least one to have primary concerns in the non-scientific area. Most IRBs include physicians and Ph.D. level physical or biological scientists. Such members satisfy the requirement for at least one scientist. When an IRB encounters studies involving science beyond the expertise of the members, the IRB may use a consultant to assist in the review, as provided by 21 CFR 56.107(f).\n\nFDA believes the intent of the requirement for diversity of disciplines was to include members who had little or no scientific or medical training or experience. Therefore, nurses, pharmacists and other biomedical health professionals should not be regarded to have \"primary concerns in the non-scientific area.\" In the past, lawyers, clergy and ethicists have been cited as examples of persons whose primary concerns would be in non-scientific areas.\n\nSome members have training in both scientific and non-scientific disciplines, such as a J.D., R.N. While such members are of great value to an IRB, other members who are unambiguously non-scientific should be appointed to satisfy the non-scientist requirement.\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\n18. The FDA regulations [21 CFR 56.104(c)] exempt an emergency use of a test article from prospective IRB review, however, \"... any subsequent use of the test article at the institution is subject to IRB review.\" What does the phrase \"subsequent use\" mean?\n\nFDA regulations allow for one emergency use of a test article in an institution without prospective IRB review, provided that such emergency use is reported to the IRB within five working days after such use. An emergency use is defined as a single use (or single course of treatment, e.g., multiple doses of antibiotic) with one subject. \"Subsequent use\" would be a second use with that subject or the use with another subject.\n\nIn its review of the emergency use, if it is anticipated that the test article may be used again, the IRB should request a protocol and consent document(s) be developed so that an approved protocol would be in place when the next need arises. In spite of the best efforts of the clinical investigator and the IRB, a situation may occur where a second emergency use needs to be considered. FDA believes it is inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to an individual when the only obstacle is lack of time for the IRB to convene, review the use and give approval.\n\n19. Are there any regulations that require clinical investigators to report to the IRB when a study has been completed?\n\nIRBs are required to function under written procedures. One of these procedural requirements [21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)] requires ensuring \"prompt reporting to the IRB of changes in a research activity.\" The completion of the study is a change in activity and should be reported to the IRB. Although subjects will no longer be \"at risk\" under the study, a final report/notice to the IRB allows it to close its files as well as providing information that may be used by the IRB in the evaluation and approval of related studies.\n\n20. What is expedited review?\n\nExpedited review is a procedure through which certain kinds of research may be reviewed and approved without convening a meeting of the IRB. The Agency's IRB regulations [21 CFR 56.110] permit, but do not require, an IRB to review certain categories of research through an exedited procedure if the research involves no more than minimal risk. A list of categories was last published in the Federal Register on January 27, 1981 [46 FR 8980].\n\nThe IRB may also use the expedited review procedure to review minor changes in previously approved research during the period covered by the original approval. Under an expedited review procedure, review of research may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced members of the IRB designated by the chairperson. The reviewer(s) may exercise all the authorities of the IRB, except disapproval. Research may only be disapproved following review by the full committee. The IRB is required to adopt a method of keeping all members advised of research studies that have been approved by expedited review.\n\n[See Conditions for IRB Use of Expedited Review - Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216), Notices (/about-fda/page-not-found)]\n\n21. The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a \"primary reviewer\" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe \"primary reviewer\" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 8.034974098205566", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor's obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency's view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject's decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB's primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor's need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n\"A sponsor's preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval.\" The effect of the IRB's NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor's wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency's policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.241027355194092", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations permit institutions involved in multi-institutional studies to use reasonable methods of joint or cooperative review [21 CFR 56.114 and 45 CFR 46.114, respectively]. While the IRB assumes responsibility for oversight and continuing review, the clinical investigator and the research site retain the responsibility for the conduct of the study.\n\nScope of Cooperative Research Activities\n\nThe regulatory provision for cooperative review arrangements may be applied to different types of cooperative clinical investigations. Examples include research coordinated by cooperative oncology groups and participation by investigators and subjects in a clinical study primarily conducted at or administered by another institution. Often, one institution has the primary responsibility for the conduct of the study and the responsibility for administrative or coordinating functions. At other times, multi center trials may be coordinated by an office or organization that does not actually conduct the clinical study or have an IRB.\n\nWritten Cooperative Review Agreements\n\nThe cooperative research arrangements between institutions may apply to the review of one study, to certain specific categories of studies or to all studies. A single cooperative IRB may provide review for several participating institutions, but the respective responsibilities of the IRB and each institution should be agreed to in writing.\n\nAn institution may agree to delegate the responsibility for initial and continuing review to another institution's IRB. In turn, the IRB agrees to assume responsibility for initial and continuing review. The institution delegating the responsibility for review should understandthat it is agreeing to abide by the reviewing IRB's decisions. The delegating institution remains responsible for ensuring that the research conducted within its own institution is in full accordance with the determinations of the IRB providing the review and oversight.\n\nThe IRB which agrees to review studies conducted at another institution has responsibility for initial and continuing review of the research. Such an IRB, in initially reviewing the study, should take into account the required criteria for approval, the facilities and capabilities of the other institution, and the measures taken by the other institution to ensure compliance with the IRB's determinations. The reviewing IRB needs to be sensitive to factors such as community attitudes.\n\nThe agreement for IRB review of cooperative research should be documented. Depending upon the scope of the agreement, documentation may be simple, in the form of a letter, or more complex such as a formal memorandum of understanding. In the case of studies supported or conducted by HHS, arrangements or agreements may be subject to approval by HHS through the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and should be executed in accordance with OHRP's instructions. Whatever form of documentation is used, copies should be furnished to all parties to the agreement, and to those responsible for ensuring compliance with the regulations and the IRB's determinations. The IRB's records should include documentation of such agreements.\n\nWhen an IRB approves a study, it notifies (in writing) the clinical investigator and the institution at each location for which the IRB has assumed responsibility [21 CFR 56.109(d)]. All required reports from the clinical investigators should be sent directly to the responsible IRB with copies to the investigator's institution, as appropriate.\n\nMulti-institutional IRB\n\nAnother form of cooperative research activity is a multi-institutional IRB, that oversees the research activities of more than one institution in a defined area, such as a city or county. Such an IRB is formed by separate but cooperating institutions and eliminates the need for each facility to organize and staff its own IRB. A variation of this is an IRB that is established by a corporate entity to oversee research at its operating components, for example, a hospital system with facilities at several locations.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheet: \"Non-Local IRB Review\" (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/non-local-irb-review).\n23.8.20.20.5.501 501\n\nrecord submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Cooperative Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.48210573196411133", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator's responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution's IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution's IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be \"men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.\"1 In addition, IRB members must \"be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice\" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution's own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution's own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution's IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution's IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution's IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution's IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution's IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution's IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.606040358543396", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership.

For ease of reference, the numbers assigned to the questions are consecutive throughout this section. These questions and answers are organized as follows.\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nII. IRB Membership\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\nIV. IRB Records\n\nV. Informed Consent Process\n\nVI. Informed Consent Document Content\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nWhat is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)?\n\nUnder FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. In accordance with FDA regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. This group review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects.\n\nThe purpose of IRB review is to assure, both in advance and by periodic review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in the research. To accomplish this purpose, IRBs use a group process to review research protocols and related materials (e.g., informed consent documents and investigator brochures) to ensure protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects of research.\n\n2 Do IRBs have to be formally called by that name?\n\nNo, \"IRB\" is a generic term used by FDA (and HHS) to refer to a group whose function is to review research to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. Each institution may use whatever name it chooses. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the Agency's IRB regulations when studies of FDA regulated products are reviewed and approved.\n\n3 Does an IRB need to register with FDA before approving studies?\n\nAs published in the Federal Register on January 15, 2009, (74 FR 2358), 21 CFR Part 56, Institutional Review Boards, was amended with regard to IRB registration (21 CFR 56.106). This amendment requires each IRB in the United States (U.S.) that reviews FDA-regulated studies to register. IRB registration information is entered into an Internet-based registration system maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (See Guidance for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) Frequently Asked Questions - IRB Registration (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/frequently-asked-questions-irb-registration)).\n\n4 What is an \"assurance\" or a \"multiple project assurance?\"\n\nAn \"assurance,\" is a document negotiated between an institution and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in accordance with HHS regulations. For research involving human subjects conducted by HHS or supported in whole or in part by HHS, the HHS regulations require a written assurance from the performance-site institution that the institution will comply with the HHS protection of human subjects regulations [45 CFR part 46]. The assurance mechanism is described in 45 CFR 46.103. Once an institution's assurance has been approved by HHS, a number is assigned to the assurance. The assurance may be for a single grant or contract (a \"single project assurance\"); for multiple grants (\"multiple project assurances\" - formerly called \"general assurances\"); or for certain types of studies such as oncology group studies and AIDS research group studies (\"cooperative project assurances\"). The Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP) is responsible for implementing the HHS regulations. The address and telephone number for OHRP are: 1101 Wootton Parkway, The Tower Building, Suite 200, Rockville, MD 20852; Toll-Free Telephone within the U.S.: (866) 447-4777, Telephone: (240) 453-6900, FAX: (240) 453-6909.\nCurrently, FDA regulations do not require an assurance. FDA regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56] apply to research involving products regulated by FDA - federal funds and/or support do not need to be involved for the FDA regulations to apply. When research studies involving products regulated by FDA are funded/supported by HHS, the research institution must comply with both the HHS and FDA regulations. [A table of significant differences between 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart A and 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 (/science-research/good-clinical-practice-educational-materials/comparison-fda-and-hhs-human-subject-protection-regulations) is available on the FDA website.]\n\n6 Must an institution establish its own IRB?\n\nNo. Although institutions engaged in research involving human subjects will usually have their own IRBs to oversee research conducted within the institution or by the staff of the institution, FDA regulations permit an institution without an IRB to arrange for an \"outside\" IRB to be responsible for initial and continuing review of studies conducted at the non-IRB institution. Such arrangements should be documented in writing. Individuals conducting research in a non-institutional setting often use established IRBs (independent or institutional) rather than form their own IRBs. Also see the information sheets entitled \"Non-local IRB Review\" and \"Cooperative Research.\"\n\n7 May a hospital IRB review a study that will be conducted outside of the hospital?\n\nYes. IRBs may agree to review research from affiliated or unaffiliated investigators, however, FDA does not require IRBs to assume this responsibility. If the IRB routinely conducts these reviews, the IRB policies should authorize such reviews and the process should be described in the IRB's written procedures. A hospital IRB may review outside studies on an individual basis when the minutes clearly show the members are aware of where the study is to be conducted and when the IRB possesses appropriate knowledge about the study site(s).\n\n8 May IRB members be paid for their services?\n\nThe FDA regulations do not preclude a member from being compensated for services rendered. Payment to IRB members should not be related to or dependent upon a favorable decision. Expenses, such as travel costs, may also be reimbursed.\n\n9 What is the FDA role in IRB liability in malpractice suits?\n\nFDA regulations do not address the question of IRB or institutional liability in the case of malpractice suits. FDA does not have authority to limit liability of IRBs or their members. Compliance with FDA regulations may help minimize an IRB's exposure to liability.\nThe fundamental purpose of IRB review of informed consent is to assure that the rights and welfare of subjects are protected. A signed informed consent document is evidence that the document has been provided to a prospective subject (and presumably, explained) and that the subject has agreed to participate in the research. IRB review of informed consent documents also ensures that the institution has complied with applicable regulations.\n\n11. Does an IRB or institution have to compensate subjects if injury occurs as a result of participation in a research study?\n\nInstitutional policy, not FDA regulation, determines whether compensation and medical treatment(s) will be offered and the conditions that might be placed on subject eligibility for compensation or treatment(s). The FDA informed consent regulation on compensation [21] CFR 50.25(a)(6)] requires that, for research involving more than minimal risk, the subject must be told whether any compensation and any medical treatment(s) are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they are, or where further information may be obtained. Any statement that compensation is not offered must avoid waiving or appearing to waive any of the subject's rights or releasing or appearing to release the investigator, sponsor, or institution from liability for negligence [21] CFR 50.20].\n\nII IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have \"... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....\"\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9836581945419312"], "Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n\nA2: FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is \"mission-critical\" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities \"in advance of or in lieu of\" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA\u2019s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm's previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records \"in advance of or in lieu of\" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested \"in advance of or in lieu of\" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA's use of alternate tools, including a firm's responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.798918724060059", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023, unless superseded by a revised final guidance before that date.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to describe how we will request and conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations at facilities2 where drugs3 are manufactured, processed, packed, or held; facilities covered under FDA's bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) program; and outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 2: In this guidance, the term facility covers persons, sites, and establishments subject to FDA drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring regulations and statutory authority.\n\nFootnote 3: In this guidance, the term drug includes biologics.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nconduct an evaluation. In this guidance, we refer to our use of any combination of these interactive tools as a remote interactive evaluation. FDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation prior to or following other types of regulatory oversight activities (e.g., an inspection or a request for records or other information).7\n\nFootnote 7: A remote interactive evaluation is not the same as an inspection as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or a request for records or other information in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. Similarly, a remote interactive evaluation or a request under section 704(a)(4) does not constitute an inspection for purposes of section 510(h)(3) of the FD&C Act. Section 704(a)(4) does not apply to every inspection program covered by this guidance (e.g., section 704(a)(4) does not apply to the BIMO inspection program). Failure to cooperate with either an inspection or a 704(a)(4) request for records or other information may constitute a limiting of inspection and as a result, FDA may deem the relevant drugs manufactured at these establishments adulterated. See the guidance for industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection (October 2014) for further information.\n\nIII Planning a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nFDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation whenever a program office determines it is appropriate based on mission needs and any travel limitations. FDA conducts inspections for many purposes and programs, and we will consider each of those inspection program areas as possible candidates for a remote interactive evaluation. This policy applies to all drug inspection programs including, but not limited to:\n\nPre-Approval Inspections (PAIs) and Pre-License Inspections (PLIs): FDA may perform a PAI or PLI to assess a marketing application. FDA uses these inspections to ensure that any facility named or referenced in support of an application can perform the proposed manufacturing operations in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to verify conformance with the application, and to confirm that data submitted in the application are accurate and complete.\n\nPost-Approval Inspections (PoAIs): PoAIs focus on a specific drug and changes to its manufacturing operations, the evaluation of process validation, any changes submitted to the application, and the execution of supporting activities according to application commitments and CGMP requirements.\n\nSurveillance Inspections: Surveillance drug quality inspections examine overall operations, including controls that ensure manufacturing processes produce quality drugs, thereby reducing the risk of adulterated or misbranded drugs reaching consumers and patients. FDA uses surveillance inspections to evaluate the CGMP compliance of manufacturing operations. Surveillance inspections are performed at active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing facilities, as well as outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollow-Up and Compliance Inspections: When a specific drug quality problem or facility issue comes to FDA's attention, we may initiate a follow-up or compliance drug quality inspection. For example, FDA may conduct an inspection to investigate: (1) product safety, effectiveness, or quality concerns arising from defect reports; (2) information provided by an informant about a facility; (3) violata facility that were discovered during the inspection of another facility; or (4) corrective actions undertaken by a facility in response to, for example, a warning letter or regulatory meeting.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.7273309230804443", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023.

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions about regulatory and policy issues related to inspections, pending drug applications, and changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.1 This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in August 2020, and revised in January 2021.\n\nFootnote 1: In this guidance, the terms drug and pharmaceutical product include biological products.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nFDA has issued guidance on how to implement manufacturing process and facility changes; relevant guidances that describe the process for reporting changes to an application can be found in section V. References. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) remain fully capable of continuing daily activities, such as application assessments, including facility evaluation and certain inspection activities, while responding to public health needs related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible.\n\nInspections\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to inspections for facilities manufacturing pharmaceutical products and sites involved in the conduct of clinical, analytical, and nonclinical studies.\n\nQ1: How are inspections impacted by COVID-19?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system\" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only \"mission-critical\" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. For the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses.6 This helps ensure the safety of the investigator and the firm's employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish FDA's regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCurrently, certain inspections (e.g., foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical) remain temporarily postponed.\n\nWhile inspections that can be conducted by FDA during the public health emergency are limited due to factors including travel restrictions, FDA intends to continue using alternative tools, when appropriate, to evaluate facilities. This includes requesting existing inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements,7 requesting information from applicants, requesting records and other information directly from facilities and other inspected entities, and conducting remote interactive evaluations8 where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n\nA2: FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9709511995315552", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: COVID-19: Potency Assay Considerations for Monoclonal Antibodies and Other Therapeutic Proteins Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023, unless superseded by a revised final guidance before that date.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nDue to the current public health emergency, FDA is issuing this guidance to assist sponsors in the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other therapeutic proteins1 for use as COVID-19 therapeutics. A critical quality control measure for these products is the development and implementation of a potency assay(s)2 adequate to ensure that each lot is consistently produced with the potency3 necessary to achieve clinical efficacy and that such potency is maintained over the shelf life of the product. Typically, FDA engages with sponsors regarding their development of appropriate potency assays over the course of drug development; theseinteractions usually happen over a span of years. However, given the compressed development timelines associated with therapeutics intended to treat COVID-19, FDA is issuing this guidance to provide more detailed recommendations to drug developers with the goal of facilitating more complete submissions. FDA is committed to supporting all scientifically sound approaches to attenuating the clinical effect of COVID-19 and to doing so in a timely and efficient manner commensurate with the urgent clinical need.\n\nThis guidance applies only to mAbs and other therapeutic proteins4 designed to bind to viral receptors on host cells, inhibit viral entry, and/or elicit Fc-mediated effector function. Vaccines, hyperimmune globulins, gene therapies, cell therapies, and convalescent plasma are not within the scope of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 601.2(a)(3) and (4).\n\nThe guidance describes how potency assay methods required for release and stability testing can be shown to assess comprehensively known or potential mechanism(s) of action of the product. Such methods should also be sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency.5 In addition to release and stability methods, additional methods that demonstrate the biological function(s) of the product may be needed for characterization and comparability studies. The guidance describes methods that applicants should use to ensure the potency of mAbs and other therapeutic proteins proposed for use as anti-infective agents for COVID-19.6\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 601.10 and 21 CFR 211.165(e).\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance only applies to certain products regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Manufacturers of vaccines and medical devices (i.e., in vitro diagnostics) should consult their center review offices regarding appropriate assays and methods for products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)). However, FDA expects that the recommendations set forth in this guidance will continue to apply outside the context of the current public health emergency. Therefore, following the termination of the public health emergency, FDA intends to revise and replace this guidance with an updated guidance that incorporates any appropriate changes based on comments received on this guidance and the Agency's experience with implementation.\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled \"Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019,\" _available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 371(h)(1)(C)) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.7 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.8\n\nFootnote 7: Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability and capability of medical x-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging systems, and image analysis software that are used to diagnose and monitor medical conditions while mitigating circumstances that could lead to patient, healthcare provider, and healthcare technology management (HTM) exposure to COVID-19 for the duration of the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, and renewed for 90 days on April 21, 2020, effective April 26, 2020.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the HHS, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled \"Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019,\" _available at_https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, thisguidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes has been named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19, effective January 27, 2020, and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. The declaration was renewed for another 90 days on April 21, 2020, effective April 26, 2020.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nFDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance will address these urgent public health concerns by helping to increase availability and capability of imaging products needed for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of lung disease in patients with COVID-19. Imaging devices can help visualize pulmonary abnormalities and are used routinely to diagnose and evaluate the causes of reduced lung function. Accordingly, there is increased demand for imaging devices that may assist in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of lung disease. This policy will also help to ensure the availability and capability of imaging products to image patients due to increased demand during this public health emergency. The need to expand the capability to conduct imaging was emphasized by the American College of Radiology (ACR) statement regarding chest radiography: \"Facilities may consider deploying portable radiography units in ambulatory care facilities for use when CXRs [chest radiographs] are considered medically necessary. The surfaces of these machines can be easily cleaned, avoiding the need to bring patients into radiography rooms.\"3\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M.

Additionally, modified use of ultrasound imaging systems may expand the number of healthcare practitioners capable of performing this imaging technique. This policy, which applies to the repurchase, repair, or replacement and reporting requirements for electronic products4 under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions under sections 531-542 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR Chapter I - Subchapter J, among other things, may help hospitals and other healthcare facilities more quickly address the COVID-19 public health emergency and reduce the risk of exposure for healthcare providers and HTM personnel to SARS-CoV-2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Imaging Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7992849349975586", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023, unless superseded by a revised final guidance before that date.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability of devices for remote reviewing and reporting of scanned digital images of pathology slides (\"digital pathology slides\") (hereinafter these devices will be referred to as \"remote digital pathology devices\") during this pandemic.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by HHS, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled \"Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease2019,\" available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 371(h)(1)(C)) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19, and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nFootnote 1: The declaration was renewed on April 21, 2020, effective April 26, 2020. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists. (Jan. 31, 2020), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx).\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nFDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance may help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the availability of remote digital pathology devices during this public health emergency. Increased availability of these devices may help to facilitate continuity of patient care by preventing disruptions to critical pathology services rendered by clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, and by reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThe enforcement policy described in this guidance applies to the following devices (\"digital pathology devices\"), which may be used during the COVID-19 public health emergency, when they are intended for use in remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides:\n\nTable 1\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Although the digital pathology devices listed above are typically used in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, as further discussed in Section IV below, many of these devices possess the capability for reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides from remote locations.\n\nIV Policy\n\nOverview\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency, expanding the availability of remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate pathology services while reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Remote Digital Pathology Devices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Clinical Laboratories, Healthcare Facilities, Pathologists, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.066419839859009"], "With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed?

The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: The calculated mean concentration for each dilution should be within (\\pm)20% of the nominal concentration after correction for dilution and the precision should not exceed 20%.\n\nThe dilution factor(s) applied during study sample analysis should be within the range of dilution factors evaluated during validation.\n\n4.2.7 Stability\n\nStability evaluations should be carried out to ensure that every step taken during sample preparation, processing and analysis as well as the storage conditions used do not affect the concentration of the analyte.\n\nThe storage and analytical conditions applied to the stability tests, such as the sample storage times and temperatures, sample matrix, anticoagulant, and container materials should reflect those used for the study samples. Reference to data published in the literature is not considered sufficient. Validation of storage periods should be performed on QCs that have been stored for a time that is equal to or longer than the study sample storage periods.\n\nStability of the analyte in the studied matrix should be evaluated using low and high concentration QCs. Aliquots of the low and high QCs are analysed at time zero and after the applied storage conditions that are to be evaluated. One bulk QC should be prepared at each concentration level. For each concentration tested, the bulk sample should be divided into a minimum of three aliquots that will be stored, stressed and analysed.\n\nThe QCs are analysed against a calibration curve, obtained from freshly spiked calibration standards in a run with its corresponding freshly spiked QCs or QCs for which stability has been proven. While the use of freshly prepared calibration standards and QCs is the preferred approach, it is recognised that in some cases, for macromolecules, it may be necessary to freeze them overnight. In such cases, valid justification should be provided and freeze-thaw stability demonstrated. QCs should be kept frozen for at least 12 hours between the thawing cycles. The mean concentration at each QC level should be within (\\pm)20% of the nominal concentration.\n\nSince sample dilution may be required for many LBA methods due to a narrow calibration range, the concentrations of the study samples may be consistently higher than the ULOQ of the calibration curve. If this is the case, the concentration of the QCs should be adjusted, considering the applied sample dilution, to represent the actual sample concentration range.\n\nFor fixed dose combination products and specifically labelled drug regimens, the freeze-thaw, bench-top and long-term stability tests of an analyte in matrix should be conducted with the matrix spiked with all of the dosed compounds, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2.8, the investigation of stability should cover bench top (short-term) stability at room temperature or sample preparation temperature and freeze-thaw stability. In addition, long-term stability should be studied.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.6506168842315674", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed?

The guidance is applicable to the bioanalytical methods used to measure concentrations of chemical and biological drug(s) and their metabolite(s) in biological samples (e.g., blood, plasma, serum, other body fluids or tissues) obtained in nonclinical toxicokinetic (TK) studies conducted according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies conducted as surrogates for clinical studies, and all phases of clinical trials, including comparative bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies, in regulatory submissions. Full method validation is recommended for the primary matrix intended to support regulatory submissions. Additional matrices should be validated as necessary.\n\nFor studies that are not submitted for regulatory approval or not considered for regulatory decisions regarding safety, efficacy, or labeling (e.g., exploratory investigations), applicants may decide on the level of qualification that supports their own internal decision-making.\n\nThe information in this guidance applies to the quantitative analysis by ligand binding assays (LBAs) and chromatographic methods such as liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), which are typically used in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) detection.\n\nFor studies that are subject to GLP or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, the bioanalysis of study samples must conform to those requirements. The bioanalysis of biomarkers and bioanalytical methods used for the assessment of immunogenicity are not within the scope of this guidance.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII General Principles (2)\n\nMethod Development (2.1)\n\nThe purpose of bioanalytical method development is to define the design, operating conditions, limitations, and suitability of the method for its intended purpose and to ensure that the method is ready for validation.\n\nBefore or during the development of a bioanalytical method, the applicant is encouraged to, if feasible, understand the analyte of interest (e.g., the physicochemical properties of the drug, in vitro and in vivo metabolism, preferential distribution between red blood cells and plasma, and protein binding) and consider aspects of any prior analytical methods that may be applicable.\n\nMethod development involves identifying the procedures and conditions involved with quantifying the analyte. Method development can include the characterization of the following bioanalytical elements: reference standards, critical reagents, calibration curve, quality control samples (QCs), selectivity and specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, stability of the analyte, and minimum required dilution (MRD).\n\nBioanalytical method development does not require extensive record keeping or notation. Once the method has been developed, bioanalytical method validation proves that the method is suited to the analysis of the study samples.\n\nIf a problem is encountered with the method during the analysis of nonclinical or clinical study samples that requires that the analysis be stopped, any changes to the method and the rationale should be documented.\n\nMethod Validation (2.2)\n\nii.2.1 Full Validation (2.2.1)\n\nBioanalytical method validation is important to ensure the acceptability of assay performance and the reliability of analytical results. A bioanalytical method is defined as a set of procedures used for measuring analyte concentrations in biological samples. A full validation of a bioanalytical method should be performed when establishing a bioanalytical method for the quantification of an analyte in clinical and in applicable nonclinical studies. Full validation should also be performed when implementing an analytical method that is reported in the literature and when a commercial kit is repurposed for bioanalytical use in drug development. Usually, one analyte has to be determined, but on occasion it may be appropriate to measure more than one analyte. This may involve two different drugs, a parent drug with its metabolites or the enantiomers or isomers of a drug. In these cases, the principles of validation and analysis apply to all analytes of interest. For chromatographic methods, a full validation should include the following elements, unless otherwise justified: selectivity, specificity, matrix effect, calibration curve (response function), range (lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to upper limitof quantification (ULOQ)), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution integrity, stability, and reinjection reproducibility.\n\nFor LBAs, the following elements should be evaluated, unless otherwise justified: specificity, selectivity, calibration curve (response function), range (LLOQ to ULOQ), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution linearity, and stability. If necessary, parallelism can be conducted when appropriate study samples are available.\n\nThe assessments that are performed during validation should be relevant to the sample analysis workflow. The matrix used for bioanalytical method validation should be the same as the matrix of the study samples, including anticoagulants and additives. In cases in which it may be difficult to obtain an identical matrix to that of the study samples (e.g., rare matrices such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, bile or in cases where free drug is measured), surrogate matrices may be acceptable for analytical method validation.\n\nThe choice of surrogate matrix should be scientifically justified. Matrix differences within species (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender) are generally not considered different when validating a method.\n\nA specific, detailed, written description of the bioanalytical method and validation procedure should be established a priori. This description may be in the form of a protocol, study plan, report, notebook, or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n\nii.1.2 Partial Validation (2.2.2)\n\nModifications to a fully validated analytical method may be evaluated by partial validation.\n\nPartial validation can range from as little as one accuracy and precision determination to a nearly full validation (refer to section VI.A (6.1)). The items in a partial validation should be determined according to the extent and nature of the changes made to the method.\n\nii.1.3 Cross Validation (2.2.3)\n\nCross validation is required to demonstrate how the reported data are related when multiple bioanalytical methods and/or multiple bioanalytical laboratories are involved (refer to section VI.B (6.2)).\n\nIII Chromatography (3)\n\nReference Standards (3.1)\n\nDuring method validation and the analysis of study samples, a blank biological matrix is spiked with the analyte(s) of interest using solutions of reference standard(s) to prepare calibration standards and QCs. Calibration standards and QCs should be prepared from separate stock solutions. However, calibration standards and QCs may be prepared from the same stock solution provided the accurate preparation and stability of the stock solution should have been verified.\n\nA suitable internal standard (IS) should be added to all calibration standards, QCs, and study samples during sample processing. The absence of an IS should be justified.\n\nIt is important that the reference standard is well characterized and the quality (e.g., purity, identity) of the reference standard and the suitability of the IS is ensured, as the quality will affect the outcome of the analysis and, therefore, the study data. The reference standard used during validation and study sample analysis should be obtained from an authentic and traceable source. The reference standard should be identical to the analyte. If this is not possible, an established form (e.g., salt or hydrate) of known quality should be used.\n\nSuitable reference standards include compendial standards, commercially available standards or sufficiently characterized standards prepared in-house or by an external organization. A certificate of analysis (CoA) or an equivalent alternative is recommended to ensure quality and to provide information on the purity, storage conditions, retest/expiration date and batch number of the reference standard.\n\nA CoA is not required for the IS as long as the suitability for use is demonstrated, e.g., a lack of analytical interference is shown for the substance itself or any impurities thereof.\n\nWhen MS detection is used, the use of the stable isotope-labeled analyte as the IS is recommended whenever possible. However, it is important that the labeled standard is of high isotope purity and that no isotope exchange reaction occurs. The presence of unlabeled analyte should be checked and if unlabeled analyte is detected, the potential influence should be evaluated during method validation.\n\nStock and working solutions should only be prepared from reference standards that are within the stability period as documented in the CoA (either expiration date or the retest date).\n\nValidation (3.2)\n\nSelectivity (3.2.1)\n\nSelectivity is the ability of an analytical method to differentiate and measure the analyte in the presence of potential interfering substances in the blank biological matrix.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10 Bioanalytical Method Validation and Study Sample Analysis\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8224945068359375", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency's reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase \"mixtures of articles and carriers\" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing \"cold\" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological's thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered \"raw data\" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes \"studies in progress on June 20, 1979\" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.828014850616455", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: Minimum Required Dilution\n\nMRD is a dilution factor employed in samples that are diluted with buffer solution to reduce the background signal or matrix interference on the analysis using LBA. The MRD should be identical for all samples including calibration standards and the QCs and it should be determined during method development. If MRD is changed after establishment of the method, partial validation is necessary. MRD should be defined in the Validation Report of the analytical method.\n\nCommercial and Diagnostic Kits\n\nCommercial or diagnostic kits (referred to as kits) are sometimes co-developed with new chemical or biological drugs for point-of-care patient diagnosis. The recommendations in this section of the guideline do not apply to the development of kits that are intended for point-of-care patient diagnosis (e.g., companion or complimentary diagnostic kits). Refer to the appropriate guideline documents regarding regulatory expectations for the development of these kits.\n\nIf an applicant repurposes a kit (instead of developing a new method) or utilises \"research use only\" kits to measure chemical or biological drug concentrations during the development of a novel drug, the applicant should assess the kit validation to ensure that it conforms to the drug development standards described in this guideline.\n\nValidation considerations for kit assays include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIf the reference standard in the kit differs from that of the study samples, testing should evaluate differences in assay performance of the kit reagents. The specificity, accuracy, precision and stability of the kit assay should be demonstrated under actual conditions ofuse in the facility conducting the sample analysis. Modifications from kit processing instructions should be completely validated.\n\nKits that use sparse calibration standards (e.g., one- or two-point calibration curves) should include in-house validation experiments to establish the calibration curve with a sufficient number of standards across the calibration range.\n\nActual QC concentrations should be known. Concentrations of QCs expressed as ranges are not sufficient for quantitative applications. In such cases QCs with known concentrations should be prepared and used, independent of the kit-supplied QCs.\n\nCalibration standards and QCs should be prepared in the same matrix as the study samples. Kits with calibration standards and QCs prepared in a matrix different from the study samples should be justified and appropriate experiments should be performed.\n\nIf multiple kit assay lots are used within a study, lot-to-lot variability and comparability should be addressed for any critical reagents included in the kits.\n\nIf a kit using multiple assay plates is employed, sufficient replicate QCs should be used on each plate to monitor the accuracy of the assay. Acceptance criteria should be established for the individual plates and for the overall analytical run.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.9783294200897217", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: When the tonicity of a product is declared in its labeling, the manufacturing process should be appropriately controlled to assure that the osmolality of every batch will conform to labeled osmolality. Osmolality determined during development and validation might be sufficient to justify not performing testing of every batch. This data should be submitted in the application.\nQ60: When is it necessary to dilute final product to meet the concentration specification? Is there a preference to use sterile water, normal saline, or half normal saline?\n\nNormal saline is the most commonly used agent to maintain the isotonicity of the final drug product. However, you may use any of the three named diluents. Justification should be provided if an isotonic product cannot be formulated. In addition, for ANDA products, the diluent used should be the same as the diluent used in the RLD for which the ANDA is being submitted.\nQ61: What are FDA's expectations on handling invalid tests and sample size for repeat testing?\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 212, it is acceptable to repeat a test that failed the first time if a mistake or error was made in the first attempt to test (i.e., the test was truly invalid). It is not acceptable to simply retest with a new sample because of a failing result; true out-of-specification results must be investigated to determine the cause of the failure to meet the specifications, and corrections must be implemented as appropriate. If a repeat test is appropriate, the sample size depends on what parameter is being tested and should be chosen to ensure the test results are representative of the characteristics of the batch.\nQ62: Does FDA have current information about drug master files (DMFs) that might apply to PET?\n\nPET producers should contact their suppliers to determine whether they have a DMF on file with the FDA. FDA does not provide a list of DMFs that are available for reference. For further information about DMFs, see FDA Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) on DMF files, available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ManualofPoliciesProcedures/ucm079564.pdf. You can also direct any specific DMF questions to\n\ndmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.\n\nApplicants that plan to rely on one or more DMFs should provide a letter of authorization from the DMF holder that gives the ANDA or NDA applicant the right to reference the DMF and for FDA to refer to the DMF in its review of the application in the ANDA or NDA.\nQ63: Is notification to the FDA required for replacement of quality control equipment (e.g., gas chromatography (GC), HPLC, or dose calibrator)Replacement of quality control equipment is managed under the facility's quality system and should be qualified for installation, operation, and performance; therefore, notification is not necessary. However, any change in the analytical method should be reported in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in precursor require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70(b).\n* Does a change in container closure system require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in the vendor of inactive ingredients or other auxiliary materials require submission of a supplement? No, these are reported in the annual report.\n\nv.2.2 Stability Testing\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs (the PET drug applications guidance) states that quality control needs to be done for three qualification batches at the highest concentration allowed. Upon how many batches are we required to perform stability testing?_** You should conduct stability testing of three batches. For more information, see Attachment I of the PET drug applications guidance titled \"Sample Formats\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Section.\"5 Footnote 5: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM078740.pdf.\n\nDoes stability testing need to be performed on each vial size, for example, 30 mL and 50 mL, if the components are identical? We recommend that you choose the highest vial size (i.e., the 50 mL size in the example). In some cases, multiple presentations might need to be tested (e.g., if the headspace oxygen-to-surface ratio differs significantly).\n\nAre we required to perform forced degradation studies with these short shelf life drugs?For the commonly used PET drugs (e.g., FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18), where the storage and other molecular stability characteristics under different conditions have been well defined in the scientific literature, forced degradation studies are not needed when an NDA or ANDA is submitted.\n\nFor new PET drugs, the molecular stability and storage conditions under certain stress conditions (e.g., photo-stability, pH dependant stability) might need to be evaluated and described in the application. The need for this testing should be discussed with the review division during product development (e.g., at the End of Phase-2 meeting). During inspection, the inspector may inspect the source data.\nQ70: Assuming that product stability is demonstrated, is there any limit to expiry of the product?\n\nThe stability data should support the proposed expiration dating period. These data are submitted in the application for which the expiration dating period is approved. The individual batch used may expire earlier than the approved expiration dating period. It is expected that the product will be used before its specified expiry.\n\nv.2.3 Sterility Testing\n\nQ71: With respect to sterility testing, what are the requirements for the sample hold time validation and expected storage conditions during hold time?\n\nSterility testing can begin 30 hours after manufacture without further justification.\n\nDelays beyond this time need to be justified and shown to be valid (i.e., that contamination, if present, would result in growth). Samples are to be stored appropriately during the extended hold time; the hot cell might be appropriate for storage.\nQ72: Would the air quality requirement still hold if the sterility inoculations were performed in Hungate tubes, which is generally performed within the hot cell environment, not a laminar flow environment?\n\nWe recommend that sterility tests be performed in a Class 100 environment so there is no risk of environmental contamination. However, we do understand if the sterility testing has to be performed in a hot cell because of the nature of the product.\n\nC. Current Good Manufacturing Practices\n\nQ73: Are there specific guidances for the qualification of vendors that would guide us in selecting components and establishing standards for vendor compliance?No guidance on this topic is presently available.\n\nQ74: FDA recently issued the guidance PET Drugs - Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) (Small Entity Compliance Guide) that appears to be identical to the guidance issued in December 2009. Is there a definition of small entity? Does the August 2011 version differ from the version dated December 2009?_\n\nThere are no substantive differences between the Small Entity Compliance Guide and the guidance published in December 2009. The Small Entity Compliance Guide on Drug CGMPs was prepared to comply with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). The Act states the following:\n\nFor each rule or group of related rules for which an agency is required to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis under section 605(b) of title 5, United States Code, the agency shall publish 1 or more guides to assist small entities in complying with the rule and shall entitle such publications \"small entity compliance guides.\"\n\nA definition for small entity can be found in section 211 of the Act.\nQ75: Is identity testing on mannose triflate required? If required, does it need to be a specific identity test?\n\nAlthough an identity test on incoming components is required to be performed, a specific identity test is not needed under certain conditions (see 21 CFR 212.40(c). When the finished-product testing of a PET drug product includes testing to ensure that the correct components have been used, the PET drug producer need only determine that each lot of incoming components complies with written specifications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier (21 CFR 212.40(c)(1)(i)). We believe that the use of this type of finished-product testing makes specific identity testing of components redundant and unnecessary. For example, when identity of the F18 radionuclide is established as part of the finished-product testing and the method of production used is well-documented and understood, it can be reasonably argued that the component that yields this radionuclide is likely to be O 18 water. In this case, a specific identity test for O 18 water is not necessary before the lot is used in production. Similarly, a specific identity test before using a lot of mannose triflate might be redundant and unnecessary when (1) a well-understood method of synthesis of FDG is used, (2) a test to confirm the radiochemical identity is performed in the finished drug product, and (3) the mannose triflate was obtained from a reliable supplier with whom a relationship has been previously established and is accompanied by a certificate of analysis.\n\nWhat is FDA's current thinking on conditional final release testing if there was a problem or malfunction? Under the CGMP regulations at 21 CFR 212.70, you may not release another batch of the PET product until you have corrected the problem concerning the malfunction of analytical equipment. A reserve sample is needed to complete the finished product testing.\n\n*Which analytical techniques, if any, require validation?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.106960296630859", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: [5.16] They need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\n[5.17] They include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n\nAfter these considerations, if the evaluation would result in only a small number of chemical transformation steps, then it is generally appropriate to include one or more additional chemical transformation steps in Section 3.2.S.2.2. This is to ensure that enough steps are conducted under GMPto appropriately mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material. The following paragraphs provide further clarification on this risk mitigation and should be considered together.\n\nAlthough ICH Q11 does not specify how many steps should be performed under GMP, ICH Q11 recommends the inclusion of \"multiple chemical transformation steps\" in Section 3.2.S.2.2 in order to reduce the risk of contamination and support the effective implementation of the control strategy throughout the product lifecycle. When there would be a small number of steps, there is an increased risk of contamination that needs to be addressed by the applicant in their starting material justification, and will often be best mitigated by including one or more additional steps in Section 3.2.S.2.2.\n\nPotential risks from future changes to the starting material synthesis should also be considered (see Q&A 5.16). There is an increased risk that impurities generated as a result of a change to the manufacturing process upstream of the starting material may not be detected or purged appropriately if the starting material is only a small number of steps from the drug substance. In order to determine how many additional steps to include, the applicant may also consider other approaches to risk mitigation; for example, inclusion of analytical methodologies in the specification of the proposed starting material that are designed to detect a wide range of possible impurities based on different physical and chemical separation and detection principles. Appropriate acceptance criteria for unspecified impurities should be included in the specification.\n\nThe applicant should include in their justification of the proposed starting material a comprehensive description as to what factors were considered in deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is provided in Section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application to ensure that risks are appropriately mitigated.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.238945484161377"], "Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter IV.

For example, if the directions on your label say to take 1-3 tablets with breakfast, the serving size would be 3 tablets.\n\n21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2 in the Miscellaneous Category\n\n5 May I use flexibility in the wording for \"Serving Size?\"\n\nNo. You must use the term \"Serving Size.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)\n\nNutrient Declaration\n\nWhat nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nTotal calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron must be listed when they are present in measurable amounts. A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as \"zero\" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for \"% Daily Value\" that refers to the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, not in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel. Ingredients in dietary supplements that are not dietary ingredients, such as binders, excipients, fillers, must be included in the ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nMust I declare vitamin E when it occurs naturally in my product and I make no claim for it?\n\nNo. Because Vitamin E is not one of the 14 mandatory dietary ingredients, it does not need to be declared when it occurs naturally.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMay I declare protein on the label if my product contains only individual amino acids?\n\nNo. You may not declare protein on your products that contain only amino acids.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMust I list the dietary ingredients in my products in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list \"folic acid\" or \"folacin\" without parentheses in place of \"folate.\" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (\"the final rule\"). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" and \"I\" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of \"infants\" (or \"infants 7 to 12 months\") and \"children less than 4 years\" have been changed to \"infants through 12 months\" and \"children 1 through 3 years of age\" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines \"food\" as: \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of \"drug\") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of \"food,\" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.354843258857727", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and \"other carbohydrate\" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the \"Nutrition Facts\" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \"Nutrition Facts\" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for \"Calories,\" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for \"Calories\" and the numeric value of \"Calories.\" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" declaration now immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" is the declaration of \"Serving size.\" \"Serving size\" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the \"Serving size\" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the \"Serving size\" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry\" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics\" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile \"Calories from fat\" can no longer be declared, \"Calories from saturated fat\" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare \"Added Sugars\" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for \"Total Sugars\" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The 'X' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that \"added sugars\" are a subcomponent of \"total sugars.\" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement \"Contains less than 1 gram\" or, alternatively, \"less than 1 gram\" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.1745941638946533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure/Function Claims\n\nJANUARY 2002\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA's good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency's current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called \"health claims.\"\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn't a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is \"protective against the development of cancer\" or \"reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis\" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are \"relieves crushing chest pain (angina),\" \"improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),\" or \"relief of bronchospasm (asthma).\"\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don't use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman's terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.9694859981536865", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement \"Not a significant source of ____\" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when \"circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply\" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, \"FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.\"\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the \"Not a significant source of ____\" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as \"Not a significant source of other nutrients\" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA's labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be \"packaged and sold individually,\" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement \"This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale\" or \"This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale\" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The \"principal display panel\" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The \"information panel\" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), \"Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber\"). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.344192028045654"], "From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Questions and Answers\n\nTHE GLP REGULATIONS - GENERAL\n\nDo the GLPs require the establishment of Technical Operation Manuals?\n\nNo.\n\nIf a laboratory is accredited by AAALAC (American Association for Accreditation of\n\nLaboratory Animal Care), does this serve as assurance of meeting the GLP\n\nrequirements for animal care and facilities?\n\nAAALAC accreditation does not substitute for Agency inspection nor does it guarantee\n\nautomatic compliance with the applicable GLP sections. It is of value, however, in that\n\nit demonstrates that the facility has favorably passed a peer group review.\n\nResults of the quality assurance unit inspections are not routinely available to an\n\nAgency investigator. However, the conforming amendments require that GLP\n\ndeviations are to be reported in detail with each submission to the FDA. Are we\n\nrequired to send the contents of the quality assurance unit inspection report to the\n\nFDA?\n\nNo. The GLP compliance statement in the conforming amendments to the GLPs was\n\nincluded for several reasons:\n\n(a) to provide an orderly transition across the effective date of the regulations. It was\n\nunderstood that applications for research and marketing permits submitted to the\n\nAgency for some period of time after the GLP effective date of June 20, 1979, would\n\ncontain final reports of nonclinical studies begun and completed prior to the effective date, begun prior to the effective date and completed thereafter, and begun and completed after the effective date. Studies begun and completed prior to the effective date are not required to comply with the GLPs and accordingly, the conforming amendments require that differences be noted. Similar considerations apply to studies begun prior to and completed after the effective date, although in these studies, those portions underway as of the effective date are required to comply.\n\n(b) to provide for the submission of final reports of studies, which were not required to comply with the GLPs but which otherwise, contribute to safety evaluation. The GLPs do not apply to safety studies conducted by independent investigators studying regulated products. Such studies are not sponsored by the product manufacturer, nor is there any intention to submit the results to the Agency. The study results are published in the open literature. The sponsor is required red to submit the study to the Agency but could in no way control the research. If the sponsor wishes to use the data in support of the application, the conforming amendments provide a mechanism by which the sponsor can prove that the study was not compromised. A similar situation exists for preliminary exploratory safety studies done by the sponsor.\n\n(c) to foster GLP compliance attitudes by management. The conforming amendment causes management to act responsively to all cases of GLP non-compliance and to take prompt corrective actions.\n\nWith these purposes in mind, the conforming amendments require a brief statement of overall GLP compliance and need not contain the Quality Assurance Unit findings. The Quality Assurance Unit findings should cover short-term GLP deviations, which are promptly corrected. The conforming amendments statement should cover those systematic GLP deviations which have occurred throughout the study.\n\nWho provides the GLP compliance statement required by the conforming amendments?\n\nThis statement is provided by the applicant for the research or marketing permit.\n\nWhat is the degree of compliance with GLPs, which the FDA will require for INDs submitted after June 20, 1979, but which include toxicology studies initiated before June 20, 1979, and completed after June 20, 1979?\n\nThose portions of the studies underway as of the effective date will have to be done in accord with the applicable provisions of the GLPs.\n\nDo nonclinical laboratory studies completed *prior to June 20, 1979 but submitted as part of an IND or NDA subsequent to that date fall under the conforming amendments?\n\nThese studies would not have to have been conducted under the GLPs but the conforming amendment statement of compliance is required.\n\nHow many members of the National Association of Life Science Industries (NALSI) come under the GLPs? How can the membership list be obtained?The Agency has not compiled such a list. A membership list is available from NALSI, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 2oOo6. All members who conduct nonclinical laboratory studies are subject to the GLPs.\n\nShould a contract laboratory ask a sponsor if the article they are testing is subject to FDA regulations? Should these studies then be listed as a separate master list of studies to comply with the GLP regulations? Contract laboratories should ask sponsors to identify studies which are associated with FDA regulated products, although the GLPs place this responsibility on the sponsor. A separate listing of such studies, apart from the firm's master list of all studies undertaken by the firm will satisfy the requirements of the GLPs.\n\nWhat impact have the GLP regulations had on the cost of performing toxicology studies? The president of a large contracting laboratory has stated that three years ago a chronic rat study could be done for about $8o,0oo; and that the current cost is closer $250,000. He estimated that half of the increased cost is due to GLPs, 30% to larger numbers of test animals per study on present day protocols and 20% to inflation. The Agency has not developed cost estimates.\n\n58.1 Scope\n\n58.3 Definitionsapplicability to Studies Performed Under Grants and Contracts\n\n58.15 Inspection of a Testing Facility\n\nAre short-term microbiological screening tests and microbiological preservative stability research and development covered by the GLPs? Microbiological preservative stability research, development and quality control tests are not covered by the GLPs. However, microbiological tests conducted to establish the toxicological profile of an article are covered.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit analytical data collected on a test article? Yes, insofar as it contributes to the evaluation of a nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit draft final protocols and draft final reports? The regulations do not require that such materials be retained, however, if draft reports are available, they may be audited in order to help the Agency follow the process from raw data to final report.\n\nExplain why the GLPs apply to \"microorganisms or subparts thereof.\" How are microorganisms currently used by FDA in assessment of safety? For certain products, FDA does request that microbial tests be done for the purpose of obtaining information on potential neoplastic and mutagenic activity. Likewise, microsomal preparations (subparts thereof) are used as activating systems for certain in vitro tests. When this happens, the tests should be done in accord with the GLPs.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to engineering/electronic testing laboratories that perform functionality tests on medical devices? No.\n\nIs a licensed manufacturer of human biological products subject to continuing GLP inspection? The GLPs apply to safety studies submitted to the Agency in order to obtain the license. They do not apply to such studies conducted for the purpose of obtaining batch release of licensed biologicals.\n\nWill nonclinical studies in support of medical devices which do not come in contact with man (e.g., stopcocks, a gas machine, a urine bag) be subject to the GLP regulations? If the medical device application for a research or marketing permit does not require the submission of safety data for approval, then the GLPs do not apply.\n\nIf a test article is produced by microbial fermentation, are tests run on the bacteria, such as pathogenicity or virulence covered by the GLPs? No.\n\nAre studies performed for label purposes as required by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act considered to be nonclinical laboratory studies under the GLPs? No.\n\nWhen an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving \"diagnostic products\" and \"medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man\" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7553024291992188", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.10.2 Studies During Clinical Development\n\nAdditional studies may be warranted to clarify observed or suspected adverse effects in animals and humans during clinical development.\n\n2.10.3 Studies Before Approval\n\nSafety pharmacology effects on systems listed in section 2.8 should be assessed prior to product approval, unless not warranted, in which case this should be justified. Available information from toxicology studies adequately designed and conducted to address safety pharmacology endpoints, or information from clinical studies, can support this assessment and replace safety pharmacology studies.\n\nApplication of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)\n\nIt is important to ensure the quality and reliability of non-clinical safety studies. This is normally accomplished through the conduct of the studies in compliance with GLP. Due to the unique design of, and practical considerations for, some safety pharmacology studies, it may not be feasible to conduct these in compliance with GLP. It has to be emphasized that data quality and integrity in safety pharmacology studies should be ensured even in the absence of formal adherence to the principles of GLP. When studies are not conducted in compliance with GLP, study reconstruction should be ensured through adequate documentation of study conduct and archiving of data. Any study or study component not conducted in compliance with GLP should be adequately justified, and the potential impact on evaluation of the safety pharmacology endpoints should be explained.\n\nThe safety pharmacology core battery should ordinarily be conducted in compliance with GLP. Follow-up and supplemental studies should be conducted in compliance with GLP to the greatest extent feasible. Safety pharmacology investigations can be part of toxicology studies; in such cases, these studies would be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nPrimary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nGenerally, secondary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP. Results from secondary pharmacodynamic studies conducted during the compound selection process may contribute to the safety pharmacology evaluation; when there is no cause for concern (e.g., there are no findings for the safety pharmacological endpoint or the chemical or therapeutic class), these studies need not be repeated in compliance with GLP. In some circumstances, results of secondary pharmacodynamic studies may make a pivotal contribution to the safety evaluation for potential adverse effects in humans, and these are normally conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\n3 Notes\n--------------------\nContext title: S7A_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.3542592525482178", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.2.1 ERT Products Used in Nonclinical Studies\n\nThe investigational ERT product that will be administered in clinical trials should be used in the nonclinical studies that are used to determine a safe dose in humans. Sponsors should characterize each lot of an investigational ERT product used in the nonclinical studies according to prospectively established criteria, consistent with the stage of product development. Sponsors should also highlight and discuss in the investigational new drug application (IND) similarities and differences between the drug substance and the drug product intended for use in nonclinical studies and for clinical trials, including differences in excipients.\n\nii.2.2 Selecting Animal Species\n\nSponsors should conduct nonclinical evaluations in relevant species. Assessing factors for determining a relevant species necessitates considering the specific ERT product and clinical indication. Some additional factors sponsors should consider when determining the most relevant species for testing ERT products include (1) comparability of molecular attributes, including the interspecies homology of the enzyme and the cell-surface receptors mediating uptake of the circulating ERT product; (2) distribution of the native enzyme and/or ERT product compared with that of humans; and (3) feasibility of using the planned clinical delivery systemor procedure, as appropriate. Sponsors should also justify the appropriateness of each animal species.3\n\nFootnote 3: We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) for animal use in testing when feasible. FDA encourages sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering a nonanimal testing method believed to be suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. FDA will consider if the alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nii.1.3 Animal Models of Disease\n\nAlthough studies in animal models of human diseases caused by single enzyme defects are not expected to replace clinical studies in humans, they can provide, in selected situations, complementary and supportive information that can facilitate the progression of a human ERT development program. The extent to which the information obtained from such animal models may be relevant to the human disease of interest depends on many factors. To this end, it is desirable that the selected animal disease model displays a phenotype that mimics to a large extent the clinical manifestations and the overall course of the human disease. Greater credibility and relevance can be given to animal data if the metabolic pathways and essential intermediary components are conserved between the selected animal species and humans. It is essential not only that the inactivated animal gene is the same as the human gene but also that the animal and human genes serve the same biological functions and that the metabolic pathways are preserved across species. If reliance on animal data is proposed, the IND should include information supporting the usefulness and/or ability of the models to mimic the target disease population.\n\nAnimal models of disease may provide proof of concept that the ERT of interest has the desired biological effect. They may also help identify a biologically effective dose or doses and dosing regimen or regimens and confirm the effectiveness of the animal dose through studies that measure reduction in tissue substrate levels or other related histopathological changes that can be linked mechanistically to the enzymatic defect. They can further provide evidence of biological activity by demonstrating improvement of the disease manifestations (including effects on survival).\n\nIn addition, studies in animal models can support future reliance on noninvasive biomarkers (e.g., disease-specific substrate levels and/or enzyme-reaction products in the circulation) as long as the rate and extent of improvement of the biomarker levels correlate with a reduction in tissue substrate deposition/tissue damage and/or improvements in organ function. Such biomarkers may later be used as pharmacodynamic markers of disease activity in humans in clinical trials and may even be qualified as surrogate markers.\n\nIf studies in animal models of disease are used to support the safety of an ERT product, sponsors should incorporate safety endpoints in the POC studies. FDA encourages sponsors to discuss the adequacy of study designs (e.g., number of animals used and plans for tissue collection and evaluation) with the review division before initiating the study.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSensors should perform an appropriate nonclinical safety assessment to support the proposed clinical development program. Healthy animals represent the standard test system employed to conduct traditional toxicological studies. For studies to support ERT clinical trials, sponsors can consider study designs that use animal models of disease that incorporate important safety parameters that allow for assessing the potential toxicity of an investigational ERT product. Sponsors should consider POC studies in relevant animal disease models modified to assess toxicology endpoints prospectively, including microscopic examinations of tissues, as support for initiating human clinical trials. Using animal disease models for toxicity testing may also allow sponsors to detect toxicity caused by the interaction of the drug and the disease in ways that would not be observed in healthy animals. To obtain agreement on study design, sponsors should discuss such study designs with the review division before initiating a study.\n\nThe nonclinical safety assessment, whether conducted in healthy animals or in animal disease models, should be sufficiently comprehensive to permit identifying, characterizing, and quantifying potential local and systemic toxicities, their onset (i.e., acute or delayed), the effect of the product dose level on toxicity findings, and the possibility for reversing any toxicities (if applicable).\n\nThe overall design of the nonclinical studies should support the safety of the proposed clinical trial. Nonclinical toxicology study designs should include the following, as applicable:\n\nAn adequate number of animals per sex that are appropriately randomized to each group. The number of animals needed will depend on existing safety concerns for the investigational ERT product, the species, the model, and the delivery system. If safety data are generated from POC studies to support clinical trials, sponsors should use an adequate number of animals to appropriately assess the safety endpoints. FDA recommends sponsors consult with the review division for design of these studies before initiating a study.\n\nAnimals with the appropriate age and developmental status as related to the proposed clinical trial population. When a first-in-human clinical trial for an ERT product will enroll pediatric patients, sponsors should conduct toxicity studies that use juvenile animals before initiating a clinical trial. The major issue is the potential for adverse effects on the developing organ systems in young pediatric patients (e.g., central nervous system, reproductive tract, immune system, and skeletal system). ICH M3(R2) and the guidance for industry Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Pediatric Drug Products (February 2006) provide recommendations for determining the need for juvenile animal studies. Sponsors can submit the protocol for the juvenile animal toxicology studies to the review division for the division's concurrence on appropriate toxicology endpoints before conducting the study. The juvenile animal toxicity studies potentially may be waived when (1) clinical development is initiated in adult patients, (2) there are no specific safety concerns from studies in adult animals or adult patients, and (3) target organs with identified toxicity concerns are not undergoing development at the time of treatment.__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nAppropriate control groups. A control group should be included in all toxicology studies with ERT products. An appropriate control group should be age-matched animals that have been administered the formulation vehicle only. When it is necessary to co-administer an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) to control hypersensitivity reactions to the ERT product, sponsors should include in the study a vehicle control group and a vehicle-plus-antihistamine control group. Sponsors should also provide justification for the specific control group or groups selected.\n\nAppropriate dose levels. Results obtained from POC studies should guide selection of the target dose levels both for nonclinical safety assessment and for clinical development. ICH M3(R2) and its subsequent questions-and-answers document provide considerations for selecting high doses for general toxicity studies. In general, in the absence of frank toxicity, the exposure at the highest doses tested for ERT products should be severalfold greater than the exposure expected at the highest proposed clinical dose regimen. The highest dose level used in nonclinical studies may be restricted because of animal size, tissue volume or size, ROA, or product-manufacturing capacity. Sponsors should provide justification, with supporting data, for the specific dose levels selected.\n\nThe dosing schedule should reflect the expected clinical exposure, to the extent possible.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational Enzyme Replacement Therapy Products- Nonclinical Assessment Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.0619659423828125", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Paragraph 231 of the preamble to the GLPs states: \"The order of disqualification creates a rebuttable presumption that all studies previously conducted by the facility are unacceptable. Paragraph 226 states: \"Studies conducted at facilities that are in substantial compliance will be presumed to be valid.\" Can we presume that studies conducted during a period when a lab is found to be substantially in compliance will be accepted by FDA as valid even if the laboratory is disqualified at a later date?\n\nYes, unless FDA develops information to the contrary.\n4. If a contract laboratory is disqualified because of a study performed for one sponsor, what effect does this have on other studies performed for other sponsors? What about studies underway at the time of disqualification?\n\nFDA will not disqualify a laboratory on the basis of one invalid study. Disqualification is viewed as a most serious regulatory sanction by FDA and will only be imposed when the facts demonstrate that the laboratory is incapable of producing valid scientific data and will not take adequate corrective measures. In the event a laboratory is disqualified, all studies performed by the laboratory, including those in progress are presumed to be unacceptable unless the sponsors of those studies can establish, to the satisfaction of FDA, that the studies were not affected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification.\n5. What steps must be taken by FDA prior to removal of a product from the market because of a rejected study which was pivotal to the assessment of safety?\n\nIf rejection of a study results in insufficient scientific data being available to support a decision on safety for a marketed product, FDA will initiate formal proceedings to withdraw the marketing approval of that product. These proceedings, for drugs, begin with a notice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of FDA's proposal to withdraw approval setting forth the basis for the proposed action and affording affected parties an opportunity for a public hearing on the matter. If a hearing is requested, affected parties will have the opportunity to present additional facts at the hearing for the Agency to consider The Commissioner's decision to withdraw or to continue the approval is based on the facts brought out at the hearing.\n1. What is the regulatory basis for conducting GLP inspections? It would seem that by making the GLPs regulations instead of guidelines, that the attorneys and accountants are managing the studies. How does that produce good science? The GLP regulations are process-oriented; they are designed to assure that the data collected in a nonclinical laboratory study are valid and accurately reflect the responses of the test system. The GLP inspections are necessary to assess the degree of compliance with the GLPs. The science of a study depends on the appropriateness of the design selected to answer the questions raised in the use of the test article as well as the soundness of the conclusions drawn from the data collected in the study. The assessment of the scientific merit of a study is made by scientists.\n2. Does FDA have the authority to audit an ongoing study of a product for which an application for a research or marketing permit has not yet been submitted to FDA? A distinction needs to be made between an audit of a study and a GLP inspection. An audit involves a comparison of raw data with completed reports to identify errors and discrepancies. A GLP inspection involves an assessment of the procedures used to carry out the study and to record and store the data. FDA audits only studies, which have or are intended to be submitted to the Agency. The FDA will, however, look at on-going studies whether or not they involve FDA regulated products for purposes of documenting the laboratory's adherence to GLPs; such an inspection does not, however, constitute a data audit of the study rather it is an audit of the \"process.\"\n3. What happens when a laboratory refuses to permit an inspection of its facilities? If the laboratory is actively conducting studies on investigational new drugs, investigational new animal drugs, or investigational devices, refusal to permit inspection is a violation of section 301(e) or (f) of the Act and the Agency will take whatever action is required to compel inspection. Where the Agency has reason to believe that the laboratory is in fact conducting nonclinical laboratory studies, a letter will issue to the laboratory stating that FDA will not accept any future studies performed by that laboratory in support of a research or marketing application. If the laboratory has not, or is not testing an FDA regulated product, it is also advised to contact the local FDA district office to arrange for an inspection should they anticipate engaging in such safety testing.\n4. What happens if in the course of an inspection of a contract laboratory, the sponsor of the study selected for GLP inspection refuses to permit access to the study records?The FDA investigator will select another study and proceed with the inspection. If the study originally selected for inspection involved an FDA regulated product, the Agency will pursue the matter directly with the sponsor.\n5. If GLP regulations are not retroactive, will FDA audit pre-June 1979 studies? If so, will FDA investigators list non-conformance with GLPs on the FD-483 Notice of Observations associated with those studies?\n\nFDA will continue to audit pre-June 1979 studies for purposes of assessing not only the quality of a particular study, but also the general performance of the laboratory prior to the time when GLP regulations were first proposed in November 1976. This is necessary because many of the marketing applications pending before the Agency contain studies performed prior to 1976.\n\nWhile deviations from the GLPs will be noted in the FD-483 associated with these studies, the Agency will use this information only to make a judgment regarding the scientific acceptability of those studies and will not use the deviations to initiate regulatory action against the laboratory. After the June 1979 effective date, however, deviations from the GLPs could result in regulatory action against both the studies and the laboratories.\n6. Will the GLPs apply to a study, which has been completed prior to the June 20, 1979, effective date for which a final report will not be prepared until after?\n\nThe GLP regulations became effective June 20, 1979, and those portions of studies underway, as of that date, even if only the final report, became subject to the regulations at that time.\n7. Will a laboratory engaged in testing an FDA-regulated product be subject to a GLP inspection if a research or marketing application has not been submitted to the Agency, e.g., a new company developing its first products?\n\nGenerally speaking, FDA inspects only those laboratories, which have conducted studies submitted to the Agency. FDA strongly advises any laboratory which intends to engage in the safety testing of a regulated product, and which has not been previously inspected, to contact the local FDA district office and request a GLP inspection.\n8. Will FDA accept data from a study not conducted in accordance with GLPs for regulatory purposes?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.316017150878906", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Possibility of a chemical interaction. One drug may chemically modify another drug or biologic (e.g., one drug may oxidize, methylate, or ethylate the other drug or biologic). This could result in NMEs with new toxicities.\n\nPossibility that one drug/biologic may compromise the effectiveness of another drug/biologic for a lifesaving therapy.\n\nNonclinical Study Recommendations/General Procedure\n\nIf existing clinical and nonclinical safety data for each separate drug or biologic are sufficient to support the safety of the proposed new indication, including the dose, dosing schedule, duration, and new patient population, then additional nonclinical studies may not be needed.\n\nThe general approach to addressing the safety concerns posed by the testing or marketing of combinations of previously marketed drugs or biologics is illustrated in Figure A. The safety of the combination should be assessed according to the factors listed in section II.A (see Figure A, Boxes 1 to 2). If neither individual drug or biologic product has serious toxicity at exposures well above the proposed clinical exposure or if there is substantial clinical experience with the combination, the FDA may recommend that additional nonclinical studies do not need to be conducted before testing in humans, during initial studies in humans, or at all (Boxes 2 to 3). The Agency's recommendation to conduct nonclinical studies for further development of the combination will depend on what is learned from initial studies in humans or what is known from prior human use of the combination.7 Footnote 7: For example, as previously mentioned, the draft HIV guidance discusses the FDA\u2019s belief that certain antiretroviral therapies previously approved for the treatment of HIV may be approved for concomitant use without additional nonclinical (or clinical) studies, because the clinical safety and efficacy of concomitant use have been evaluated and described in product labels or peer-reviewed literature.\n\nIf after evaluating the available data on the individual drug/biologic products and the potential for drug/biologic interaction there is no evidence to suggest a possible interaction, direct assessment of the combination by testing in animals may not be needed before the first small clinical studies with the combination. Even if an interaction is expected, nonclinical studies may not be necessary if the expected interaction is likely to result in predictable, nonserious, monitorable effects in humans. For example, if a metabolic interaction is predicted, the starting dose could be significantly lowered in humans. Metabolic interactions have been seen for combinations of two biologics. There is a possibility of drugs/biologics affecting the same tissue or biologic target or having a PD interaction.\n\nGenerally, the FDA recommends that sponsors conduct nonclinical toxicity studies before clinical studies are initiated if: (1) the drug products have similar target organ toxicity or PD activity; and (2) either drug product causes serious or nonmonitorable toxicity in animals or humans at exposures near the clinical exposure; or (3) any other reason exists for serious clinical concern (see section II.A). The particular nonclinical studies recommended by the FDA will depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the toxicity and on the concerns identified in section II.A. For assessment of general toxicity, a bridging study may be appropriate, provided the duration is sufficient to elicit the toxicity of concern. For example, a general toxicity bridging study of 3 months' duration could be considered for a chronic indication. The FDA suggests that combination studies include an assessment of several dose levels of the combination and a high dose of each drug alone. Other possible designs can be discussed with the review division. Sponsors are urged to select the doses of each drug used in combination to allow for additive or synergistic effects without unacceptable toxicity in the high-dose groups. Usually, assessment of the drug combination may be conducted in only one species if one of the following conditions exists: (1) toxicity in a particular species has high concordance with human toxicity or the toxicities are similar among species; or (2) one species is a more relevant model for human risk based on other factors such as PK/ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) or expression of the pharmacologic activity. If a sponsor will be conducting only one general toxicity study, the FDA recommends that the sponsor provide justification for the species selected for testing the combination. There may be cases, however, in which the Agency may recommend conducting studies in two species despite one or both of these conditions being met. For example, depending on the results in the first species, a new cause for concern might warrant follow-up studies in a second species, if there is an appropriate second species.\n\nSometimes one of the drugs proposed for the combination will be much more toxic in animals than in humans, such that animals cannot tolerate the combination at doses that produce exposure relevant to the anticipated clinical exposure (e.g., some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics). In those cases, general toxicity studies of the combination could be conducted at a dose giving less exposure than that achieved with the recommended clinical dose of the more toxic drug product, provided that a serious dose-limiting toxicity is achieved in the animals. The timing of the studies should be as described in the ICH guidance for industry M3 Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals.\n\nCombination genotoxicity studies generally will not be necessary if the individual agents have been tested consistent with current standards. Embryo-fetal development studies of the combination should be conducted per the timing described in ICH M3, unless the marketed products are already known to have significant risk for developmental toxicity (e.g., one of the marketed drugs has been assigned a pregnancy category \"D\" or \"X\"). If combination studies are needed, a single study could be conducted in the most appropriate species, based on what is known about the individual drugs or biologics. If a significant risk is only identified for a particular trimester of pregnancy, such as ACE inhibitors during the third trimester, studies to evaluate the effects of exposure to the NME or the combination during other trimesters may be needed.\n\nFor chronic indications, a carcinogenicity study on the drug combination generally will only be recommended if statistically significant incidences of preneoplastic lesions were observed at a new organ or tissue site in nonclinical studies of the combination. Results of the nonclinical studies may be used to recommend modification of the clinical protocol (e.g., starting clinical doses, parameters to monitor) (Box 8).\n\nIII Nonclinical studies for a combination of drugs or biologics when one or more is previously marketed and one is a new molecular entity (figure 2)\n\nThis section addresses the situation in which a sponsor submits an application to develop a combination of two or more drugs or biologics -- one or more previously marketed and one an NME or a combination of drugs and biologics.\n\nGeneral Toxicology Studies\n\nThe Agency generally suggests that nonclinical studies be conducted on the NME for a product that is a combination of an NME and a previously marketed drug or biologic. The FDA believes that the standard battery of nonclinical studies (i.e., genetic toxicology, pharmacology, safety pharmacology, PK/ADME, general toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity) generally will be appropriate for the NME, as described in ICH M3. ICH S6 should be consulted for nonclinical development of biologic products. If genotoxicity studies on the previously marketed product are consistent with current standards, it may be appropriate to conduct genotoxicity studies on only the drug NME portion of the combination.\n\nDepending on the duration of the proposed therapy, the FDA recommends that a sponsor conduct a bridging study of up to 90 days with the combination in the most appropriate species. Studies of shorter duration could be appropriate for shorter clinical studies or for nonchronic indications, per ICH M3. There may be cases, however, where studies in a second species may be appropriate. Because the drug ratio may change during drug development, it is important to design the toxicity studies to provide adequate margins of safety for future clinical studies. For combinations, the FDA recommends that the exposure to the drugs/biologics be at ratios that are relevant to the intended clinical use.\n\nSometimes one of the drugs proposed for the combination will be much more toxic in animals than in humans, such that animals cannot tolerate the combination at doses that produce exposure relevant to the anticipated clinical exposure (e.g., some NSAIDs and antibiotics). In those cases, nonclinical studies of the combination could be conducted at a dose giving less exposure than that achieved with the recommended clinical dose of the more toxic drug product, provided that a serious dose-limiting toxicity is achieved in the animals.\n\nReproductive and Developmental Toxicology\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic Combinations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.594866752624512", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 14: See, for example, the ICH guidances for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals and S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals, and the guidances for industry Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products and INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nFor streamlined drug development programs addressing unmet medical needs for serious bacterial infections, sponsors should provide the following important nonclinical information about the investigational drug:\n\nIn vitro activity of the investigational drug, including the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) from a representative sample of target bacterial pathogens\n\nActivity in appropriate animal models of infection\n\nEvidence for the antibacterial drug's ability to achieve appropriate levels in relevant tissue sites from nonclinical studies (e.g., from appropriate animal models of infection)\n\nThe mechanism of action and whether mechanisms of resistance to other drugs affect its antibacterial activity\n\nThe evaluation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships from animal models of infection, such as the PK/PD index that is associated with efficacy in a relevant animal model and/or in vitro model(s) based on: (1) the area under the unbound plasma concentration time curve over the MIC; (2) maximum unbound plasma concentration over the MIC; (3) time above the MIC; or (4) other appropriate metrics\n\nThe target value of the PK/PD index that is associated with efficacy in the animal model\n\nDose and frequency of administration that was evaluated in in vitro models of infection based on PK parameters obtained from human PK studies\n\n4 What are clinical trial design considerations in a streamlined development program?\n\nDifferent approaches can be used to evaluate an antibacterial drug for the treatment of a serious bacterial disease in patients with an unmet medical need. The approaches outlined below are provided as examples that sponsors may consider using. These approaches are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive; in some cases combining elements from different approaches may be appropriate. Sponsors are encouraged to discuss their specific proposed development programs with the FDA before commencing clinical trials. The following are examples of trial design considerations.\n\nNoninferiority clinical trials\n\nThe efficacy of an investigational drug intended to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients with an unmet medical need can be established on the basis of a noninferiority trial in a population of patients who have treatment options for their serious bacterial disease. The trial population should include patients with severity of illness and/or comorbid conditions that are similar to those of patients who have an unmet medical need to have a finding of safety and efficacy that can be relevant to the patient population with unmet medical need (i.e., patients with infections caused by bacteria resistant to other available antibacterial drugs).15({}^{,})16({}^{,})17\n\nFootnote 15: Patients with unmet need may have greater comorbidities, altered pharmacokinetics, or disease severity that affect treatment effect and patient outcomes. Enrolling patients with these characteristics in the noninferiority trial should increase the generalizability to similar populations of patients who have unmet need.\n\nGiven that the antibacterial drug would be indicated for use only for patients who have limited or no treatment options, the characterization of efficacy in a noninferiority trial could be based on a larger noninferiority margin than is typically recommended in infectious disease-specific guidances but still establishes effectiveness.18 The labeled indication would specifically state that the drug should be reserved for patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options (see the response to Question 17).\n\nFootnote 16: A hierarchical nested noninferiority/superiority analysis can be considered if a sufficient number of patients with infection caused by bacteria resistant to the control drug are expected to be enrolled in the trial. See the response in Question 4.c., Nested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials.\n\nBecause there usually will be few patients, if any, who have an unmet medical need in the noninferiority trial, sponsors may want to consider an additional clinical trial in patients with an unmet medical need.19 The additional clinical trial can be conducted in patients with the specific type of infection studied in the noninferiority trial as well as other types of infections of comparable or greater disease severity. Ideally, a randomized active-controlled trial is the best option, if active control therapy is feasible and ethical, because then comparative safety and efficacy evaluations can be performed. Experience has shown that having a randomized comparator group can be particularly important for interpreting safety data from the trial (in small trials that enroll acutely ill patients, having a comparator group can help in evaluating adverse events that may represent background adverse events in this ill population). This trial does not have to be powered for inference testing. If demonstrating statistical superiority is planned, refer to the response in Question 4.b., Superiority clinical trials.\n\nThe additional clinical trial should collect information on patient comorbidities, disease severity, and pharmacokinetics, with comparisons to the patient population in the noninferiority trial (see the response to Question 7 regarding PK/PD considerations).\n\n4 Superiority clinical trials\n\nAn investigational drug can be compared to best-available active control therapy in a single randomized controlled superiority trial. Sponsors should discuss with the FDA the type of trial design (e.g., a trial enrolling patients who have a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) or who have different types of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated intra-abdominal infection)) and inferential statistical evaluations for a finding of superiority.\n\nThere may not be sufficient historical experience to clearly establish a reliable and reproducible treatment effect of the best available active control antibacterial drug therapy against placebo or no treatment. However, it is likely that it has a treatment effect greater than placebo or no treatment. Given this likelihood, it may be difficult to show unequivocal superiority for the investigational drug and it may be appropriate to use a less stringent statistical finding for superiority. In this case, an efficacy finding less robust than usual would be accepted as evidence of efficacy to enable the drug to be marketed because of the identified unmet medical need.\n\nA superiority trial design can be used to evaluate an antibacterial drug with activity against a single species (or a few species) of bacteria. A sufficient number of patients for enrollment into a trial of a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) may not be available. Patients with infections at more than one body site caused by the bacterial species of interest can be enrolled in the trial, with inferential statistical testing for superiority.\n\nA superiority clinical trial design that relies on an external control population may be appropriate to evaluate efficacy when the untreated morbidity and/or mortality is high and does not vary widely in the patient population with unmet medical need, and the effect of the investigational drug in an unmet medical need population is expected to be large.20 For an externally controlled trial, the control patients should be as similar as possible to the population expected to receive the investigational drug. Patients should have been treated in a similar setting and in a similar time frame, except with respect to the investigational drug therapy. For sponsors considering an externally controlled trial, we recommend randomizing at least a small number of patients to the active control (e.g., through disproportionate randomization of 4:1), if feasible and ethical based on an active control considered to be best-available therapy. This will allow for an assessment of the comparability of the external control to the trial population. Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods can then be used to combine external control data with data from the patients randomized to the active control in assessing differences between treatment groups for the primary comparison.\n\nNested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials\n\nPatients with and without unmet medical need can be included in a nested, active-controlled noninferiority/superiority trial design. Patients should be randomized to the investigational drug or the control drug before the availability of the results of antibacterial drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria causing the patient's infection because of the time required for results from susceptibility testing to become available using current technologies. The trial should include provisions for adjusting the control regimen to provide standard-of-care treatment for patients who are found to have resistant bacterial isolates at baseline. It is essential that adequate procedures be in place to protect patients enrolled in this trial from avoidable exposure to less effective therapy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.67101526260376"], "Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including \"outliers\". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n\nUnless a study falls within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c), specific record requirements are listed in 21 CFR 812.140. In general, the records that are needed are those that provide the data for testing the study hypotheses. Records should contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the collected data.\n\nWe also recommend that investigators:\n\na. Maintain records of all data elements captured in the study, including raw measurements and subject co-variables in the form of demographic and morbidity factors; b. Link every observation recorded to the subject and that person's co-variable data; c. Preserve information obtained for all subjects enrolled and for all specimens collected.\n\nAdditionally, electronic spreadsheets of study data are useful. Given the possible need to review or analyze study data at the most detailed level, electronic spreadsheets may help to minimize review time. For information on electronic records, see the guidance document, \"Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures -- Scope and Application,\" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation\n\nn/Guidances/ucm072322.pdf. There is also a more general guidance document available on electronic records for clinical studies that is entitled \"Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials,\" which can be found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126402.htm.\n\nWhat does FDA recommend be included in the final report of the investigation from the sponsor to all reviewing IRBs (and to FDA for significant risk studies) (21 CFR 812.150(b)(7))?\n\nA final report should be a basic scientific report of the studies conducted, including the results of testing the study hypotheses. This report can be a useful means of providing a simple account of the data collection and study outcome. Such a report can facilitate preparation of the eventual submission for regulatory action, particularly when accompanied by the information included in the investigational plan (see the Glossary for definition).\n\nThe suggested format for the IDE final report, which FDA includes as an enclosure in all IDE approval letters, is found in Appendix 5 of this guidance.\n\nIt should be noted that FDA will consider submission of a marketing application (510(k), PMA, or HDE) to serve as the final report for the IDE. When a study sponsor submits a marketing application in lieu of the final report, the sponsor should still submit a supplement to the IDE stating that the marketing application should be considered the final report for the study.\n\nThe final report for significant risk device investigations must be submitted to the IRBs and/or FDA within six months after termination or completion of the study. 21 CFR 812.150(b)(7).\n\nVII.

SS 360j(g)(7)), that is available to anyone planning to investigate the safety or effectiveness of a class III device (see definition below) or any implant. The purpose of the meeting is to reach agreement on the key parameters of the investigational plan, including the study protocol. The meeting is to be held within 30 days of the receipt of a written request. FDA will document in writing any agreement reached and make it a part of the administrative record. The agreement is binding on FDA and can only be changed with the written agreement of the applicant or when there is a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the device. See 21 U.S.C. SS 360j(g)(7). A guidance document regarding these meetings, \"Early Collaboration Meetings Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and for CDRH Staff,\" is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument\n\ns/ucm073604.htm.\n\nAnalyte specific reagent (ASR) - ASRs are defined as \"antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, specific receptor proteins, ligands, nucleic acid sequences, and similar reagents which, through specific binding or chemical reactions with substances in a specimen, are intended for use in a diagnostic application for identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance or ligand in biological specimens.\" 21 CFR 864.4020(a). ASRs are medical devices that are regulated by FDA. They are subject to general controls, including current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), 21 CFR Part 820, as well as the specific provisions of the ASR regulations (21 CFR 809.10(e), 809.30, 864.4020).\n\nClass I devices - devices for which the general controls of the Act are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. They typically present minimal potential for harm to the user and the person being tested. They are subject to general controls, which include registration and listing, labeling, and adverse event reporting requirements (section 513(a)(1)(A) of the Act). Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to certain limitations found in section 510(l) of the Act and in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. Some are also exempt from the \"Quality Systems Regulation\" found in 21 CFR Part 820. IVD examples of Class I devices include complement reagent, phosphorus (inorganic) test systems (21 CFR 862.1580), and E. coli serological reagents (21 CFR 866.3255).\n\nClass II devices - devices for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness and for which establishment of special controls can provide such assurances. Special controls may include special labeling, mandatory performance standards, risk mitigation measures identified in guidance, and postmarket surveillance (section 513(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Some Class II devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to limitation in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. IVD examples of Class II devices include glucose test systems (21 CFR 862.1345), antinuclear antibody immunological test systems (21 CFR 866.5100), and coagulation instruments (21 CFR 864.5400).\n\nClass III devices - devices for which insufficient information exists to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness through general or special controls. Class III devices are usually those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury (section 513(a)(1)(C) of the Act). Most Class III devices require premarket approval (PMA, see definition below). IVD examples of these include automated PAP smear readers, nucleic acid amplification devices for tuberculosis, and total prostate specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of cancer. A limited number of Class III devices that are equivalent to devices legally marketed before enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 may be marketed through the premarket notification (510(k)) process (see definition below), until FDA has published a requirement for manufacturers of that generic type of device to submit PMA data.\n\nCompassionate use - The compassionate use provision allows access for patients with a serious disease or condition who do not meet the requirements for inclusion in the clinical investigation but for whom the treating physician believes the device may provide a benefit in treating and/or diagnosing their disease or condition. There must be no feasible alternative therapies/diagnostics available. Compassionate use is typically available only for individual patients but also may be used to treat a small group. Prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs.\n\nFurther information can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.791296005249023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Assay Migration Studies for\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostic Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA\n\nStaff\n\nDocument issued on: April 25, 2013\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on January 5, 2009.\n\nFor questions regarding this document contact Sally Hojvat, PhD, CDRH/OIR/DMD, by phone at (301) 796-5455, or by email at sally.hojvat@fda.hhs.gov or Marina V.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA's regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term \"new system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term \"old system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA's Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO).

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Background\n\nThis guidance is intended to describe some statistically appropriate practices for reporting results from different studies evaluating diagnostic tests and identify some common inappropriate practices. The recommendations in this guidance pertain to diagnostic tests where the final result is qualitative (even if the underlying measurement is quantitative). We focus special attention on the practice called discrepant resolution and its associated problems.\n\nOn February 11, 1998, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health convened a joint meeting of the Microbiology, Hematology/Pathology, Clinical Chemistry/Toxicology, and Immunology Devices Panels. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain recommendations on \"appropriate data collection, analysis, and resolution of discrepant results, using sound scientific and statistical analysis to support indications for use of the in vitro diagnostic devices when the new device is compared to another device, a recognized reference method or 'gold standard,' or other procedures not commonly used, and/or clinical criteria for diagnosis.\" Using the input from that meeting, a draft guidance document was developed discussing some statistically valid approaches to reporting results from evaluation studies for new diagnostic devices. The draft guidance was released for public comment March 12, 2003.\n\nFollowing publication of the draft guidance, FDA received 11 comments. Overall, the comments were favorable and requested additional information be included in the final guidance. Some respondents requested greater attention to the use of standard terminology.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCorrect use of terminology for describing performance results is important to ensure safe and effective use of a diagnostic device. Whenever possible, this guidance uses internationally accepted terminology and definitions as compiled in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Harmonized Terminology Database.1 This guidance also uses terms as they are defined in the STARD (_STA_ndards for _R_eporting of _D_iagnostic Accuracy) Initiative.2 The STARD Initiative pertains to studies of diagnostic accuracy. While the STARD Initiative does not specifically address studies designed to demonstrate diagnostic device equivalence, many of the reporting concepts are still applicable.\n\nFootnote 1: This database is publicly available at www.clsi.org.\n\nFootnote 2: See www.consort-statement.org/stardstatement.htm or two articles by Bossuyt et al. 2003a,b.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nWe believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways to contact him, can be found on the Internet at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.\n\n3. Scope\n\nThis document provides guidance for the submission of premarket notification (510(k)) and premarket approval (PMA) applications for diagnostic devices (tests). This guidance addresses the reporting of results from different types of studies evaluating diagnostic devices with two possible outcomes (positive or negative) in PMAs and 510(k)s. The guidance is intended for both statisticians and non-statisticians.\n\nThis guidance does not address the fundamental statistical issues associated with design and monitoring of clinical studies for diagnostic devices.\n\n4. Introduction\n\nThis section provides an explanation of the concepts relevant to this guidance. We note at the outset that evaluation of a new diagnostic test should compare a new product'soutcome (test results) to an appropriate and relevant diagnostic benchmark using subjects/patients from the intended use population; that is, those subjects/patients for whom the test is intended to be used. In STARD, this is called the target population.\n\nOther important concepts and definitions include the following:\n\nTypes of test results\n\nThe method of comparison depends on the nature of the test results. Diagnostic test results (outcomes) are usually classified as either quantitative or qualitative. A quantitative result is a numerical amount or level, while a qualitative result usually consists of one of only two possible responses; for example, diseased or non-diseased, positive or negative, yes or no. This document pertains to diagnostic tests where the final result is qualitative (even if the underlying measurement is quantitative). Quantitative tests and tests with ordinal outcomes (more than two possible outcomes, but ordered) are not discussed here.\n\nWe also assume throughout that your study data do not include multiple samples from single patients.\n\nPurpose of a qualitative diagnostic test\n\nA qualitative diagnostic test (test) is designed to determine whether a target condition is present or absent in a subject from the intended use population. As defined in STARD, the target condition (condition of interest) \"can refer to a particular disease, a disease stage, health status, or any other identifiable condition within a patient, such as staging a disease already known to be present, or a health condition that should prompt clinical action, such as the initiation, modification or termination of treatment.\"\n\nFDA recommends your labeling characterize diagnostic test performance for use by all intended users (laboratories, health care providers, and/or home users).\n\nBenchmarks\n\nFDA recognizes two major categories of benchmarks for assessing diagnostic performance of new qualitative diagnostic tests. These categories are (1) comparison to a reference standard (defined below), or (2) comparison to a method or predicate other than a reference standard (non-reference standard). The choice of comparative method will determine which performance measures may be reported in the label.\n\nDiagnostic accuracy and the reference standard\n\nThe diagnostic accuracy of a new test refers to the extent of agreement between the outcome of the new test and the reference standard. We use the term reference standard as defined in STARD. That is, a reference standard is \"considered to be the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target condition.\" It divides the intended use population into only two groups (condition present or absent) and does not consider the outcome of the new test under evaluation.\n--------------------\nContext title: Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests - Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.2460386753082275", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n\nThe FDA strongly recommends that sponsors discuss proposed migration studies with the Agency early in the product design and testing process in order to determine if the proposed changes are consistent with the considerations that would allow for focused testing. An early contact with the Agency is especially recommended for an assay being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system. For CBER licensed devices, this contact may be through an IND, or protocol review, providing preliminary protocols, data, and justifications prior to performing the migration studies. The size, nature,and scope of migration studies we recommend will depend on a detailed evaluation of the old and new systems, the level of regulation appropriate for the product (e.g., PMA, BLA, or 510(k)), the performance characteristics of the assay, and the design and scope of the analytical testing and clinical trials used to support approval, licensure, or clearance of the assay on the old system.\n\nCritical Considerations for Determining Whether The Migration Studies Paradigm May Apply To A Particular Device\n\nA sponsor should take into account the following critical considerations in determining whether the migration studies approach is appropriate for a particular product, and describe these considerations in the submission:\n\nThe intended use and indications for use for the new system should be unchanged from the old system, except for inclusion of the new system.\n\nReagent and assay parameters (e.g., cutoff) should be unchanged, except for very minor differences (such as small changes in incubation times) in order to optimize the assay on the new system. However, the sponsor should provide evidence that the changes do not compromise the assay's performance.\n\nSome assay technologies may not be good candidates for the migration studies paradigm (e.g., assays with relatively high imprecision near the assay cutoff).\n\nAssay and system technologies should remain unchanged. All biochemical (e.g., antibody and antigen interactions or DNA probe construct) and physical detection (e.g., colorimetric, chemiluminescence, or dye binding) technologies should be unchanged from the old system. Minor differences in hardware instrumentation may be appropriate and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThere should be no expected change to the assay performance when run on the new system. However, actual changes will be evaluated in the context of their impact on the clinical use of the assay. Due to the limited number of positive and negative samples, the migration studies approach is not appropriate to support changes in clinical performance claims.\n\n5 Additional Considerations\n\nIn addition to addressing each of the critical considerations noted in Section 4, you should also include the information listed below to demonstrate the applicability of migration studies to the transfer of the assay from the old system to the new system. The information in your submission should include, but is not limited to, the following:Footnote 5: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089543.html\n\nContents\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDevice description, including functional block diagrams and hardware and software components for both the old and new systems to allow an evaluation of the changes to the new system when compared to the old system.\n\nA similarities and differences table for a side-by-side comparison of assay parameters and hardware/software functions, requirements and design.\n\nA risk analysis of the new system (software/hardware/assay) using relevant guidance documents [6, 7].\n\nSummaries of software data validating functional operation of alerts and alarms in real or simulated circumstances.\n\nSystem Operator Manual(s): If the new system was previously approved or licensed with analytes other than the one under consideration, a new review of the System Operator Manual may only be called for if changes have been made that impact safety and effectiveness, or if there are assay-specific sections or changes.\n\nProposed modifications to the labeling that appropriately describe respective prior data and new migration study information. The sponsor should consult with FDA when determining whether a dual or separate package insert will be appropriate. Inclusion of the old system's analytical and performance data should be included where appropriate.\n\nIn addition, the sponsor should include documentation on software and instrumentation for the new system. When appropriate for the device, this documentation should meet all recommendations for the appropriate Level of Concern[7]. To further minimize risk, studies should be performed on the final production model of the new system that is intended to be marketed. Likewise, studies should be performed using the final release candidate of the software and any differences between the release candidate and the final release should be evaluated using a risk based approach and included in the submission for FDA review.\n\nIf you are using the migration paradigm to migrate an approved Class III assay to an instrument that has not previously been cleared or approved, or to move an approved Class III manual assay to an instrument not previously cleared or approved, you should submit documentation describing the hardware and software design controls, including design verification and validation, along with other appropriate Quality Systems documentation. (See 21 CFR Part 820 - Quality System Regulation). For a general discussion of the Quality System information that FDA recommends including in premarket applications please also refer to the guidance document available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089543.htmlm070897.htm. In addition, if the instrument manufacturing site has not been inspected as part of the original class III assay approval process, then a site inspection may be conducted.\n\nVI Assay Migration Studies\n\nThis section outlines specific studies that may be appropriate to support assay migration for in vitro diagnostic devices. Before preparing to use the migration studies approach, you should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the definitions in this guidance. Specifically, for the purposes of this guidance, qualitative assays are those that use numeric values (e.g., signal, S/CO), to determine nominal categorical assay results (e.g., positive or negative). Quantitative assays determine numeric values which are referenced to a measuring interval, and standards that allow determination of analyte concentrations. Section VI.A below describes studies for qualitative assays; Sections VI.B and VI.C address quantitative assays and semi-quantitative assays respectively; and Section VI.D addresses point-of-care assays. Special considerations for blood screening assays are covered in Appendix I, \"Migration Studies for Blood Donor Screening Assays.\"\n\nMigration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5631566047668457", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/assay-migration-studies-vitro-diagnostic-devices.\n\nOption 3: As an alternative to comparison study designs, for certain test systems, flex and human factors engineering studies may provide sufficient assurance that the change in user populations and environment of use between non-waived and waived settings will not adversely impact the results provided by the candidate test; i.e., that the likelihood of erroneous results by the users is negligible. Possible study design approaches that may be suitable include flex study designs described in section IV above and human factor study designs described in FDA's guidance \"Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineeringto Medical Devices.\"23 FDA believes this approach is generally appropriate for test systems for which:\n\nFootnote 23: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices.\n\ncollection of a specimen is either always performed by a professional (for example, an endocervical swab collected by a doctor) or always by a patient (for example, a urine specimen collected by the patient), and\n\nother pre-analytical steps are very simple (for example, placement of the entire specimen in the analyzer), and\n\nintended use patient populations are sufficiently similar.\n\nAdditionally, another scenario where this option may be appropriate is a CLIA waiver application for a modification of a previously waived test system where the Quick Reference Guide was not modified (or minimally modified). FDA encourages manufacturers considering modification of a test system previously waived by application to contact FDA through a Pre-Submission to discuss planned modifications, as well as study designs and analyses to validate that the modified test system meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver.24\n\nFootnote 24: A Pre-Submission is a type of Q-Submission. For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nOption 4: Comparison study designs in which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained operators. This option is also useful for Dual Submissions where a 510(k) and CLIA waiver are being sought concurrently.\n\nFor general recommendations on comparison study design and analysis for Options 1 and 4, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as:\n\nFor quantitative tests: CLSI EP21,25 CLSI EP27.26 Footnote 25: CLSI EP21 Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative tests: CLSI EP12.27 Footnote 26: CLSI EP27 How to Construct and Interpret an Error Grid for Quantitative Diagnostic Assays.\n\nFor Options 1, 2, and 4, if sufficient valid scientific evidence on the imprecision of the test and the performance of the test at low levels (limit of detection and limit of quantitation) when performed by untrained operators is not available from the studies described above, additional studies should be performed to allow comparison of the imprecision and limit of detection/limit of quantitation of the test when performed by untrained and trained operators. We recommend following appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g., CLSI EP05,28 CLSI EP12, CLSI EP1729) for these studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to submit a Pre-Submission to obtain feedback from FDA on planned study designs prior to conducting the study. FDA welcomes discussion of additional study design approaches besides the four options presented in this guidance.30\n\nFootnote 30: For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The O-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nAppendix B Considerations in Satisfying CLIA Waiver Requirements\n\nOne statutory criteria that a test can meet to obtain a CLIA waiver centers on the simplicity of the test and whether the user can conduct the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.31 All tests have some likelihood of erroneous results, but whether the likelihood of erroneous results in the hands of waived test users is negligible will vary from test to test depending on a number of factors. These factors include intended use, context of use (e.g., patient population, use environment), and the probable benefit(s) and probable risk(s)/harm(s) associated with waived use of the test. FDA intends for its approach to benefit-risk considerations to be consistent with the principles expressed, to the extent applicable, in FDA's other guidances.32 Accordingly, the appropriate acceptance criteria for the studies performed using the design options described above will vary from test to test. For example, for a qualitative test performed following study Options 1 or 2, the minimum level of agreement between results of the test in the hands of untrained and trained users for demonstrating comparable performance should generally be higher for a test for which erroneous results in waived settings are associated with a higher extent of probable patient risk/harm than for tests with lower probable risk/harm in waived settings.\n\nFootnote 31: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263a(d)(3)(A).\n\nFootnote 32: See, for example, \u201c_Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/benefit-risk-factors-consider-when-determining-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, and \u201c_Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/factors-consider-when-making-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approval-and-de.\n\nAppendix C General Study Design Considerations\n\nFor all study design options, FDA recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as closely as possible, actual CLIA-waived settings, patients, samples, and test operators. Therefore, study designs should include the following:\n\nTesting sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.\n\nSubject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).\n\nIntended sample type and matrix.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUntrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.\n\nTesting should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.\n\nTesting sites\n\nYou should conduct the study to support CLIA waiver at a minimum of three sites that are representative of both the intended use patient population and the intended operators in CLIA-waived settings. Generally, the sites should include different demographic and geographic locations (e.g., outpatient clinic, physician's office), since patient populations and intended operators typically vary among different demographic locations. In your CLIA waiver application, you should present a brief description of each site, including its name, address, and the date the study was performed. If there were sites that were included at the beginning, but then did not complete the study, you should provide a brief explanation for why those sites did not complete the study.\n\nFor study Options 1 and 2, trained operators may perform testing at the same sites as the untrained operators, or at a different laboratory site. For study Option 4, trained operators should perform testing with the comparative method at an appropriate laboratory site.\n\nOperators\n\nUntrained operators\n\nThe study should include 1-3 untrained operators at each site and at least nine (9) untrained operators across all sites. You should ensure that the untrained operator study participants enrolled represent anticipated operators of the device you propose for CLIA waiver. Untrained operators should have limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing and should not have previous training or experience with the candidate test, but may have limited experience with other waived or home use tests. Untrained operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties. We recommend that you record and tabulate the education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each untrained operator to demonstrate that these participants meet the definition of intended operators and include this in your CLIA waiver application. In addition, for each study site, we recommend you report the same information on other personnel that were available at the testing site but that were not chosen to participate.\n\nTrained operators\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.7565107345581055", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: A similar approach should be adopted to exploring the influence of outliers, the statistical definition of which is, to some extent, arbitrary. Clear identification of a particular value as an outlier is most convincing when justified medically as well as statistically, and the medical context will then often define the appropriate action. Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favor any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully updated during blind review. If no procedure for dealing with outliers was foreseen in the trial protocol, one analysis with the actual values and at least one other analysis eliminating or reducing the outlier effect should be performed and differences between their results discussed.\n\nData Transformation (5.4)\n\nThe decision to transform key variables prior to analysis is best made during the design of the trial on the basis of similar data from earlier clinical trials. Transformations (e.g., square root, logarithm) should be specified in the protocol and a rationale provided, especially for the primary variable(s). The general principles guiding the use of transformations to ensure that the assumptions underlying the statistical methods are met are to be found in standard texts; conventions for particular variables have been developed in a number of specific clinical areas. The decision on whether and how to transform a variable should be influenced by the preference for a scale that facilitates clinical interpretation.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to other derived variables, such as the use of change from baseline, percentage change from baseline, the area under the curve of repeated measures, or the ratio of two different variables. Subsequent clinical interpretation should be carefully considered, and the derivation should be justified in the protocol. Closely related points are made in section II.2.2.\n\nEstimation, Confidence Intervals, and Hypothesis Testing (5.5)\n\nThe statistical section of the protocol should specify the hypotheses that are to be tested and/or the treatment effects that are to be estimated in order to satisfy the primary objectives of the trial. The statistical methods to be used to accomplish these tasks should be described for the primary (and preferably the secondary) variables, and the underlying statistical model should be made clear. Estimates of treatment effects should be accompanied by confidence intervals, whenever possible, and the way in which these will be calculated should be identified. A description should be given of any intentions to use baseline data to improve precision or to adjust estimates for potential baseline differences, for example, by means of analysis of covariance.\n\nIt is important to clarify whether one- or two-sided tests of statistical significance will be used and, in particular, to justify prospectively the use of one-sided tests. If hypothesis tests are not considered appropriate, then the alternative process for arriving at statistical conclusions should be given. The issue of one-sided or two-sided approaches to inference is controversial, and a diversity of views can be found in the statistical literature. The approach of setting Type I errors for one-sided tests at half the conventional Type I error used in two-sided tests is preferable in regulatory settings. This promotes consistency with the two-sided confidence intervals that are generally appropriate for estimating the possible size of the difference between two treatments.\n\nThe particular statistical model chosen should reflect the current state of medical and statistical knowledge about the variables to be analyzed as well as the statistical design of the trial. All effects to be fitted in the analysis (for example, in analysis of variance models) should be fully specified, and the manner, if any, in which this set of effects might be modified in response to preliminary results should be explained. The same considerations apply to the set of covariates fitted in an analysis of covariance. (See also section V.G.) In the choice of statistical methods, due attention should be paid to the statistical distribution of both primary and secondary variables. When making this choice (for example between parametric and nonparametric methods), it is important to bear in mind the need to provide statistical estimates of the size of treatment effects together with confidence intervals (in addition to significance tests).\n\nThe primary analysis of the primary variable should be clearly distinguished from supporting analyses of the primary or secondary variables. Within the statistical section of the protocol or the statistical analysis plan there should also be an outline of the way in which data other than the primary and secondary variables will be summarized and reported. This should include a reference to any approaches adopted for the purpose of achieving consistency of analysis across a range of trials, for example, for safety data.\n\nModeling approaches that incorporate information on known pharmacological parameters, the extent of protocol compliance for individual subjects, or other biologically based data may provide valuable insights into actual or potential efficacy, especially with regard to estimation of treatment effects. The assumptions underlying such models should always be clearly identified, and the limitations of any conclusions should be carefully described.\n\nAdjustment of Significance and Confidence Levels (5.6)\n\nWhen multiplicity is present, the usual frequentist approach to the analysis of clinical trial data may necessitate an adjustment to the Type I error. Multiplicity may arise, for example, from multiple primary variables (see section II.B.2), multiple comparisons of treatments, repeated evaluation over time, and/or interim analyses (see section IV.E). Methods to avoid or reduce multiplicity are sometimes preferable when available, such as the identification of the key primary variable (multiple variables), the choice of a critical treatment contrast (multiple comparisons), and the use of a summary measure such as area under the curve (repeated measures). In confirmatory analyses, any aspects of multiplicity that remain after steps of this kind have been taken should be identified in the protocol; adjustment should always be considered and the details of any adjustment procedure or an explanation of why adjustment is not thought to be necessary should be set out in the analysis plan.\n\nSubgroups, Interactions, and Covariates (5.7)\n\nThe primary variable(s) is often systematically related to other influences apart from treatment. For example, there may be relationships to covariates such as age and sex, or there may be differences between specific subgroups of subjects, such as those treated at the different centers of a multicenter trial. In some instances, an adjustment for the influence of covariates or for subgroup effects is an integral part of the planned analysis and hence should be set out in the protocol. Pretrial deliberations should identify those covariates and factors expected to have an important influence on the primary variable(s), and should consider how to account for these in the analysis to improve precision and to compensate for any lack of balance between treatment groups. If one or more factors are used to stratify the design, it is appropriate to account for those factors in the analysis. When the potential value of an adjustment is in doubt, it is often advisable to nominate the unadjusted analysis as the one for primary attention, the adjusted analysis being supportive. Special attention should be paid to center effects and to the role of baseline measurements of the primary variable. It is not advisable to adjust the main analyses for covariates measured after randomization because they may be affected by the treatments.\n\nThe treatment effect itself may also vary with subgroup or covariate. For example, the effect may decrease with age or may be larger in a particular diagnostic category of subjects. In some cases such interactions are anticipated or are of particular prior interest (e.g., geriatrics); hence a subgroup analysis or a statistical model including interactions is part of the planned confirmatory analysis. In most cases, however, subgroup or interaction analyses are exploratory and should be clearly identified as such; they should explore the uniformity of any treatment effects found overall. In general, such analyses should proceed first through the addition of interaction terms to the statistical model in question, complemented by additional exploratory analysis within relevant subgroups of subjects, or within strata defined by the covariates. When exploratory, these analyses should be interpreted cautiously. Any conclusion of treatment efficacy (or lack thereof) or safety based solely on exploratory subgroup analyses is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nH. Integrity of Data and Computer Software Validity (5.8)\n\nThe credibility of the numerical results of the analysis depends on the quality and validity of the methods and software (both internally and externally written) used both for data management (data entry, storage, verification, correction, and retrieval) and for processing the data statistically. Data management activities should therefore be based on thorough and effective standard operating procedures. The computer software used for data management and statistical analysis should be reliable, and documentation of appropriate software testing procedures should be available.\n\nVI. EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY\n\nA. Scope of Evaluation (6.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.805552959442139"], "Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor's obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency's view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject's decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB's primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor's need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n\"A sponsor's preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval.\" The effect of the IRB's NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor's wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency's policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.4099652767181396", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Research interactions that involve no more than minimal risk to subjects (e.g., quality of life surveys); and\n\nCollection of follow-up data from procedures or interventions that would have been done as part of routine clinical practice to monitor a subject for disease progression or recurrence, regardless of whether the procedures or interventions are described in the research protocol.\n\nIn contrast, FDA interprets \"long-term follow-up\" to exclude:\n\nResearch interventions that would not have been performed for clinical purposes, even if the research interventions involve no more than minimal risk.\n\nOf note, some studies that are not eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a) at the time of continuing review may be eligible for expedited review under one of the other expedited review categories. For example, if a study's only remaining activity involves long-term follow-up of subjects by drawing 15 ml of blood once annually for a test that is not part of routine clinical practice, such research would not be eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a), but might be eligible for expedited review under category (2).\n\nExpedited review category (8)(b)\n\nIRBs conducting continuing review should be aware that if a study previously received expedited continuing review under category (8)(b), but has now begun enrolling subjects, the study may need to be referred for review by the IRB at a convened meeting. The criterion that \"no additional risks have been identified\" is interpreted by FDA to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB has identified any additional risks in the research from any relevant source20 since the IRB's most recent prior review.\n\nFootnote 20: For example, \u201cany relevant source\u201d would include a review of scientific literature or adverse event reports by the IRB or investigator, as well as communication with FDA or the sponsor.\n\nExpedited review category (8)(c)\n\nFDA notes that the process for conducting continuing review of research eligible under expedited review category (8)(c) can be accomplished through a simple, abbreviated process. For example, if the study is no longer enrolling subjects, all subjects have completed all protocol required visits, and no new data is being collected, and the investigator's sole activity is data analysis, the investigator, as part of the continuing review process, could provide to the IRB the following statement regarding the research: \"The study only involves data analysis, which is proceeding in accordance with the IRB-approved research protocol, and there are no problems to report.\" This statement could be provided by email or as part of a standard continuing review application form. Upon receipt of such a statement from the investigator, the IRB chairperson, or other member(s) designated by the chairperson, under the expedited review procedure, may approve continuation of the research project for another year without further deliberation or review.\n\nOnce the data collection from all trial sites is complete and the overall study results database has been locked and the only remaining activity is analysis of the aggregate data by the study sponsor, further continuing review of the research is generally no longer required.\n\n4.4.2 Expedited Review Category (9)\n\nSimilar to review category (1)21 for initial review, under category (9), an expedited review procedure may be used for the continuing review of research previously approved by the IRB at a convened meeting that meets the following conditions:\n\nFootnote 21: Category 1 research addresses \u201c(1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met: (a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)\n\nThe research is not conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application or an investigational device exemption (IDE);\n\nExpedited review categories (2) through (8) do not apply to the research;\n\nThe IRB has documented at a convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk to the subjects; and\n\nNo additional risks have been identified.\n\nWith regard to the third condition, the IRB at a convened meeting must have determined that either (a) the research project as a whole involved no more than minimal risk, or (b) the remaining research activities present no more than minimal risk to human subjects. With regard to multi-site studies, the fourth condition, that no additional risks have been identified, is interpreted to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB at a particular institution has identified any additional risks of the research based on information from any other institution engaged in the research project or from any other relevant source since the IRB's most recent prior review.\n\nFrequency of Continuing Review\n\nUnder 21 CFR 56.108(a)(2) and 56.109(f), the IRB must determine the frequency of continuing review for each clinical investigation to ensure the continued protection of the rights and welfare of research subjects. FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.109(f) require an IRB to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk posed to the subjects, but not less than once a year.\n\nMore frequent review (i.e., more frequently than once per year) is appropriate, for example, when the risks to subjects require close monitoring. The IRB should consider the factors set forth below when deciding on an appropriate interval for continuing review. These factors should be outlined in the IRB's written procedures for deciding on the frequency of continuing review:\n\nThe nature of and any risks posed by the clinical investigation;\n\nThe degree of uncertainty regarding the risks involved;\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe vulnerability of the subject population;\n\nThe experience of the clinical investigator in conducting clinical research;\n\nThe IRB's previous experience with that investigator and/or sponsor (e.g., compliance history, previous problems with the investigator obtaining informed consent, prior complaints from subjects about the investigator);\n\nThe projected rate of enrollment; and\n\nWhether the study involve novel therapies.\n\nAt the time of initial approval of the study, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the investigator of the interval at which continuing review will occur (at least annually) and the date by which continuing review must occur. Similarly, at the time of continuing review, the IRB should consider whether the current frequency of continuing review for the study is adequate or should be adjusted. In addition to specifying a time interval, the IRB may also specify a subject enrollment number as a threshold for determining when continuing review is to occur. For example, at the time of initial review and approval of a high-risk clinical trial, the IRB might require that continuing review occur either in 6 months or after 5 subjects have been enrolled, whichever occurs first. However, if the continuing review interval is described in relation to a subject enrollment number, it must at a minimum also provide for continuing review annually, regardless of the number of subjects enrolled at that time; it is therefore not acceptable to describe the review interval solely in relation to a number of subjects enrolled. The minutes of IRB meetings should clearly document the approval period (continuing review interval).\n\nThe IRB's determinations regarding the approval of research must be communicated to the investigator in writing (21 CFR 56.109(e)). This written determination should also notify the investigator of the required interval for, and expected date of, continuing review.\n\nDetermining the Effective Date of Initial IRB Approval and the Dates for Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review must occur at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less frequently than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should establish written procedures for informing investigators of the FDA's regulations and the IRB's own policies and procedures on continuing review requirements. (See 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) & (2).) This applies whether a study is reviewed by the convened IRB or through an expedited process.\n\nThe IRB's written procedures should describe how the IRB determines the effective date of approval for the study and how the date and period of approval will be communicated to the clinical investigator.\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research Without Conditions at a\n\nConvened Meeting\n\nWhen the IRB conducts the initial review of a study at a convened meeting and approves the research for one year without requiring either (a) changes to the protocol or informed consent document(s), or (b) submission of clarifications or additional documents, the effective date of the initial approval is the date of that IRB meeting. In such circumstances, the expiration date of theinitial approval period and the date by which the first continuing review must occur may be as late as one year after the date of the IRB meeting at which the research initially was approved (21 CFR 56.109(f)).\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research With Conditions at a Convened IRB Meeting Without Requiring Further Review at a Subsequent Convened Meeting\n\nA much more common scenario is when an IRB conducting the initial review of a research project at a convened meeting takes the following set of actions:\n\nApproves the project for one year;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6647751331329346", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator's responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution's IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution's IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be \"men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.\"1 In addition, IRB members must \"be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice\" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution's own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution's own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution's IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution's IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution's IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution's IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution's IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution's IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.2714829444885254", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ExpandedAccessCompassionateUse/uc m429610.htm.\n\nUnder individual patient expanded access INDs, the physician who submits an IND is considered a sponsor-investigator (as defined in SS 312.3) and is responsible for complying with the responsibilities for both sponsors and investigators to the extent they are applicable to the expanded access use, including submitting IND safety reports8 and annual reports and maintaining adequate drug disposition records. The responsibilities of sponsors and investigators are described in subpart D of 21 CFR part 312 and in related guidance documents, for example, in the guidance for industry Investigator Responsibilities--Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects.\n\nFootnote 8: For additional information about FDA\u2019s IND safety reporting requirements, please see the guidance for industry and investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe informed consent requirements in 21 CFR part 50 apply to treatment provided to patients under expanded access INDs, and informed consent must be obtained before initiating treatment, including in the case of emergency use, unless one of the exceptions found in part 50 applies.9 Additionally, the institutional review board (IRB) requirements found in 21 CFR part 56 apply (see SS 312.305(c)(4)), and IRB approval must be obtained before starting treatment under an expanded access IND unless it is for emergency use (in which case the IRB must be notified of the emergency expanded access use within 5 working days of treatment (SS 56.104(c)).10 Upon request, FDA intends to allow for waivers of the requirement for review and approval at a convened IRB meeting for individual patient expanded access INDs where the IRB chairperson or another designated IRB member provides concurrence, as described in the next paragraph.\n\nFootnote 9: For information on informed consent in general, see the draft guidance for IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors Informed Consent Information Sheet. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic. For additional information on the part 50 informed consent exceptions, see the guidance for institutional review boards, clinical investigators, and sponsors Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research.\n\nFootnote 10: An IRB means any board, committee, or other group formally designated by an institution to review, to approve the initiation of, and to conduct periodic review of biomedical research involving human subjects. The primary purpose of IRB review is to assure that the rights and welfare of human subjects are protected, including by determining that informed consent is obtained in accordance with and to the extent required by Federal requirements. Institutions may have their own IRB to oversee human subjects research conducted within the institution or by the staff of the institution. If the physician does not have access to a local IRB, an independent IRB may be used. The Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 Office for Human Research Protections maintains a database of registered IRBs.

However, a physician submitting an individual patient expanded access IND using Form FDA 1571 may include a separate waiver request with the application.\n\nForm FDA 3926 and accompanying instructions may be found on FDA's website at https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/default.htm.\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/default.htm.\n\nIV Procedures and Timeline for Processing Form FDA 3926\n\nIn a non-emergency situation, after receiving Form FDA 3926 (i.e., the IND), FDA will assign an individual IND number to the IND and will either allow the treatment use to proceed or put the application on clinical hold (see SS 312.42). The IND will go into effect (i.e., treatmentwith the investigational drug may proceed) after FDA notifies the physician or, if no notification occurs, 30 days after FDA receives the completed Form FDA 3926. FDA generally provides the sponsor with notification acknowledging the complete submission. If the treatment use is not allowed to proceed, FDA generally will notify the physician of this decision initially by telephone (or other rapid means of communication) and will follow up with a written letter that details the reasons for FDA's decision to place the IND on clinical hold.\n\nIf there is an emergency and authorization of the expanded access use is requested before a written submission can be made, the physician must explain how the expanded access use will meet the criteria of SSS 312.305(a) and 312.310(a), as described previously in section II. In these situations, FDA may authorize the expanded access use of the investigational drug, and treatment may begin before FDA's receipt of the written submission (including the LOA), but the physician must agree to submit an expanded access submission within 15 working days of FDA's authorization of the expanded access use (SS 312.310(d)). When treatment involves the emergency use of an investigational drug and approval from an IRB cannot be obtained before treatment, treatment may begin without prior IRB approval provided the IRB is notified of the emergency expanded access use within 5 working days of treatment (SS 56.104).\n\nSecure email between FDA and sponsors is useful for informal communications when confidential information may be included in the message (e.g., confidential patient information). Parties who would like to establish secure email with FDA should email a request to\n\nSecureEmail@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nV Paperwork reduction act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). The time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 45 minutes per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or suggestions for reducing this burden to:\n\nOffice of Medical Policy, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Bldg. 51, rm. 6337, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information in 21 CFR part 312 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0014.\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control number for this information collection is 0910-0814 (expires 05/31/2022 (Note: Expiration date updated 01/07/2021)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Individual Patient Expanded Access Applications- Form FDA 3926 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9006595611572266", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: [See Conditions for IRB Use of Expedited Review - Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216), Notices (/about-fda/page-not-found)]\n\n21. The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a \"primary reviewer\" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe \"primary reviewer\" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n\nSome IRBs are also exploring the use of electronic submissions and computer access for IRB members. Whatever system the IRB develops and uses, it must ensure that each study receives an adequate review and that the rights and welfare of the subjects are protected.\n\n22. Are sponsors allowed access to IRB written procedures, minutes and membership rosters?\n\nThe FDA regulations do not require public or sponsor access to IRB records. However, FDA does not prohibit the sponsor from requesting IRB records. The IRB and the institution may establish a policy on whether minutes or a pertinent portion of the minutes are provided to sponsors.\n\nBecause of variability, each IRB also needs to be aware of State and local laws regarding access to IRB records.\n\nMust an investigator's brochure be included in the documentation when an IRB reviews an investigational drug study?\n\nFor studies conducted under an investigational new drug application, an investigator's brochure is usually required by FDA [21 CFR 312.23(a)(5) and 312-55]. Even though 21 CFR part 56 does not mention the investigator's brochure by name, much of the information contained in such brochures is clearly required to be reviewed by the IRB. The regulations do outline the criteria for IRB approval of research. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(1) requires the IRB to assure that risks to the subjects are minimized. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2) requires the IRB to assure that the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits. The risks cannot be adequately evaluated without review of the results of previous animal and human studies, which are summarized in the investigator's brochure.\n\nThere is no specific regulatory requirement that the Investigator's Brochure be submitted to the IRB. There are regulatory requirements for submission of information which normally is included in the Investigator's Brochure. It is common that the Investigator's Brochure is submitted to the IRB, and the IRB may establish written procedures which require its submission. Investigator's Brochures may be part of the investigational plan that the IRB reviews when reviewing medical device studies.\n\nTo what extent is the IRB expected to actively audit and monitor the performance of the investigator with respect to human subject protection issues?\n\nFDA does not expect IRBs to routinely observe consent interviews, observe the conduct of the study or review study records. However, 21 CFR 56.109(f) gives the IRB the authority to observe, or have a third party observe, the consent process and the research. When and if the IRB is concerned about the conduct of the study or the process for obtaining consent, the IRB may consider whether, as part of providing adequate oversight of the study, an active audit is warranted.\n\nHow can a sponsor know whether an IRB has been inspected by FDA, and the results of the inspection?\n\nThe Division of Scientific Investigations, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, maintains an inventory of the IRBs that have been inspected, including dates of inspection and classification. The Division recently began including the results of inspections assigned by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This information is available through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) procedures. Once an investigational file has been closed, the correspondence between FDA and the IRB and the narrative inspectional report are also available under FOI.\n\nIf an IRB disapproves a study submitted to it, and it is subsequently sent to another IRB for review, should the second IRB be told of the disapproval? Yes. When an IRB disapproves a study, it must provide a written statement of the reasons for its decision to the investigator and the institution [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. If the study is submitted to a second IRB, a copy of this written statement should be included with the study documentation so that it can make an informed decision about the study. 21 CFR 56.109(a) requires an IRB to \"... review... all research activities [emphasis added]...\" The FDA regulations do not prohibit submission of a study to another IRB following disapproval. However, all pertinent information about the study should be provided to the second IRB. 27. May an independent IRB review a study to be conducted in an institution with an IRB? Generally, no. Most institutional IRB have jurisdiction over all studies conducted within that institution. An independent IRB may become the IRB of record for such studies only upon written agreement with the administration of the institution or the in-house IRB. 28. Could an IRB lose its quorum when members with a conflict of interest leave the room for deliberation and voting on a study? Yes. \"The quorum is the count of the number of members present. If the number present falls below a majority, the quorum fails. The regulations only require that a member who is conflicted not participate in the deliberations and voting on a study on which he or she is conflicted. The IRB may decide whether an individual should remain in the room.\" 29. Does FDA expect the IRB chair to sign the approval letters? FDA does not specify the procedure that IRBs must use regarding signature of the IRB approval letter. The written operating procedures for the IRB should outline the procedure that is followed. 30. Does FDA prohibit direct communication between sponsors and IRBs? It is important that a formal line of communication be established between the clinical investigator and the IRB. Clinical investigators should report adverse events directly to the responsible IRB, and should send progress reports directly to that IRB. However, FDA does not prohibit direct communication between the sponsor and the IRB, and recognizes that doing so could result in more efficient resolution of some problems. FDA does require direct communication between the sponsors and the IRBs for certain studies of medical devices and when the 21 CFR 50.24 informed consent waiver has been invoked. Sponsors and IRBs are required to communicate directly for medical device studies under 21 CFR 812.2, 812.66 and 812.150(b). For informed consent waiver studies, direct communication between sponsors and IRBs is required under 21 CFR 50.24(e), 56.109(e), 56.109(g), 56.109(g), 312.54(b), 312.130(d), 812.38(b)(4) and 812.47(b).\n\nIV IRB Records\n\n31. Are annual IRB reviews required when all studies are reviewed by the IRB each quarter?\n\nThe IRB records for each study's initial and continuing review should note the frequency (not to exceed one year) for the next continuing review in either months or other conditions, such as after a particular number of subjects are enrolled.\n\nAn IRB may decide, to review all studies on a quarterly basis. If every quarterly report contains sufficient information for an adequate continuing review and is reviewed by the IRB under procedures that meet FDA requirements for continuing review, FDA would not require an additional \"annual\" review.\n\n21 CFR 56.115(a)(1) requires that the IRB maintain copies of \"research proposals reviewed.\" Is the \"research proposal\" the same as the formal study protocol that the investigator receives from the sponsor of the research?\n\nYes. The IRB should receive and review all research activities [21 CFR 56.109(a)]. The documents reviewed should include the complete documents received from the clinical investigator, such as the protocol, the investigator's brochure, a sample consent document and any advertising intended to be seen or heard by prospective study subjects. Some IRBs also require the investigator to submit an institutionally-developed protocol summary form. A copy of all documentation reviewed is to be maintained for at least three years after completion of the research at that institution [21 CFR 56.115(b)]. However, when the IRB makes changes, such as in the wording of the informed consent document, only the finally approved copy needs to be retained in the IRB records.\n\n33.

Are annual IRB reviews required when all studies are reviewed by the IRB each quarter?\n\nThe IRB records for each study's initial and continuing review should note the frequency (not to exceed one year) for the next continuing review in either months or other conditions, such as after a particular number of subjects are enrolled.\n\nAn IRB may decide, to review all studies on a quarterly basis. If every quarterly report contains sufficient information for an adequate continuing review and is reviewed by the IRB under procedures that meet FDA requirements for continuing review, FDA would not require an additional \"annual\" review.\n\n21 CFR 56.115(a)(1) requires that the IRB maintain copies of \"research proposals reviewed.\" Is the \"research proposal\" the same as the formal study protocol that the investigator receives from the sponsor of the research?\n\nYes. The IRB should receive and review all research activities [21 CFR 56.109(a)]. The documents reviewed should include the complete documents received from the clinical investigator, such as the protocol, the investigator's brochure, a sample consent document and any advertising intended to be seen or heard by prospective study subjects. Some IRBs also require the investigator to submit an institutionally-developed protocol summary form. A copy of all documentation reviewed is to be maintained for at least three years after completion of the research at that institution [21 CFR 56.115(b)]. However, when the IRB makes changes, such as in the wording of the informed consent document, only the finally approved copy needs to be retained in the IRB records.\n\n33. What IRB records are required for studies that are approved but never started?\n\nWhen an IRB approves a study, continuing review should be performed at least annually. All of the records listed in 21 CFR 56.115(a)(1) - (4) are required to be maintained. The clock starts on the date of approval, whether or not subjects have been enrolled. Written progress reports should be received from the clinical investigator for all studies that are in approved status prior to the date of expiration of IRB approval. If subjects were never enrolled, the clinical investigator's progress report would be brief. Such studies may receive continuing IRB review using expedited procedures. If the study is finally canceled without subject enrollment, records should be maintained for at least three years after cancellation [21 CFR 56.115(b)].\n\nV Informed Consent Process\n\nNo. The consent document is a written summary of the information that should be provided to the subject. Many clinical investigators use the consent document as a guide for the verbal explanation of the study. The subject's signature provides documentation of agreement to participate in a study, but is only one part of the consent process. The entire informed consent process involves giving a subject adequate information concerning the study, providing adequate opportunity for the subject to consider all options, responding to the subject's questions, ensuring that the subject has comprehended this information, obtaining the subject's voluntary agreement to participate and, continuing to provide information as the subject or situation requires. To be effective, the process should provide ample opportunity for the investigator and the subject to exchange information and ask questions.\n\n35. May informed consent be obtained by telephone from a legally authorized representative?\n\nA verbal approval does not satisfy the 21 CFR 56.109(c) requirement for a signed consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(a). However, it is acceptable to send the informed consent document to the legally authorized representative (LAR) by facsimile and conduct the consent interview by telephone when the LAR can read the consent as it is discussed. If the LAR agrees, he/she can sign the consent and return the signed document to the clinical investigator by facsimile.\n\n21 CFR 50.27(a) requires that a copy of the consent document be given to the person signing the form. Does this copy have to be a photocopy of the form with the subject's signature affixed?\n\nNo. The regulation does not require the copy of the form given to the subject to be a copy of the document with the subject's signature, although this is encouraged. It must, however, be a copy of the IRB approved document that was given to the subject to obtain consent [21 CFR 50.27(a) or 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)]. One purpose of providing the person signing the form with a copy of the consent document is to allow the subject to review the information with others, both before and after making a decision to participate in the study, as well as providing a continuing reference for items such as scheduling of procedures and emergency contacts.\n\nIf an IRB uses a standard \"fill-in-the-blank\" consent format, does the IRB need to review the filled out form for each study?\n\nYes. A fill-in-the-blank format provides only some standard wording and a framework for organizing the relevant study information. The IRB should review a completed sample form, individualized for each study, to ensure that the consent document, in its entirety, contains all the information required by 21 CFR 50.25 in language the subject can understand. The completed sample form should be typed to enhance its readability by the subjects. The form finally approved by the IRB should be an exact copy of the form that will be presented to the research subjects. The IRB should also review the \"process\" for conducting the consent interviews, i.e., the circumstances under which consent will be obtained, who will obtain consent, and so forth.\n\nThe informed consent regulations [21 CFR 50.25 (a)(5)] require the consent document to include a statement that notes the possibility that FDA may inspect the records. Is this statement a waiver of the subject's legal right to privacy? No. FDA does not require any subject to \"waive\" a legal right. Rather, FDA requires that subjects be informed that complete privacy does not apply in the context of research involving FDA regulated products. Under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA may inspect and copy clinical records to verify information submitted by a sponsor. FDA generally will not copy a subject's name during the inspection unless a more detailed study of the case is required or there is reason to believe that the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. The consent document should not state or imply that FDA needs clearance or permission from the clinical investigator, the subject or the IRB for such access. When clinical investigators conduct studies for submission to FDA, they agree to allow FDA access to the study records, as outlined in 21 CFR 312.68 and 812.145. Informed consent documents should make it clear that, by participating in research, the subject's records automatically become part of the research database. Subjects do not have the option to keep their records from being audited/reviewed by FDA. When an individually identifiable medical record (usually kept by the clinical investigator, not by the IRB) is copied and reviewed by the Agency, proper confidentiality procedures are followed within FDA. Consistent with laws relating to public disclosure of information and the law enforcement responsibilities of the Agency, however, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.\n\nWho should be present when the informed consent interview is conducted? FDA does not require a third person to witness the consent interview unless the subject or representative is not given the opportunity to read the consent document before it is signed, see 21 CFR 50.27(b). The person who conducts the consent interview should be knowledgeable about the study and able to answer questions. FDA does not specify who this individual should be. Some sponsors and some IRBs require the clinical investigator to personally conduct the consent interview. However, if someone other than the clinical investigator conducts the interview and obtains consent, this responsibility should be formally delegated by the clinical investigator and the person so delegated should have received appropriate training to perform this activity.\n\nHow do you obtain informed consent from someone who speaks and understands English but cannot read? Illiterate persons who understand English may have the consent read to them and \"make their mark,\" if appropriate under applicable state law. The 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) requirements for signature of a witness to the consent process and signature of the person conducting consent interview must be followed, if a \"short form\" is used. Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do.\n\nThe IRB should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to coercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated, see 21 CFR 56.111(b).\n\n41. Must a witness observe the entire consent interview or only the signature of the subject?\n\nFDA does not require the signature of a witness when the subject reads and is capable of understanding the consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(b)(1). The intended purpose is to have the witness present during the entire consent interview and to attest to the accuracy of the presentation and the apparent understanding of the subject. If the intent of the regulation were only to attest to the validity of the subject's signature, witnessing would also be required when the subject reads the consent.\n\n42.

The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Statutory Authority\n\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) (Title II of Public Law 108-282) amended the FD&C Act by defining the term \"major food allergen\" and stating that foods regulated under the FD&C Act are misbranded unless they declare the presence of each major food allergen on the product label using the common or usual name of that major food allergen. Section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) now defines a major food allergen as \"[m]ilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and soybeans\" and also as a food ingredient that contains protein derived from these foods. The definition excludes any highly refined oil derived from a major food allergen and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil.\n\nIn some cases, the production of an ingredient derived from a major food allergen may alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins in that derived ingredient to such an extent that it does not contain allergenic protein. In addition, a major food allergen may be used as an ingredient or as a component of an ingredient such that the level of allergenic protein in finished food products does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health. Therefore, FALCPA provides two mechanisms through which such ingredients may become exempt from the labeling requirement of section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. An ingredient may obtain an exemption through submission and approval of a petition containing scientific evidence that demonstrates that the ingredient \"does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health\" (section 403(w)(6) of the FD&C Act). This section also states that \"the burden shall be on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that such food ingredient, as derived by the method specified in the petition, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\" Alternately, an ingredient may become exempt through submission of a notification containing scientific evidence showing that the ingredient \"does not contain allergenic protein\" or that there has been a previous determination through a premarket approval process under section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient \"does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health\" (section 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act).\n\nTo evaluate these petitions and notifications, we will consider scientific evidence that describes:\n\nThe identity or composition of the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to produce the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to characterize the ingredient;\n\nThe intended use of the ingredient in food; and\n\nFor a petition, data and information, including the expected level of consumer exposure to the ingredient, that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured and used as described does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or 5b. For a notification, data and information that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured as described does not contain allergenic protein, or documentation of a previous determination under a process pursuant to section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\n\nWe will evaluate this scientific evidence only for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\nFDA recognizes that there are several methods that can be used to demonstrate that an ingredient meets the standards in 403(w)(6) and 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act. Each submitter may determine which approach is most appropriate for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\n3 Recommendations for Preparing Submissions\n\nDetermining Need for Submission\n\nThe following points should be considered in determining whether to submit a petition or notification:\n\nAn ingredient derived from a major food allergen that does not contain protein is not subject to the labeling requirements described in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. We are aware that there are some technologies (e.g., distillation) that may be able to produce protein-free ingredients because of the nature of the process and fundamental biochemical properties of proteins, peptides, and amino acids. When other technologies are used to produce an ingredient, information and expertise available to the manufacturer should make it possible to identify and apply the appropriate analytic methods to ensure that the ingredient does not contain protein. The methods used should be shown to be sufficiently accurate and sensitive under the conditions of use, including consideration of extraction efficiencies and possible interferences, should be scientifically appropriate, and sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate that no proteins or peptide fragments are present in the ingredient. Manufacturers should also consider potential batch to batch variation in the composition of the ingredient. Manufacturers may discuss methodological issues with us.\n\nA petition should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient derived from a major food allergen that may contain allergenic proteins, or derivatives of allergenic proteins such as peptide fragments, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health in food allergic individuals.\n\nA notification should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient that may contain proteins or protein fragments derived from a major food allergen does not contain allergenic protein.\n\nGeneral\n\nEach submission should contain information identifying the organization and individual primarily responsible for the submission. This should include the name of the individual and organization, a complete mailing address, a physical address if this differs from the mailing address, phone and fax numbers, and an electronic mail (email) address for the organization and for a primary contact. A joint submission from several organizations should include complete information for each organization.\n\nIngredient Description\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance document, ingredients include substances that are-\n\nDerived (e.g., through chemical, biochemical, mechanical, fermentation or bioengineering processes) from a major food allergen and that contain proteins or peptides\n\nA submission should provide a complete description of the ingredient including-\n\nBoth the common or usual name and any scientific name(s) of the ingredient;\n\nThe major food allergen source of the ingredient, if this is not obvious from the name, or the major food allergen sources used in the manufacture or engineering of the ingredient;\n\nThe chemical and biological properties or characteristics of the ingredient including molecular structure, sequence, etc., as appropriate;\n\nAny existing food standards of identity or specifications for the ingredient, such as from the FDA's food standards of identity regulations, Food Chemicals Codex, or Codex Alimentarius; and\n\nThe composition of the ingredient, including the methods used to determine composition, and batch-to-batch variation in composition should be described. If the ingredient contains more than one component, all components, including non-allergens, (including carriers or diluents), as well as the relative proportion of each in the ingredient should be described.\n\nIngredient Preparation or Manufacture\n\nThe method(s) or procedure(s) used to prepare or manufacture the ingredient should be described completely, particularly those steps that alter the amount, relative composition, or biochemical state of the proteins present. This description should include, for example-\n\nsuch as grinding, pressing, filtration;\n\nsuch as heating, cooking, baking, retorting;\n\nsuch as solvent extraction, hydrolysis (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic), cross-linking;\n\nsuch as the composition of the growth or nutrient media used in the manufacture of enzymes or organisms; and/or\n\nsuch as details of the construct, transformation event, and DNA and amino acid sequences.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing or preparation process should include-\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.886749029159546", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: How should I design my FSVP to provide assurances that a human food from a foreign supplier is not misbranded under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act with respect to labeling for the presence of major food allergens?\n\nA: As part of your FSVP, you should assure that the label of each human food you import complies with the labeling requirements for major food allergens. You should determine by audit, inspection, or other appropriate foreign supplier verification activity (see 21 CFR 1.506) whether the food contains a major food allergen that is not declared on the food label. Major food allergen means any of the following:\n\nMilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame. (For sesame, its addition to the definition of major food allergen applies to \"any food that is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce on or after January 1, 2023\" (Public Law 117-11)).\n\nA food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food specified in paragraph 1 above, except the following: 1. Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in paragraph 1 above and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil. 2. A food ingredient that is exempt under section 403(w)(6) and (7) of the FD&C Act (section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act).\n\nPackaged food for humans (except for RACs) that is, or contains an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen must meet the label and labeling requirements set forth in section 403(w) of the FD&C Act. Under section 403(w)(1), the food is misbranded (with respect to the labeling of food allergens) unless it meets one of the following criteria:\n\nThe word \"Contains,\" followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients (in a type size no smaller than the type size used in the list of ingredients) required under section 403(g) or (i); or\n\nThe common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients required under section 403(g) or (i) is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when: (1) the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived; or (2) the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived appears elsewhere in the ingredient list, unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of the food ingredient that is not a major food allergen.\n\nYou can find additional information on food allergen labeling in FDA's \"Guidance for Industry:\n\nQuestions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, including the Food Allergen Labeling and\n\nConsumer Protection Act of 2004 (Edition 4).\"\n\nThe requirement to provide assurances that a human food is not misbranded with respect to labeling for the presence of major food allergens under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act does not apply to food for animals. Therefore, if you are importing an animal food, you are not required verify that the animal food is not misbranded under section 403(w).\n\nQ: How should I design my FSVP to provide assurance that the foreign supplier did not adulterate a human food under section 402 of the FD&C Act due to cross-contact with a major food allergen?\n\nA: The presence of a major food allergen in a human food due to allergen cross-contact is a chemical hazard (21 CFR 117.130(b)(1)(ii)). Cross-contact can occur either between foods of different allergen profiles (e.g., foods that contain different food allergens or foods with and without food allergens). Introduction of an allergen through cross-contact may occur under various conditions, including during receiving, handling, processing and storage of ingredients and foods, utensils, and packaging; through improper handling and cleaning of equipment, utensils, and facilities; and through improper facility design. Your FSVP should be designed to determine by audit, inspection, or other appropriate foreign supplier verification activity whether your foreign supplier is controlling the potential for allergen cross-contact through processes and procedures such as:\n\nAppropriately scheduling the production of products so that there is no cross-contact between foods of different allergen profiles.\n\nAdequately cleaning between two different formulations of food of different allergen profiles.\n\nStoring allergen-containing ingredients separately from ingredients that do not contain the same allergen profile, especially where leakage of allergen-containing materials could lead to cross-contact.\n\nHandling powdered allergens in a way that prevents particles from blowing onto foods or food-contact surfaces for foods that have different allergen profiles.\n\n(See draft \"Food Hazards Guide\" (Chapter 3, 3.4.2.1.4 Undeclared food allergen hazards due to allergen cross-contact))\n\n2 Low-Acid Canned Food\n\nQ: How does the FSVP regulation apply to a low-acid canned food?\n\nA: For a thermally processed low-acid food packaged in a hermetically sealed container (low-acid canned food or LACF) that you import, you are not required to meet FSVP requirements for microbiological hazards that are controlled by 21 CFR part 113. That means, for example, that you are not required to address microbiological hazards that are controlled by 21 CFR part 113 in your hazard analysis. However, you must verify and document that your foreign supplier is producing the food in accordance with the LACF regulation in 21 CFR part 113 (see 21 CFR 1.502(b)(1)). The LACF regulation is designed to ensure control of microbiological hazards in an LACF.\n\nFor hazards in an LACF other than the microbiological hazards that are controlled by the low-acid canned food regulation (i.e., chemical and physical hazards), you must develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP in accordance with 21 CFR 1.502(a).\n\nIn addition, you are not required to comply with the FSVP requirements with respect to microbiological hazards in raw materials or other ingredients that you import and use in the manufacturing or processing of an LACF, provided that you comply with the LACF regulation for the food that you manufacture or process from the imported raw materials or other ingredients (21 CFR 1.502(b)(2)). With respect to other hazards in such raw materials or other ingredients, you must have an FSVP.\n\nAn appropriate verification activity to determine that your foreign supplier is producing an LACF in compliance with the LACF regulation may be that you conduct an onsite audit or review and assess the results of an onsite audit or inspection conducted by another entity. Alternatively, for each entry of an LACF, you might conclude that, instead of an onsite audit, it is appropriate to review the scheduled process and the processing and production records required under the LACF regulation and verify the integrity of the containers (e.g., cans are not swollen or leaking).\n\nChemical and physical hazards are not controlled under the LACF regulation. For chemical and physical hazards requiring a control, a verification activity (e.g., onsite audit or sampling and testing) would be required as part of your FSVP (see 21 CFR 1.506(d)). You may verify control of all hazards you identify as requiring a control, including non-microbiological hazards, during a single onsite audit or inspection of the LACF facility, instead of conducting separate activities to verify control of the non-microbiological hazards and compliance with the LACF regulation.\n\nFor more information on application of the FSVP regulation and other FSMA regulations to LACF and raw materials or other ingredients used in manufacturing or processing LACF, see FDA's guidance \"Low-Acid Foods Packaged in Hermetrically Sealed Containers (LACF) Regulation and the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.\"\n\n3 Importers That Also Are Receiving Facilities Under the Preventive Controls Regulations\n\nQ: What is a \"receiving facility\"?\n\nA: A receiving facility is a facility that is subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements and the supply-chain program requirements of 21 CFR part 117 or 507 and that manufactures/processes a raw material or other ingredient that it receives from a supplier(21 CFR 117.3 and 507.3). (A \"facility\" is a domestic facility or a foreign facility that is required to register under section 415 of the FD&C Act in accordance with the registration requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart H.)\n\nQ: Do I have to comply with all FSVP requirements if I am a receiving facility for a food I import?\n\nA: Although you must identify yourself as the FSVP importer at entry (21 CFR 1.509), you are deemed to be in compliance with the other FSVP requirements for a food you import if you are a receiving facility and you are in compliance with any of the following requirements with respect to the food:\n\nYou have implemented preventive controls for the hazards in the food in accordance with 21 CFR 117.135 or 507.34; or\n\nYou are not required to implement a preventive control under 21 CFR 117.136 or 507.36 with respect to the food; or\n\nYou are in compliance with the supply-chain program requirements of the preventive controls for human food regulation (21 CFR part 117, subpart G) or preventive controls for animal food regulation (21 CFR part 507, subpart E) (see 21 CFR 1.502(c)).\n\nFSVP requirements and examples for each of these categories of receiving facility are:\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.336117148399353", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix D Allergen Statement\n\nSection 403(w) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)) requires that major food allergens be identified on the label. Generally, major food allergens must be identified either in a statement beginning with the word \"Contains\" or by common or usual name of the allergen as part of the list of ingredients (section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)). Section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) defines \"major food allergen\" to include nine types of foods, including milk and soybeans, and also extends the definition of \"major food allergen\" (subject to exceptions) to food ingredients that contain protein derived from one of the nine types of foods (including milk and soybeans).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInfant formulas, like other foods, must also declare the name of the source of the major food allergen if a food ingredient contains protein derived from one of the nine foods, unless an exception applies (see section 201(qq)(2) of the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)(2)).11 Therefore, if your infant formula contains one of the major food allergens (e.g., milk or soybeans), then your food must identify the source of the ingredient either in the ingredient list or in a \"Contains\" statement. For example, if your infant formula contains enzymatically hydrolyzed whey protein isolate, then under section 403(w)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)(A)), you must either declare the source in the ingredient statement, i.e., \"enzymatically hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (milk),\" or in a Contains statement, i.e., \"Contains milk.\" Similarly, if your infant formula is a soybean-based formula or contains an ingredient with protein derived from soybeans, you must declare \"soybeans\" (\"soy\" and \"soya\" are reasonable synonyms) by one of the methods described above.\n\nFootnote 11: Under section 201(qq)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)(2)), the term \u201cmajor food allergen\u201d means a food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of nine foods\u2014milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame\u2014but it excepts \u201cany highly refined oil derived from [these nine foods] and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil,\u201d and a food ingredient that is exempt pursuant to the exemption processes at section 403(w)(6) or (w)(7) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or (w)(7)).\n\nDocument History\n\nFirst edition of guidance was issued.\n\nSecond edition.

Furthermore, all information appearing on the information panel must appear in one place without other intervening material (21 CFR 101.2(e)).\n\nThere are other FDA labeling provisions in addition to the requirements listed above. Under the labeling requirements of the FD&C Act, the food source name of any \"major food allergen\" present must be declared (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)). The FD&C Act defines \"major food allergen\" as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of them, with the exception of highly refined oils (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)).

Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) provides that labeling is misleading if, among other things, it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual. 21 U.S.C. SS 321(n). In a 1992 \"Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties\" (1992 Policy) (Ref. 5) FDA explained its interpretation of the FD&C Act with respect to foods derived from new plant varieties, including varieties developed using bioengineering. In the 1992 Policy, FDA stated that it was not aware of any information showing that bioengineered foods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding (Ref. 5). Further, FDA concluded that the method of development of a new plant variety (including the use of new techniques such as rDNA technology) is generally not material information within the meaning of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and would not usually be required to be disclosed in the labeling for the food. This determination was reviewed and upheld by the court in Alliance for Bio-Integrity v. Shalala, 116 F. Supp. 2d 166, 178-79 (D.D.C. 2000) (finding that FDA's determination that genetic engineering, alone, is not a material fact that warrants food labeling was entitled to deference) (Ref. 10). Labeling provided by manufacturers on a wholly voluntary basis regarding whether a food was or was not bioengineered as described in this guidance is acceptable to FDA, provided that such labeling is truthful and not misleading. Some consumers are interested in the information provided in such labeling.\n\nThe FD&C Act does not define the term \"material\" within the context of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act. Historically, the agency has interpreted the term, within the context of food, to mean information about the attributes of the food itself. For example, FDA has required special labeling in cases where the absence of such \"material\" information may: (1) pose special health risks (e.g., a warning statement on protein products used in very low calorie diets (21 CFR 101.17(d)) (Ref. 6), or a caution statement not to feed animal food products that contain animal-derived protein to cattle or other ruminants (21 CFR 589.2000(c)(1)(i)) (Ref. 7)); (2) mislead the consumer in light of other statements made on the labeling (e.g., a requirement for quantitative nutrient information when certain nutrient content claims are made about a product (21 CFR 101.13(j)) (Ref. 8)); or (3) in cases where a consumer may assume that a food, because of its similarity to another food, has nutritional, organoleptic (e.g., taste, smell, or texture), or functional characteristics of the food it resembles when in fact it does not (e.g., a statement that reduced fat margarine is not suitable for frying (21 CFR 101.13(d)(1)) (Ref. 9). Further, section 403(i) of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations require that each food bear a common or usual name or, in the absence of such a name, an appropriately descriptive term (21 U.S.C. SS 343(i); 21 CFR 101.3, 501.3). For example, if oil from a genetically engineered canola plant has a significantly different amount of lauric acid such that the fatty acid composition of the oil is significantly changed compared to traditional canola oil, the term \"canola oil\" no longer adequately identifies or describes the nature of the oil or its characterizing properties, particularly Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nsince oils are distinguished by their fatty acid profiles.\n\nSince the commercial introduction of bioengineered crops in the United States in 1996, the use of bioengineered crops has accelerated and such crops are now widely used (Ref. 11). In 2013, in the United States, bioengineered soybeans made up 93 percent of the acreage of planted soybeans, bioengineered cotton made up 90 percent of the acreage of planted cotton, and bioengineered corn varieties made up 90 percent of the acreage planted corn (Ref. 11). In addition, bioengineered sugar beets accounted for 95 percent of the acreage of planted sugar beets in the 2009-2010 crop year (Ref. 11).\n\nIII Guidance\n\nGeneral principles\n\nIn determining whether a food is misbranded, FDA generally reviews labeling statements under sections 403 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and if applicable, other sections of the FD&C Act. Under section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, a food is misbranded if its label or labeling is false or misleading in any particular. For example, the label on a chocolate bar may not declare that the chocolate contains ingredients, such as walnuts and coconut oil, if those ingredients are not actually present in the chocolate.\n\nUnder section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, both the presence and the absence of information are relevant to whether labeling is misleading. Put another way, food labeling may be misleading if it makes or suggests certain representations, or if it fails to disclose facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested about a food or facts that are material with respect to the consequences that may result from use of the food. In determining whether a labeling statement about a food is misleading under sections 201(n) and 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA takes into account all labeling for that food, including the label on the food itself (e.g., all words used on the label including the brand name of the product, vignettes, logos or any of its containers or wrappers and other information accompanying the food, such as labeling for the food that is on the internet. Labeling means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article. 21 U.S.C. 321(m) (section 201(m) of the FD&C Act). Firms should be aware that \"labeling\" may extend to information beyond that included on containers or wrappers. For example, in certain circumstances, information that is disseminated over the internet by, or on behalf of, a regulated company meets the definition of labeling in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act and is subject to applicable requirements. See, e.g., Guidance for Industry and FDA: Dear Manufacturer letter Regarding Food Labeling, January 2007, available at:\n\nhttp://wwwfdagov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Labe\n\nlingNutrition/ucm053425.htm. These general principles apply in evaluating a food labeling claim, including a statement about whether a food is or is not developed using modern plant biotechnology.\n\nB Statements about foods that are not derived from genetically engineered plants\n\nFood manufacturers may voluntarily label their foods with information about whether the foods were not produced using bioengineering, as long as such information is truthful and not misleading. In general, an accurate statement about whether a food was not produced using bioengineering is one that provides information in a context that clearly refers to bioengineering technology. Examples of such statements include:\n\n\"Not bioengineered.\"\n\n\"Not genetically engineered.\"\n\n\"Not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology.\"\n\n\"We do not use ingredients that were produced using modern biotechnology.\"\n\n\"This oil is made from soybeans that were not genetically engineered.\"\n\n\"Our corn growers do not plant bioengineered seeds.\"\n\nOther terms are sometimes used by manufacturers in food labeling regarding whether a food was not derived from genetically engineered plants, including \"not genetically modified\" and claims using the acronym \"GMO\" (genetically modified organism). For the reasons discussed in the remaining paragraphs of this section, FDA recommends terms such as \"not bioengineered,\" \"not genetically engineered,\" and \"not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology.\" However, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym \"GMO\" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was not produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the food is, in fact, not derived from a genetically engineered plant and the food's labeling is not otherwise false or misleading, as further discussed in this guidance. Similarly, we do not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym \"GMO\" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the statement was true and the food's labeling is not otherwise false or misleading.\n\nAs stated, FDA encourages manufacturers to use labeling claims that state that a food product (or its ingredients, as appropriate) was not developed using bioengineering, genetic engineering, or modern biotechnology such as the claims included above.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Plants \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6410625576972961", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: We intend to apply that policy in this circumstance. Accordingly, in anticipation of farms seeking to comply with the provision in the Produce Safety Rule that qualified exempt status requires that a farm's direct sales to qualified end-users must exceed its food sales to all other buyers, FDA will essentially restart the clock on the three years that get averaged for the criterion related to direct sales to qualified end-users. That means that farms that have not been selling directly to qualified end-users during the PHE may begin counting anew to reach three years of direct sales to average.\n\nFDA will consider the first calendar year after expiration of the PHE to be Year 1. Specifically, since the PHE is expected to expire on May 11, 2023, Year 1 would begin January 1, 2024. During 2024, farms that had been following the recommendations described in the COVID Qualified Exemption guidance to determine eligibility for qualified exempt status (regarding sales to qualified end-users) may continue to do so, but such farms also should begin collecting data on the monetary value of food the farm sold directly to qualified end-users (as well as the monetary value of food the farm sold to all other buyers).\n\n2025 would be Year 2. In 2025, farms that had been following the recommendations described in the COVID Qualified Exemption guidance to determine eligibility for qualified exempt status may satisfy the criterion regarding direct sales to qualified end-users if the monetary value of food the farm sold directly to qualified end-users in 2024 exceeded the average monetary value of food the farm sold to all other buyers in 2024. Stated differently, in 2025, no averaging is necessary to satisfy the criterion regarding direct sales to qualified end-users; the farm may simply consider its sales from 2024 to determine whether the qualified end-user criterion is satisfied.\n\n2026 would be Year 3. In 2026, farms that had been following the recommendations described in the COVID Qualified Exemption guidance to determine eligibility for qualified exempt status may establish sufficient sales to qualified end-users if the average monetary value of direct food sales to qualified end-users in 2024 and 2025 exceeded the average monetary value of food the farm sold to all other buyers in 2024 and 2025. If the qualified end-user criterion is not satisfied, then the farm would no longer have qualified exempt status and, unless another exemption applies, would be expected to comply with the full requirements of the Produce Safety Rule.\n\nIn 2027, farms should have all the data needed to determine if the criterion regarding direct sales to qualified end-users has been met; they should be able to calculate a three-year average using sales data from 2024-2026. Stated differently, farms that had been following the recommendations described in the COVID Qualified Exemption guidance to determine eligibility for qualified exempt status may establish sufficient sales to qualified end-users if the average monetary value of direct food sales to qualified end-users in 2024-2026 exceeded the average monetary value of food the farm sold to all other buyers in 2024-2026.\n\nThis process of phasing back in FDA's expectations regarding compliance with the qualified end-user criterion does not impact the total food sales criterion. For the duration of the PHE, qualified exempt status has been reserved for farms for which the average annual monetary value of all food sold during the preceding three-year period was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation. During the transition period described in this guidance, the annual monetary value of all food sold by the farm must continue to be averaged over the preceding three-year period (21 CFR 112.5(a)(2)).\n\nA farm that began operations during the PHE is covered by the qualified end-user transition policy and thus may be eligible for qualified exempt status in accordance with this guidance. That is, such a farm may establish sufficient sales to qualified end-users if the monetary value of food the farm sold directly to qualified end-users in 2024 exceeded the average monetary value of food the farm sold to all other buyers in 2024, and so on. In terms of the total food sales criterion, the farm would use its sales data based on the records it has; that is, the farm would consider just the year(s) in which it has been in operation.\n\nWe recognize that, for some farms, market channels were not as seriously disrupted during the period in which the COVID Qualified Exemption guidance was in effect. Some farms have sold more directly to qualified end-users than all other buyers throughout the pandemic period and have retained the relevant documentation. Other farms may have been able to regain sufficient direct sales to qualified end-users and, therefore, start transitioning away from the COVIDQualified Exemption guidance earlier than the expiration of the PHE. Farms that became able to meet the qualified end-user criterion for qualified exempt status, and that collected relevant data during the time that the COVID Qualified Exemption guidance was in effect, may voluntarily consider that data in their calculations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Transition from Temporary Policy During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Regarding the Qualified Exemption from the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.30941915512085"], "After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor's obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency's view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject's decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB's primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor's need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n\"A sponsor's preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval.\" The effect of the IRB's NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor's wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency's policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.6348392963409424", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Although FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) \"GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline\" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as \"a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\"17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject's legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is \"a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection.\" We consider an IEC to be \"adequately constituted\" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC's functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered \"adequately constituted\" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as \"a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.\"19 Informed consent is \"documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.\"20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC's written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., \"Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z\"); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., \"Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z\").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA's review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor's/applicant's compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission's cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor's compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (\"List and Description of Investigators\") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 \"Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports\"23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.3137001991271973", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator's responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution's IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution's IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be \"men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.\"1 In addition, IRB members must \"be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice\" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution's own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution's own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution's IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution's IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution's IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution's IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution's IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution's IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.299260139465332", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: What if the sponsor changes during the course of the study or within one year of completion of the study, for example, through purchase or merger?\n\nA:: Agency regulations require that an IND/IDE sponsor collect financial information from all clinical investigators and that clinical investigators promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Therefore, if the study spons changes during the course of the study, the clinical investigators will need to update their financial disclosure information relevant to the new sponsor. The new sponsor is responsible for collecting this information, and to ensure that the new sponsor has complete financial disclosure information, the new sponsor should seek this information from the original sponsor, and the agency encourages the original sponsor to share their records with the new sponsor.\n\nWith respect to covered clinical studies conducted outside the United States not pursuant to an IND or IDE (such as studies submitted pursuant to SS 312.120 or SS 814.15), the agency expects applicants to take affirmative action, at the earliest opportunity, to see that this information is collected and available to make a complete disclosure and/or certification under part 54.\n\nAppendix D Clinical Investigator\n\n0.1 Q: Who is included in the definition of \"clinical investigator\"?\n\nUnder part 54, \"clinical investigator means only a listed or identified investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects\" (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). This definition is intended to identify the individuals for whom reporting under this regulation is required. Generally, these individuals are considered to be the investigators and subinvestigators taking responsibility for the study at a given study site. The definition also includes the spouse and each dependent child of such an investigator or subinvestigator. It should be noted that hospital staff, including nurses, residents, fellows, and office staff who provide ancillary or intermittent care but who do not make direct and significant contribution to the data are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator. Additionally, individuals who only collect specimens or perform routine tests (such as blood pressure, EKG, x-ray) are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator for purposes of financial disclosure.\n\n2 Q: How does the definition of \"clinical investigator\" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND regulations (21 CFR part 312)?\n\nFor drugs and biological products, an investigator under 21 CFR part 312 is defined as \"an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. 'Subinvestigator' includes any other individual member of that team.\" (21 CFR SS 312.3(b).) For purposes of the financial disclosure regulation, a clinical investigator is an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). Therefore, the term clinical investigator in this context would generally include anyone who fits any of the following criteria: signs the FORM FDA 1572 (Statement of Investigator), is identified as an investigator in initial submissions or protocol amendments under an IND, or is identified as an investigator in the marketing application. This could include individuals identified as subinvestigatorson a FORM FDA 1572.14 For studies not conducted under an IND, the sponsor will need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455 as appropriate. FDA expects that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site. If other individuals are responsible for a study at a site, those persons should also be included as clinical investigators. Footnote 14: For guidance on who should be listed as an investigator or subinvestigator on Form FDA 1572, please see FDA\u2019s Information Sheet Guidance, \u201cFrequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572)\u201d available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nQ: How does the definition of \"clinical investigator\" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the medical device regulations (21 CFR part 812)?\n\nFor medical devices, investigator is defined under 21 CFR part 812 as an individual under whose immediate direction the subject is treated and the investigational device is administered, including follow-up evaluations and treatments. Where an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. (21 CFR SS 812.3(i).)\n\nIn general, investigators and subinvestigators sign \"investigator agreements\" in accordance with 21 CFR SS 812.43(c), and it is these individuals whose financial interests and arrangements should be reported as they would fall under the definition at 21 CFR SS 54.2(d). For studies not conducted under an FDA-approved IDE (that is, a non-significant risk IDE or an exempt study), the sponsor would need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455, as appropriate. We expect that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site.\n\nQ: Is it necessary to collect financial information on spouses and dependent children of clinical investigators?\n\nYes. The definition of clinical investigator in 21 CFR part 54 includes the spouse and dependent children of the investigators and subinvestigators who are required to report. Therefore, the financial interests and arrangements of the spouse and each dependent child of each investigator and subinvestigator are to be included in the disclosure (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). The dollar amount that triggers reporting is the total of the financial interests of the investigator, spouse, and dependent children (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). If a spouse or dependent child is an employee of the sponsor, the clinical investigator should be identified as an employee of the sponsor and no further disclosure is required. (See 21 CFR SS 54.4.)\n\nQ: Who is considered a \"dependent child\"?\n\nFor purposes of clinical investigator financial disclosure under part 54, a dependent child is the investigator's child (whether by blood or adoption), stepchild or foster child who is unmarried, and for whom the investigator provides more than one-half of the child's support. This would include a child who, at any time during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study, is under the age of 19, under the age of 24 if a full-time student, or who is permanently and totally disabled. Such a child would generally have the same principal residence as the investigator.\n\n*Q: What obligations does the clinical investigator have under the financial disclosure regulations?\n\nClinical investigators are to provide sponsors sufficient accurate financial information to allow the applicant to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Clinical investigators must provide this information to sponsors and also promptly update the information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following the completion of the study (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4(b), 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). See also Question C.2.\n\n*Q: May a clinical investigator rely on the information he/she provided to comply with his/her institution's policies and procedures pertaining to financial conflicts of interest to comply with the investigator obligations for financial disclosure under FDA's regulations?\n\nThe financial information a clinical investigator provides to his/her institution is based on the institution's requirements, which may not be sufficient to meet FDA's regulations. FDA's regulations require the clinical investigator to provide sufficient and accurate financial information to the sponsor to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements under FDA's clinical investigator financial disclosure regulations (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)). However, if an investigator determines that the financial information he/she provided to his/her institution adequately fulfills the disclosure requirements in FDA's regulations, a clinical investigator could provide the same information to the sponsor. The clinical investigator would still need to commit to promptly updating the financial information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)).\n\n*Q: How does the definition of \"sponsor\" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND/IDE regulations (21 CFR parts 312 and 812)?\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.0411220788955688", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nRecruiting Study Subjects\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nFDA requires that an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and have authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove all research activities covered by the IRB regulations [21 CFR 56.109(a)]. An IRB is required to ensure that appropriate safeguards exist to protect the rights and welfare of research subjects [21 CFR 56.107(a) and 56.111]. In fulfilling these responsibilities, an IRB is expected to review all the research documents and activities that bear directly on the rights and welfare of the subjects of proposed research. The protocol, the consent document and, for studies conducted under the Investigational New Drug (IND) regulations, the investigator's brochure are examples of documents that the IRB should review. The IRB should also review the methods and material that investigators propose to use to recruit subjects.\n\nMedia Advertising:\n\nDirect advertising for research subjects, i.e., advertising that is intended to be seen or heard by prospective subjects to solicit their participation in a study, is not in and of itself, an objectionable practice. Direct advertising includes, but is not necessarily limited to: newspaper, radio, TV, bulletin boards, posters, and flyers that are intended for prospective subjects. Not included are: (1) communications intended to be seen or heard by health professionals, such as \"dear doctor\" letters and doctor-to-doctor letters (even when soliciting for study subjects), (2) news stories and (3) publicity intended for other audiences, such as financial page advertisements directed toward prospective investors.\n\nIRB review and approval of listings of clinical trials on the internet would provide no additional safeguard and is not required when the system format limits the information provided to basic trial information, such as: the title; purpose of the study; protocol summary; basic eligibility criteria; study site location(s); and how to contact the site for further information. Examples of clinical trial listing services that do not require prospective IRB approval include the National Cancer Institute's cancer clinical triallisting (PDQ) and the government-sponsored AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service (ACTIS). However, when the opportunity to add additional descriptive information is not precluded by the data base system, IRB review and approval may assure that the additional information does not promise or imply a certainty of cure or other benefit beyond what is contained in the protocol and the informed consent document. FDA considers direct advertising for study subjects to be the start of the informed consent and subject selection process. Advertisements should be reviewed and approved by the IRB as part of the package for initial review. However, when the clinical investigator decides at a later date to advertise for subjects, the advertising may be considered an amendment to the ongoing study. When such advertisements are easily compared to the approved consent document, the IRB chair, or other designated IRB member, may review and approve by expedited means, as provided by 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2). When the IRB reviewer has doubts or other complicating issues are involved, the advertising should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB. FDA expects IRBs to review the advertising to assure that it is not unduly coercive and does not promise a certainty of cure beyond what is outlined in the consent and the protocol. This is especially critical when a study may involve subjects who are likely to be vulnerable to undue influence. [21 CFR 50.20, 50.25, 56.111(a)(3), 56.111(b) and 812.20(b)(11).] When direct advertising is to be used, the IRB should review the information contained in the advertisement and the mode of its communication, to determine that the procedure for recruiting subjects is not coercive and does not state or imply a certainty of favorable outcome or other benefits beyond what is outlined in the consent document and the protocol. The IRB should review the final copy of printed advertisements to evaluate the relative size of type used and other visual effects. When advertisements are to be taped for broadcast, the IRB should review the final audio/video tape. The IRB may review and approve the wording of the advertisement prior to taping to preclude re-taping because of inappropriate wording. The review of the final taped message prepared from IRB-approved text may be accomplished through expedited procedures. The IRB may wish to caution the clinical investigators to obtain IRB approval of message text prior to taping, in order to avoid re-taping because of inappropriate wording. No claims should be made, either explicitly or implicitly, that the drug, biologic or device is safe or effective for the purposes under investigation, or that the test article is known to be equivalent or superior to any other drug, biologic or device. Such representation would not only be misleading to subjects but would also be a violation of the Agency's regulations concerning the promotion of investigational drugs [21 CFR 312.7(a)] and of investigational devices [21 CFR 812.7(d)]. Advertising for recruitment into investigational drug, biologic or device studies should not use terms such as \"new treatment,\" \"new medication\" or \"new drug\" without explaining that the test article is investigational. A phrase such as \"receive new treatments\" leads study subjects to believe they will be receiving newly improved products of proven worth.\n\nAdvertisements should not promise \"free medical treatment,\" when the intent is only to say subjects will not be charged for taking part in the investigation. Advertisements may state that subjects will be paid, but should not emphasize the payment or the amount to be paid, by such means as larger or bold type.\n\nGenerally, FDA believes that any advertisement to recruit subjects should be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their eligibility and interest. When appropriately worded, the following items may be included in advertisements. It should be noted, however, that FDA does not require inclusion of all of the listed items.\n\nthe name and address of the clinical investigator and/or research facility;\n\nthe condition under study and/or the purpose of the research;\n\nin summary form, the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility for the study;\n\na brief list of participation benefits, if any (e.g., a no-cost health examination);\n\nthe time or other commitment required of the subjects; and\n\nthe location of the research and the person or office to contact for further information.\n\nReceptionist Scripts\n\nThe first contact prospective study subjects make is often with a receptionist who follows a script to determine basic eligibility for the specific study. The IRB should assure the procedures followed adequately protect the rights and welfare of the prospective subjects. In some cases personal and sensitive information is gathered about the individual. The IRB should have assurance that the information will be appropriately handled. A simple statement such as \"confidentiality will be maintained\" does not adequately inform the IRB of the procedures that will be used.\n\nExamples of issues that are appropriate for IRB review: What happens to personal information if the caller ends the interview or simply hangs up? Are the data gathered by a marketing company? If so, are names, etc. sold to others? Are names of non-eligibles maintained in case they would qualify for another study? Are paper copies of records shredded or are readable copies put out as trash? The acceptability of the procedures would depend on the sensitivity of the data gathered, including; personal, medical and financial.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Petitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative 23.8.20.5.503\n\nrecord submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Recruiting Study Subjects Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.19716109335422516", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nNon-local IRB Review\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/non-local-irb-review).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nUnder certain circumstances, local review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may not be available, e.g., research conducted by investigators unaffiliated with an institution with an IRB. Although conceptually modeled for local IRB review, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations do not prohibit review of research by IRBs in locations other than where the research is to be performed (e.g., independent or non-institutional IRB). Therefore, an IRB may review studies that are not performed on-site as long as the 21 CFR parts 50 and 56 requirements are met.\n\nWhen non-local IRB review takes place, the reviewing IRB must document its role and responsibility. A written agreement should be executed between the performance site where the research is to be conducted (e.g., private practitioner's office, clinic, etc.) and the IRB or its institution. The agreement should confirm the authority of the IRB to oversee the study. While the IRB assumes responsibility for oversight and continuing review, the clinical investigator and the research site retain the responsibility for the conduct of the study.\n\nCommunity Attitudes\n\nThe non-local IRB should have adequate knowledge of community attitudes, information on conditions surrounding the conduct of the research, and the continuing status of the research to assure fulfilling the requirements of 21 CFR 56.107, 56.111(a)(3), (a)(7) and (b) for each study site. The non-local IRB needs to ensure these requirements are met for each location for which it has assumed IRB oversight responsibility.\n\nThe FDA regulations require all IRBs to have membership sufficiently qualified to promote respect for the IRB's advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects [21 CFR 56.107]. IRBs conducting non-local review need to be knowledgeable about the community from which the subjects are drawn to ensure that subject rights will be protected and that the consent process is appropriate for the subject population involved. The Top 0IRB should be sensitive to community laws and moves because state and local laws and community attitudes pertaining to research may be more restrictive than Federal regulations or the prevailing standards of the community where the IRB is located.\n\nIRBs can obtain knowledge of community attitudes with a site visit by a representative of the IRB, by appointing an IRB member from that community, or by having a consultant from the community advise the IRB, either prior to or during the deliberations. If travel is not feasible, participation in the IRB meeting can be by video-conference or conference telephone call, or by using other technologies that allow for real-time conversational interaction between the remote member and the members at the convened location. All IRB members should receive an advance copy of the documents that are to be reviewed at the meeting. The minutes of the meeting, during which non-local research is reviewed, should document the procedures used to assure that community attitudes were adequately taken into consideration.\n\nIRB Information Needs\n\nIRBs should have access to a variety of information to properly conduct initial and continuing reviews. Knowledge of the conditions surrounding the conduct of the research is needed to ensure that risks to subjects are minimized [21 CFR 56.111]. An IRB should have sufficient information to judge the qualifications of the researcher conducting the study in question. The researcher's curriculum vitae, a listing of other studies conducted, letters of reference, information from the sponsor of the research, and information from licensing boards and professional societies are examples of information a non-local IRB may want to review. If the research is to be conducted in an institution, the clinical investigator should provide a description of that institution and associated medical facilities. The acknowledgment and/or the permission of the institution should also be provided. If the research is to be conducted outside an institutional setting, the IRB may request a plan for emergency medical care. Depending upon the degree of risk inherent in the study, a hospital should certify that its facilities are available.\n\nThe IRB should explicitly detail the information it needs in written reports from the researcher. In addition to scheduled continuing review of progress reports, an IRB may use other methods of obtaining information on the conduct of the study. All IRBs should have procedures that assure the IRB becomes aware of unexpected problems in ongoing studies in a timely manner. Fulfilling this requirement may call for additional efforts for non-local IRBs, such as visiting the study site, contacting the sponsor's research monitor for information on the monitor's site visits, or arranging for other oversight of the study.\n\nIRB Contact\n\nThe FDA informed consent regulations [21 CFR 50.25(a)(7)] require that the subject be given the name of a person to contact \"... for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject.\" Non-local IRBs should include, in the consent document, an IRB contact person and a telephone number (toll-free if long-distance). The non-local IRB may also designate an (\\mathsf{top}\\,0) individual at the research site to be the contact and to relay reports to the IRB.\n\n23.8.20. 5.7.502.\n\nIRB Jurisdiction\n\nWhen an institution has a local IRB, the written procedures of that IRB or of the institution should define the scope of studies subject to review by that IRB. A non-local IRB may not become the IRB of record for studies within that defined scope unless the local IRB or the administration of the institution agree. Any agreement to allow review by a non-local IRB should be in writing.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheet: \"Cooperative Research.\" (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/cooperative-research).\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Petitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Non-local IRB Review Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2664235234260559"], "Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nDrug Stability Guidelines\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe guideline is to be used as an aid in designing and conducting studies to establish drug stability in support of original, abbreviated or supplements to new animal drug applications (NADAs/ANADAs). The guideline will provide a framework within which stability studies can be conducted to provide meaningful and sufficient data. The concept of the guidelines is applicable to studies on drug substances and the actual dosage form. The guideline is not intended to restrict experimentation. The guideline applies to pharmaceutical dosage forms and medicated feed products.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA's guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval. 21 CFR 514.1 specifies the proper form and the information required to be submitted. Included is a requirement under section 514.1(b)(5)(x) that an applicant submit data from stability studies completed as well as information about studies that are underway to substantiate the request for a specific expiration date and provide information on the stability of the drug products.\n\nCGMP regulations under 21 CFR Part 200 also require stability testing for pharmaceutical dosage forms (21 CFR 211) and Type A Medicated Articles (medicated premixes) (21 CFR 226). This guideline can be used as an aid to conduct the required stability testing.\n\nThe agency advises that this final guideline represents its current position on the development of stability studies to meet the requirements of the submission of original or abbreviated newanimal drug applications and the corresponding CGMP regulations. The guideline may be useful to manufacturers of new animal drug products. A person may follow the guideline or may choose to use alternate procedures even though they are not provided for in the guideline. If a person chooses to use alternate procedures, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable by FDA. This guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person.\n\n2 General Considerations\n\nProtocols\n\nPrior to the submission of an original or supplemental NADA, an applicant may wish to submit a stability protocol for comment before committing to studies that will become a permanent part of the NADA.\n\nThe protocol should contain an outline of the proposed plan to be used in generating stability data. The protocol should describe the type of product being tested, sampling process, duration and frequency of testing, number of samples and replicates per time interval, storage conditions (length of storage, type of storage, temperatures and packaging), methods of analysis (description or reference of published methods) with accompanying support data, if available, and other tests. The information listed in these guidelines should be incorporated as appropriate in the development of a plan.\n\nThe Center's review scientists will evaluate and comment on the proposed protocols or assist an applicant (upon request) in the design of a study.\n\nIt should be noted that the Center for Veterinary Medicine does not approve protocols.\n\nApplicants or drug firms proposing to conduct stability studies should refer to the following texts:\n\n\"Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals\" by K. Connors, G. Amidon and L. Kennon, John Wiley & Sons (1979). and\n\n\"Formulation of Veterinary Dosage Forms\", vol. 17, Drugs and The Pharmaceutical Sciences, Blodinger, J., Marcel Dekker Inc., NY. (1983). Chapter 5.\n\nThese texts provide information on the various aspects of establishing a stability program.\n\nGeneral Stability Considerations\n\nDefinition of Active IngrediThe active ingredient of an animal drug preparation is defined as that chemical whose biological, physiological, pharmacological, or chemical activities are claimed on the label to be beneficial for animals in normal or pathological conditions (diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, prophylaxis, therapy) or for animal production.\n\nStrength (Potency) The strength of a drug substance may be its concentration (quantity of the drug per unit measure), its potency, or both. The potency of a drug is a measurable (quantitative) extent of the biological, physiological, pharmacological, or chemical activities of the drug per unit weight or volume of the drug preparation. Drug preparations are considered stable if the active ingredient can maintain its strength at the level specified on the label for the maximum anticipated shelf-life (the time period from the date of manufacture until administration to the animal) under environmental conditions likely to be encountered in actual use. However, few, if any, drug preparations maintain their full label-claimed strength under specified conditions. Therefore, allowances are made for some unavoidable deviations from drug levels declared on the label by designating specific limits for tolerable deviations. A drug product is considered unstable when the drug substance (active ingredient) loses sufficient potency to adversely affect the safety or efficacy of the drug or falls outside labeled specifications as shown by stability-indicating methods. To properly evaluate the stability of a drug product, it is essential to determine the storage conditions under which the drug strength can be maintained in order to provide a safe and efficacious drug product. As a guide in determining drug strength in pharmaceutical dosage forms, the following is recognized by the scientific community: * \"Although there are exceptions, 90% of the labeled potency is generally recognized as the minimum acceptable potency level.\"1\n\nDrug Preparation The active ingredient should be formulated in any drug preparation at 100% of label claim. An overage of the active ingredient may be permitted in a product should the need exist. All overages should be justified. The assay limits must account for the overage. The overage should not exceed the limits of 5% for antibiotics and 3% for nonantibiotic chemicals as established by the Center for Veterinary Medicine.\n\nChemical and Physical Properties Strength is not the only criterion of drug product stability. Maintenance of various chemical and physical properties to preserve the effectiveness and safety of the drug is also important. Properties, such as physical appearance, crystalline form, particle size, solubility, disintegration rate, pH, sterility, viscosity, palatability (taste and odor), may be stability related and thus require testing and the setting of specific storage conditions and limits. In addition, tests may also be needed to determine the absence or presence of harmful degradation products.\n\nAdded Substances Stability data on substances that are added to a drug preparation to enhance its stability, usefulness, physical or chemical properties or as an aid in manufacturing may be required. The type of substance(s) used, its purpose, and its relationship to the active drug ingredient(s) and total drug preparation will determine if testing for the substance is required. Examples of added substances that may commonly be used are antioxidants, antibacterials, absorbants (bentonite), etc.\n\nProduct Changes Changes made in the composition (formulation) or dosage form of the original or succeeding product(s) present a new drug product and will require generation of new stability data. Data requirements will depend on the nature and degree of change. Any change requires an evaluation as to the effect on the stability of the products.\n\nCorrelation with Efficacy and Toxicity Studies Stability studies supporting an application should be performed on the drug preparation in its final formulation whose efficacy and safety has been demonstrated. Any change made in an approved preparation requires consideration of the effects on the efficacy and safety of the \"changed\" drug product.\n\nDegradation Products\n\nDegradation products that occur during storage (under shelf-life testing) should be identified. These products should be thoroughly investigated and evaluated for safety and toxicology purposes. The presence of degradation products may require additional safety and efficacy studies.\n\nProduct Stability Parameters\n\nThe established regulatory registration (NADA or NDA) specifications or Compendial standards are to be used for determining the stability of the products. There can be only one set of standards. Samples of products (from production lots) on stability should be representative of those in the market place. Expiration dating is based on the ability of the product to be measured over a certain period of time against the established specifications or standards.\n\nAppendix C Storage Conditions\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #5 Drug Stability Guidelines \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7049208879470825", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA will RTR an ANDA if both worst-case scenario and non-worst-case stability data adhering to the recommendations described in section V.2.1 and this section are not submitted for the described drug product batches: liquids, solutions, semi-solids, and suspensions.55\n\nFootnote 55: See 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)(i) stating that ANDAs must include chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information required under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix C Packaging Amount Considerations\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA does not package a minimum (threshold) amount of the finished drug product in the container/closure systems that are proposed for marketing, as discussed in FDA's guidance for industry ANDAs: Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers.56 Also as discussed in the guidance, the threshold amount that should be packaged is governed by the specific dosage form (e.g., solid oral dosage forms, oral powders/solutions/suspensions, parenteral drug products, ophthalmic/otic drug products, transdermal patches, and topicals such as creams/lotions/gels and inhalation solutions/nasal sprays) of the finished drug product that is the subject of the ANDA submission.\n\nFootnote 56: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\n\nTo qualify the dosage units that are packaged toward the applicable threshold, the following three recommended criteria for each container/closure configuration should be satisfied:\n\nStability data (as described in section V.2.1 of this guidance).\n\nContainer/closure system information should be submitted in ANDA section 3.2.P.7. If bracketing or matrixing is used, an ANDA should include the container/closure system information applicable to configurations that were excluded from stability studies because of bracketing or matrixing.\n\nContainer and carton (if applicable) labeling for each packaging configuration containing dosage units to be counted in the overall packaged total should be provided in section 1.14.1 of the ANDA.\n\nAppendix D Batch Records\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if blank and executed batch records are not provided, regardless of whether commercial scale-up is proposed.57 For example, both commercial (blank) and executed (pilot) batch records for the pilot batches that are manufactured to support an ANDA should be submitted, along with any accompanying reconciliation sheets.\n\nFootnote 57: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if method validation/verification reports are not provided.58 It is critical that method validation/verification reports for all analytical methods be provided in sections 3.2.S.4.3 and 3.2.P.5.3 of the ANDA, for both the drug substance (API) and drug product, respectively. That is, for drug products for which a relevant official United States Pharmacopeia (USP) drug product monograph exists, verification59 of the USP analytical procedures should be provided. Verification should also be submitted for methods used from outside sources, such as a Type II API DMF holder, unless the methods have been fully validated in house. For any in-house methods used, validation of the analytical procedure should be submitted in either of the appropriate sections of the ANDA (i.e., sections 3.2.S.4.3 or 3.2.P.5.3). In-house methods used in lieu of USP methods should be compared to the USP method to support a demonstration that the in-house method is sufficient.\n\nFootnote 58: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1) and 314.94(a)(9)(i).\n\nFootnote 59: 25 EP (European Pharmacopoeia)/BP (British Pharmacopoeia)/JP (Japanese Pharmacopoeia) methods may be allowed, for which, in many cases, verification (versus full validation) may suffice.\n\nFootnote 60: On May 5, 2017, the electronic submission of ANDAs in a format specified by FDA will be required. See discussion in section III.B.\n\nIn addition, for ANDAs not submitted electronically60, the applicant should submit three copies of the method validation/verification package for the API, the drug product, or both.61\n\nFootnote 61: 21 CFR 314.50(e)(2)(i).\n\nFootnote 63: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix F Special Consideration for Transdermal Patches\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA for a transdermal patch if the ANDA does not address certain special considerations.62,63\n\nFootnote 63: In addition to the considerations identified in this section, FDA has provided recommendations on the submission of studies evaluating the adhesive performance of a Transdermal Delivery System (TDS) or topical patch in support of an ANDA in the guidance for industry Assessing Adhesion with Transdermal Delivery Systems and Topical Patches for ANDAs. The recommendations provided in the guidance will supersede the recommendations related to adhesion studies provided in individual product-specific recommendations published before the guidance was issued. Accordingly, FDA will RTR an ANDA for failure to follow the recommendations in the guidance once the final guidance is issued.\n\nMatrix Systems\n\nANDAs for matrix transdermal systems should be supported by stability data on three batches of drug product manufactured from three distinct laminates, where each batch of laminate is made using different lots of API, adhesives, backing, and/or other critical elements in the drug product. If an applicant is seeking approval for multiple strengths of a particular drug product, the applicant can choose to use a bracket approach by manufacturing three batches of the highest and lowest strengths and at least one batch of each of the bracketed strengths. An example is given below. * Laminate Batch # 1 (pilot-scale): All strengths (highest, lowest, and bracketed) * Laminate Batch # 2 (pilot-scale): Highest and lowest strengths * Laminate Batch # 3 (pilot- or small-scale): Highest and lowest strengths\n* Reservoir Systems\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]\n\ncontainer as the RLD. Therefore, a deviation from the fill volume (total drug content) of the RLD parenteral drug product may constitute a change in strength. A change in strength must first be approved via the suitability petition process (see section III.F of this guidance) before it can be proposed in an ANDA submission.\n\n3. Differences in Packaging and/or Labeling That May Be Associated With the Safe/Effective Use of the Drug Product\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA on a case-by-case basis if the ANDA contains differences in packaging and/or labeling from the RLD that may be associated with safe/effective use of the drug product.66 Generally, if the RLD is packaged with certain labeling in a manner to ensure its proper administration, the test product should be packaged and labeled similarly. For example, an RLD product may incorporate labeling on its packaging that contains a combination of visual and/or typographical aids, beyond the direct label text, to facilitate patient compliance and safety. Blister packaging is an example of such packaging, whereby certain drug products communicate crucial patient information directly on the blister carton (and/or the blister itself) to both improve patient compliance and reduce the incidence of harm or injury that may result from improper administration of the drug product. A blister carton may also better allow any supplemental patient information to be attached directly to it, which in turn ensures that each patient receives the necessary drug product information upon dispensing from a pharmacy. Such a proposed product should generally be packaged similarly to the RLD to account for these considerations.\n\nFootnote 66: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8).\n\n4. Other Inconsistencies\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA contains certain other inconsistencies. In accordance with 21 CFR 314.94(a)(4), an ANDA must include a statement that the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling proposed for the drug product have been previously approved for the RLD. However, there are certain exceptions (e.g., for labeling differences permitted pursuant to an approved suitability petition that is cited as an ANDA's basis of submission (see section III.F for further details)). Any other proposed condition-of-use changes would not be acceptable. Examples of proposed condition-of-use changes may include, but are not limited to, citing a sprinkle capsule dosage form as a basis of submission but producing a capsule that cannot be administered in the same manner as the RLD, or proposing alterations to either the amount of active ingredient delivered per dose or the dosing regimen such that neither are consistent with those described in the RLD labeling.\n\nAppendix H Microbiology Considerations\n\nGenerally, FDA will RTR an ANDA if it contains certain deficiencies related to microbiology considerations.\n\nAn ANDA should contain all sterility assurance validation studies for terminally sterilized drug products and aseptically filled drug products, as described below67:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTerminally sterilized drug products\n\nValidation of production terminal sterilization process\n\nValidation of depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nAseptically filled drug products\n\nValidation of the sterilizing grade filters (bacterial retention studies)\n\nValidation of the sterilization of sterile bulk drug or product contact equipment, components, containers, and closures\n\nValidation of the depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of the aseptic filling process/line/room (media fills/process simulations)\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nIn addition, an ANDA should include at the time of submission, at minimum, summaries of validation studies.\n\nVI Bioequivalence and clinical deficiencies\n\nAs a general matter, ANDA applicants should refer to FDA's \"Product Specific Recommendations for Generic Drug Development\" website for Bioequivalence (BE) guidances regarding recommended in vivo and/or in vitro BE and other recommended studies.68\n\nFootnote 68: FDA\u2019s BE recommendations for specific products can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDA Submissions -- Refuse-to-Receive Standards Rev.2 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.0621252059936523", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: Stability testing for certain drug products and components\n\nPeriodic examinations of data and of reserve samples\n\nIf the demand for MNPs cannot be met by the measures described above, manufacturers can consider reducing activities that are more directly connected with batch manufacturing or a product accept/reject decision provided that they have a documented rationale or risk assessment to show that the proposed changes will not unacceptably reduce assurance of product quality. Examples include:\n\nNot requiring second-person verification of activities for less critical steps (though we recommend a self-check of work)\n\nReducing the number of samples for labor-intensive laboratory testing\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nForgoing an in-process test to assure adequacy of mix, particularly when making successive batches, where the risk is judged to be low in terms of drug safety and efficacy\n\nDelaying completion of deviation investigations of minor events\n\nCDER recommends that in taking such measures, firms plan to carefully monitor indicators of product quality to note any unfavorable trends or shifts as a result of the implementation of the Plan. CDER also recommends that firms retain samples for testing at a later date in cases where testing is reduced or omitted because of lack of resources.\n\nReturning to Normal Operations\n\nA critical component of any emergency Plan is a procedure detailing when and how the transition back to pre-emergency, or normal, operations should occur. Once the Plan has been activated, it should remain active continuously until there is a reasonable expectation that normal operations will be maintainable for an extended period of time. The Plan should consider:\n\nWhat factors will indicate that it is time to return to normal operations or deactivate the Plan\n\nWhat resources will be necessary to complete postponed activities\n\nWhat activities will enable a successful transition back to normal operations\n\nThe following questions can stimulate some useful ideas for consideration and inclusion in the Plan:\n\nWhat information should be used to signal a return to normal operations (e.g., percentage of absenteeism in critical manufacturing and/or laboratory positions has remained below X percent for Y number of consecutive days)?\n\nHow should efforts to resume processes suspended during the emergency be prioritized?\n\nWhat is the most efficient method to address delayed activities such as sample analysis and equipment calibrations?\n\nHow should issues resulting from the execution of the Plan (e.g., out of specification test results, deviations, unusual complaints) be reported to CDER?\n\nWhat mechanism is most appropriate to review and summarize activities taken during Plan activation?\n\nCDER encourages companies to maintain awareness of the emergency on the local, national, and global scale as much as possible. This awareness will help the company anticipate potential future concerns or imminent hazards that could affect their decision to resume normal operations or continue operating under their Plan. CDER also recommends that firms conduct a formal post-execution assessment of the execution outcomes and update their Plan as appropriate.\n\nNotifying CDER\n\nIt is probable that despite every effort to avoid shortages, the very nature of an emergency makes shortages of products possible or even likely. To foster communication between companies and CDER and protect the national public health, we encourage manufacturers to include a procedure in their Plan for notifying CDER when the Plan is activated and when returning to normaloperations. These communications are intended to help CDER maintain awareness of any potential shortage situations and act accordingly to avoid or mitigate them. During periods when manufacturers are experiencing high rates of absenteeism, it is possible that CDER will also experience staff shortages. In such circumstances, CDER's ability to confirm receipt or subsequent activities could be delayed. We suggest that notifications of this nature include the following information, and be sent to CDERStaffingNotice@FDA.HHS.GOV:\n\nWithin 1 day of Plan activation:\n\nManufacturing facilities affected\n\nDate the Plan is implemented at each affected facility\n\nContact information for site-responsible person\n\nCompany-identified criteria that have triggered activation of the Plan\n\nProducts to be manufactured under the altered procedures of the Plan (include NDA, ANDA, and BLA numbers)\n\nProducts to have manufacturing temporarily delayed (include NDA, ANDA, BLA numbers)\n\nAny anticipated or potential shortages\n\nQuantity of finished product on hand for any product with an anticipated or potential shortage\n\nWithin 1 day of the Plan deactivation:\n\nManufacturing facilities affected\n\nDate the Plan was implemented at each affected facility\n\nDate each affected facility returned to normal operations\n\nContact information for site-responsible person\n\nIf, after releasing a MNP under the Plan, a firm obtains information leading to suspicion that the product might be defective, the firm should contact CDER immediately in adherence to existing recall reporting regulations (21 CFR 7.40) or defect reporting requirements for drug application products (21 CFR 314.81(b)) and therapeutic biological products regulated by CDER (21 CFR 600.14).\n\nDocumenting Emergency Activities\n\nCDER recommends that manufacturers evaluate changes to be made in accordance with the execution of the Plan and manage those changes having the potential to affect product quality in accordance with the CGMP requirements. Records that support decisions to carry out changes to approved procedures for manufacturing and release of products under the Plan should be retained at the site in accordance with the CGMP requirements (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180). Records FDA expects to be available include but are not limited to the following:\n\nAny supporting documentation for the Plan, including risk assessments and management approval for any change to an approved procedure or activity (e.g., delaying, substituting, or reducing the frequency of an approved procedure or activity)\n\nLot numbers and application numbers of each product manufactured under the Plan\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnalytical data and relevant records for all products manufactured under an unapproved or nonstandard process, including the outcomes of delayed activities that are part of approved procedures or requirements for batch release (e.g., results from delayed specification tests)\n\nTimeline for completion of delayed or substituted activities that are part of the approved application or standard operating procedures, such as sample analysis and equipment calibrations and outcomes\n\nIf these records were to be reviewed during an inspection, FDA will consider the prevailing circumstances and the rationale used by a manufacturer to justify any observed discrepancies or deviations from a manufacturer's standard operating procedures and approved application(s).\n\nIV Optimization and Demonstration of Preparedness\n\nThe optimization of an emergency plan can be an iterative process that involves drafting, reviewing, testing, and revising the Plan, perhaps more than once. Optimization can involve progressing from a simple discussion-based \"table top\" event toward a more elaborate simulation demonstrating the capability of the Plan. To derive the most benefit from this process, any tests should strive to simulate anticipated emergency conditions as closely as possible and should be conducted in a no-fault environment with the goal to improve the plan and not place blame for mistakes or oversights.\n\nEach company should determine the most appropriate approach to ensure preparedness for execution of the Plan. CDER recommends that manufacturers conduct practice drills before an emergency appears imminent to increase familiarity of personnel at all levels with the Plan and their responsibilities under the Plan. CDER recommends considering the following activities, if feasible and practical:\n\nPracticing activation and deactivation of the Plan, involving all levels and roles within the company\n\nHaving fully trained employees observe cross-trained employees during an exercise and provide immediate constructive feedback\n\nCarrying out contingency analytical procedures in conjunction with standard procedures\n\nAny observations or outcomes resulting from these activities should be used to optimize the Plan and minimize any potential safety or product quality concerns. These corrections are typically best addressed through a formal meeting process following the exercise.\n\nV Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 72 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or suggestions for reducing this burden to:\n\nOffice of Counter-Terrorism and Emergency Coordination, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 51, rm. 3341, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information in 21 CFR 7.40 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0249; the collections of information in 21 CFR part 211 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0139; the collections of information in 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1) have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0001; the collections of information in 21 CFR 600.14 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0458.\n--------------------\nContext title: Planning for the Effects of High Absenteeism to Ensure Availability of Medically Necessary Drug Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.4312894344329834", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.1.3 Selection of Batches (2.1.3)\n\nData from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the drug substance. The batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route as production batches and using a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on formal stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nii.1.4 Container Closure System (2.1.4)\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the drug substance packaged in a container closure system that is the same as or simulates the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\nii.1.5 Specification (2.1.5)\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, is addressed in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances and Q6B__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Biotechnological/Biological Products. In addition, specification for degradation products in a drug substance is discussed in ICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances.\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed should depend on the results from validation studies.\n\nTesting Frequency (2.1.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug substance. For drug substances with a proposed retest period of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed retest period.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that the results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nStorage Conditions (2.1.7)\n\nIn general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug substances are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug substance is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) or (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}).\n\n** If (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) and significant change occurs at any time during 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. Testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all tests, unless otherwise justified. The initial application should include a minimum of 6 months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\nSignificant change for a drug substance is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\nData from refrigerated storage should be assessed according to the evaluation section of this guidance, except where explicitly noted below.\n\nIf significant change occurs between 3 and 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the real time data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\nIf significant change occurs within the first 3 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling). This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the drug substance for a period shorter than 3 months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test a drug substance through 6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.\n\nFor drug substances intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period should be based on the real time data obtained at the long-term storage condition. In the absence of an accelerated storage condition for drug substances intended to be stored in a freezer, testing on a single batch at an elevated temperature (e.g., (5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) or (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})) for an appropriate time period should be conducted to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling).\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) (2.1.7.4)\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) should be treated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8 Stability Commitment (2.1.8)\n\nWhen available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed retest period granted at the time of approval, a commitment should be made to continue the stability studies postapproval to firmly establish the retest period.\n\nWhere the submission includes long-term stability data on three production batches covering the proposed retest period, a postapproval commitment is considered unnecessary. Otherwise, one of the following commitments should be made:\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period and to place additional production batches, to a total of at least three, on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission does not include stability data on production batches, a commitment should be made to place the first three production batches on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nThe stability protocol used for long-term studies for the stability commitment should be the same as that for the primary batches, unless otherwise scientifically justified.\n\n9.1.9 Evaluation (2.1.9)\n\nThe purpose of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance and evaluating the stability information (including, as appropriate, results of the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the drug substance manufactured under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification throughout the assigned retest period.\n\nThe data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under these circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis; providing a justification for the omission should be sufficient.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7473126649856567", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: 4 Stability Requirements\n\nDrug Substance Stability\n\nDrug substance stability data to define a re-test period is not applicable as the drug substance is not isolated and stored in an integrated process.

The integrated flow diagram can be provided in CTD section 3.2.P and referenced in section 3.2.S.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis annex describes examples of approaches for managing transient disturbances (hereafter referred to as disturbances in this annex) that may occur during CM. The discussion points presented here are not exhaustive. Alternative approaches can be used.\n\n2 Background\n\nDisturbances may result in a variation in material quality. The impact of some variations on material quality in an earlier process step may be resolved by downstream process steps. The extent of variations and the ability to resolve them in subsequent steps are impacted by the amplitude, duration, and frequency of the disturbance. Identification of tolerable ranges for these parameters and establishing appropriate acceptance criteria will enable the development of an effective strategy for managing disturbances.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.6846415996551514", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.3.5.7 Stability\n\nThe drug product applicant may reference a master file to address all questions in this section.\n\nWhat stability studies support the retest or expiry period and the storage conditions?\n\nInformation should include a summary of the stability data in tabular format (e.g., ranges of results), the conclusions reached regarding stability, and the retest or expiry period.\n\nWhat are the conditions and tests for the stability program?\n\nWhat is the proposed commercial packaging and how does it compare with the packaging chosen for the stability program?\n\nWhat is the justification for the stability tests and specifications chosen?\n\nIf there are any differences between release and stability specifications, provide justification.\n\nWhat are the stability protocol and post-approval stability commitment?\n\nThe stability protocol should describe the test specifications (methods, acceptance criteria, etc.), testing intervals, storage conditions, retest or expiry period, and packaging.\n\nThe post-approval stability commitment should include:\n\nThe first three production lots followed by 3-10% of the production lots (with a minimum of one lot per year);\n\nA commitment to report the stability data annually; and\n\nA commitment to withdraw from the market any production lot(s) found with out-of-specification results and investigate those lots immediately before and after the lot(s) in question.\n\nFor more details, see CVM GFI #5: Drug Stability Guidelines.\"\n\nIII DRUG PRODUCT (2.3.P) QUESTIONS\n\n2.3.p.1 Description and Composition\n\nWhat is the dosage form (provide description)? What are the components\n\nand composition of the final product? What is the function of each excipient?\n\nWhat is the physical description of the drug product? What are the available strengths, route of administration, release mechanism, as well as any other distinguishable characteristics?\n\nAn example of an appropriate response would be - \"The proposed drug product is available as an oval, round, immediate-release, aqueous film coated tablet in three strengths (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg).\"\n\nWhat is the function of each component in the drug product?\n\nList in tabular format (see example table below). Include all components used in the manufacture of the drug product (such as solvents and processing aids) even if removed during processing. Indicate which components are compendial. For each strength, list the quantitative composition of the finished dosage form. Excipient grade should be discussed in 2.3.P.4 (Control of Excipients). The total amount of material in pilot and production batches goes in 2.3.P.3 (Manufacture).\n\nExample\n\nIngredient Function Weight/Tablet % (w/w)\n\n[Drug substance] Active\n\n[Excipient] Solvent* N/A N/A\n\nTotal weight\n\nRemoved during the manufacturing process.\n\nDoes this product contain multiple processing steps?\n\nFor example: tablet cores or beads.\n\nWhat is the composition of the significant intermediates?\n\nAre there any overages in the formulation of the product? What is the justification for the overages?\n\nIdentify and justify any formulation overages that appear in the final product. Manufacturing overages should be discussed in 2.3.P.3.\n\nFor animal generic drug products, note that, in general, the only acceptable justification for an overage in the final drug product formulation is the demonstration of a similar overage in the reference listed drug (RLD).\n\n2.3.4 Conclusions\n\nDoes this product contain any materials with sizes in the nanometer ranges (<1 (\\mu)m)?\n\nFor generic products, do the differences between this formulation and the reference listed new animal drug (RLNAD) present potential concerns with respect to therapeutic equivalence?\n\nDescribe any efforts taken to ensure the therapeutic equivalence to the RLD. If known, provide the formulation of the RLD.\n\n2.3.5.2 Pharmaceutical Development\n\nWhile the inclusion of a Pharmaceutical Development Report (PDR) is optional, a PDR provides a brief summary of the final drug product development. CVM considers the information in the PDR, such as a description of the research that led to the evolution and selection of components, formulation, specifications, etc. of the final product, very helpful in demonstrating process understanding. This may include information about alternative formulations that were tried and deemed not to be optimal. Important aspects of a useful PDR are described below. It is important to note that a PDR is most informative to CVM in describing why a component or a process was chosen.\n\nThe studies included in a PDR are distinct from the routine control tests conducted according to specifications, such as release or stability testing. Summary results from studies or references to relevant literature should be included in the PDR or as an attachment to the PDR.\n\n2.3.5.2 Components of the Product\n\nApplicants should explain the rationale behind the selection of the components of the drug product--the drug substance and the excipients used.\n\n2.3.5.1 Drug Substance\n\nWhich properties or physical chemical characteristics of the drug substance affect drug product development, manufacture, or performance?\n\nWhat are the key physicochemical characteristics of the drug substance selected, in particular those that can influence the performance or manufacture of the final drug product?\n\nPhysicochemical properties that may be of interest and concern include water content, solubility, particle size distribution, pH, pKa, or the existence of polymorphic forms. If the drug substance has been structurally modified from the active moiety, such as made into a salt, the applicant should discuss whether the modification will impact the manufacture and/or the quality of the drug product.\n\nAre any of the key physicochemical properties determined to potentially influence the performance of the drug product? What studies were conducted to establish and to justify the drug substance specification?\n\nWhat drug substance(s) (including grade) was selected?\n\nIs there more than one drug substance in your product? What evidence supports the compatibility of the drug substances with each other?\n\nIf there is any incompatibility identified, justify the use of the drug substance with summary data, such as stability data or studies examining the impurities that arise from the interaction of the drug substance and the additional drug substance.\n\n2.3.P.2.1.2 Excipients\n\nWhat evidence supports compatibility between the excipients and the drug substance?\n\nWhat compatibility screening was performed during the pre-formulation stage?\n\nDiscuss the issue of compatibility of the drug substance with the excipients in the drug product. The compatibility study should include a simulation of the most extreme conditions that the drug substance and excipients will be subjected to during the actual manufacturing process. The design and results of the screening should be provided and discussed.\n\nWere any excipients found to be incompatible with the drug substance or with each other? Which excipients were found to be incompatible, and how was their selection justified?\n\nAny excipients which were found to be incompatible with the drug substance should be identified. The selection of the excipients used in the final formulation should be justified using the results of the compatibility screening.\n\nFor generic products, were any attempts made to determine what excipients were used in the pioneer product?\n\nIf the excipients in the pioneer product being copied are not defined, describe attempts made to determine what they were. If identification was confirmed, and a decision was made to intentionally use different excipients, provide justification for using the ones ultimately chosen for use in the final formulation. If identification was not attempted or was not possible, provide rationale for the excipients chosen.\n\n2.3.P.2.2 Drug Product\n\nWhat attributes should the drug product possess?\n\nAre there critical attributes that ensure product quality for the intended use and route of administration? Describe the critical attributes.\n\nThis section should identify and describe the formulation and process attributes (critical parameters) that may influence batch reproducibility, product performance and drug product quality.\n\nIs the drug product an immediate release or controlled release? Describe the release mechanism.\n\nThe specific release mechanism should be described and the development studies leading to the final release mechanism should be summarized. The type of information may vary substantially since the development of release mechanisms will vary between different formulations, such as coated tablets versus in-situ forming gels.\n\nHow was the drug product designed to have these attributes?\n\nFor release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n\nFor example, does it use an enteric coating or slow release matrix.\n\nAre any overages used in the drug product? Why is an overage necessary?\n\nThe applicant should describe and justify the amount of the overage if needed to ensure dose delivery. This overage should also be included in the composition and batch formula.\n\nAre there any special design features of the product?\n\nA rationale should be given for these design features to support their appropriateness.\n\nWere alternative formulations or mechanisms investigated?\n\nWhat formulations were used to produce the clinical batches for safety and effectiveness studies?\n\nAre there differences in formulation between the clinical or pilot batches and that proposed for commercial batches? Describe the different formulations.\n\nApplicants should provide the complete list of formulations in the evolution of the final formulation. The rationale or justification should be given for differences in formulations between the commercial and clinical or stability batches. This information may include comparative in vitro or in vivo studies to link the clinical formulation(s) with the proposed commercial formulation.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #234 Question-Based Review for the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Technical Section of Animal Drug Applications \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.7805049419403076"], "According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter IV.

For example, if the directions on your label say to take 1-3 tablets with breakfast, the serving size would be 3 tablets.\n\n21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2 in the Miscellaneous Category\n\n5 May I use flexibility in the wording for \"Serving Size?\"\n\nNo. You must use the term \"Serving Size.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)\n\nNutrient Declaration\n\nWhat nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nTotal calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron must be listed when they are present in measurable amounts. A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as \"zero\" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for \"% Daily Value\" that refers to the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, not in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel. Ingredients in dietary supplements that are not dietary ingredients, such as binders, excipients, fillers, must be included in the ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nMust I declare vitamin E when it occurs naturally in my product and I make no claim for it?\n\nNo. Because Vitamin E is not one of the 14 mandatory dietary ingredients, it does not need to be declared when it occurs naturally.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMay I declare protein on the label if my product contains only individual amino acids?\n\nNo. You may not declare protein on your products that contain only amino acids.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMust I list the dietary ingredients in my products in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list \"folic acid\" or \"folacin\" without parentheses in place of \"folate.\" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.0493738651275635", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and \"other carbohydrate\" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the \"Nutrition Facts\" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \"Nutrition Facts\" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for \"Calories,\" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for \"Calories\" and the numeric value of \"Calories.\" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" declaration now immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" is the declaration of \"Serving size.\" \"Serving size\" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the \"Serving size\" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the \"Serving size\" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry\" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics\" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile \"Calories from fat\" can no longer be declared, \"Calories from saturated fat\" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare \"Added Sugars\" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for \"Total Sugars\" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The 'X' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that \"added sugars\" are a subcomponent of \"total sugars.\" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement \"Contains less than 1 gram\" or, alternatively, \"less than 1 gram\" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.0188894271850586", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFood Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Guidance for Industry\n\nSmall Entity Compliance Guide\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling\n\nNutrition Programs Staff, HFS-830\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-1450\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (\"the final rule\"). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" and \"I\" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of \"infants\" (or \"infants 7 to 12 months\") and \"children less than 4 years\" have been changed to \"infants through 12 months\" and \"children 1 through 3 years of age\" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines \"food\" as: \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of \"drug\") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of \"food,\" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.9517765045166016", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: (laboratory value / label value) x 100 = %\n\nIn order to evaluate the accuracy of nutrition label information against a standard for compliance purposes, FDA regulations define two nutrient classes (Class I and Class II) (2i CFR 101.9(g)(3)) and list a third group (Third Group) of nutrients (2i CFR 101.9(g)(5)). Class I nutrients are those added in fortified or fabricated foods. These nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. Class I nutrients must be present at 100% or more of the value declared on the label ; in other words, the nutrient content identified by the laboratory analysis must be at least equal to the label value. For example, if vitamin C is added in a fortified product and the label states that vitamin C is present at 10% Daily Value (DV), the laboratory value must equal at least 6 mg of vitamin C/serving (i.e., 10% of the 60 mg Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C that is specified in 2i CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The ratio between a laboratory finding of 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving (i.e., 8% DV) and the label value of 10% DV would be calculated as follows:\n\n(8% / 10%) x 100 = 80% or (4.8 mg / 6 mg) x 100 = 80%\n\nand the label value would not be in compliance.\n\nClass II nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat, or potassium that occur naturally in a food product. Class II nutrients must be present at 80% or more of the value declared on the label. As an example: If vitamin C is a naturally occurring nutrient in a product, and the product declares 10% DV vitamin C (i.e., 6 mg/serving) on its label, then laboratory analysis must find at least 80% of the label value (80% of 6 mg or 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving) for the product to be in compliance.\n\nThe Third Group nutrients include calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. However, for products (e.g., fruit drinks, juices, and confectioneries) with a sugars content of 90 percent or more of total carbohydrate, to prevent labeling anomalies due in part to rounding, FDA treats total carbohydrate as a Third Group nutrient instead of a Class II nutrient. For foods with label declarations of Third Group nutrients, the ratio between the amount obtained by laboratory analysis and the amount declared on the product label in the Nutrition Facts panel must be 120% or less, i.e., the label is considered to be out of compliance if the nutrient content of a composite of the product is greater than 20% above the value declared on the label. For example, if a laboratory analysis found 8 g of total fat/serving in a product that started that it contained 6 g of total fat/serving, the ratio between the laboratory value and the label value would be (8 / 6) x 100 = 133%, and the product label would be considered to be out of compliance.\n\nReasonable excesses of class I and II nutrients above labeled amounts and reasonable deficiencies of the Third Group nutrients are usually considered acceptable by the agency within good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhy Submit a Data Base to FDA?\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(8), compliance with the provisions set forth in 2i CFR 101.9(g)(1) through (g)(6) may be provided by use of an FDA approved data base that has been developed following FDA guideline procedures and where food samples have been handled in accordance with current good manufacturing practice to prevent nutrient loss. An approval is granted when FDA has agreed to all aspects of the data base in writing or when a clear need is presented (e.g., raw produce and seafood). Approvals are granted for a limited time and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices. Guidance in the use of data bases may be found in this document, the FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual--a Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.\n\nFDA published its policy concerning the review of data bases for use in the voluntary and mandatory nutrition labeling of foods in a final rule entitled \"Guidelines for the Voluntary Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruits, Vegetables, and Fish\" in the Federal Register of August 16, 1996 (6i FR 42742). This policy is the most recent such statement of the policy made by the agency and will be referred to throughout the manual.\n\nFDA states that upon submission of a data base, \"firms are free...to begin use of the nutrient label values and to initiate the planned studies to collect and update nutrient values. During this interim period, FDA does not anticipate that it will take action against a product bearing label values included in a data base submitted to the agency for review. If any product is identified through FDA compliance activities as including label values that are out of compliance, contingent on the company's willingness to come into compliance, the agency intends to work with both the manufacturer and the data base developer to understand and correct the problem label values\" (6i FR 42742).\n\n23.8.25.2.317.31\n\nChapter II: How to Develop a Nutrition Labeling Data Base\n\nFDA recommends five general steps that industry may choose to follow in the development of a nutrition labeling data base:\n\ncharacterizing the product(s);\n\ndesigning a sampling plan;\n\ncollecting the sample units;\n\nanalyzing the laboratory test samples; and\n\nstatistically analyzing the data and interpreting the results.\n\nThis chapter will address each of the five steps. Each of the steps can be performed in several different ways, and decisions made regarding the alternatives may directly impact the available resources, data quality (error in a data set), and the statistically defined risk of making a correct decision. Please note that this manual is not intended to be a statistics book or a comprehensive sampling text. Data base developers may need to consult the scientific literature, and in some cases, a statistician or research analyst to obtain additional detailed information that is relevant to the data base(s) of interest, but that is not contained in this manual.\n\nThis chapter, with the examples and definitions that are given, should serve as a general guide for individuals needing a basic reference concerning some of the administrative and statistical considerations that are associated with the development of a data base.\n\n1 Characterizing the Product(s)\n\nIn characterizing the product, one should first determine the innate nutrient makeup of the product and obtain preliminary estimates of nutrient levels, nutrient variation, and the factors that could impact nutrient levels and variation. The first step in describing a product or products is to perform a literature search to determine if there are (1) existing nutrient data; (2) estimates that describe the market (production and sales); and, if appropriate, (3) information that describes the varieties (or species, if applicable); (4) the regions where the food is grown or raised; and (5) factors already studied and known to impact or not to impact nutrient levels. If the scientific literature and other sources reveal that a nutrient is known to be absent from the food or is present in negligible amounts (e.g., sugars and dietary fiber in seafood, cholesterol and saturated fat in produce), then the agency will not require testing for that nutrient, as long as the data base developer includes supporting documentation (58 FR 2079 at 2019, January 6, 1993).\n\nIf no information is available that adequately describes the food and its nutrients, the data base developer may choose to perform a pilot study to determine if certain factors do impact nutrient levels, to determine if there are regional differences in the nutrient levels, or to test for nutrient losses over time. In addition, the developer may choose to include other relevant factors of interest in a proposal to collect nutrient data for a data base study. For fruits and vegetables, variability may arise from seasonal and geographic influences associated with such factors as variety, location (e.g., soil type, climatic conditions); growing conditions (e.g., planting time, irrigation and fertilization practices, harvest maturity); product transport (e.g, packing, shipping, storage); and processing practices. For seafoods, the variability in nutrient levels may arise from such factors as species, dietary habits, processing practices, etc. For \"mixed products\", in addition to the factors that influence the variation in the nutrient levels in the product ingredients, processing factors associated with the formulation of the product ingredients into the \"mixed product\" may also influence the variation in the nutrient levels of the finished product. In some instances, if there is a great difference in nutrient values attributable to a particular factor (e.g., different nutrient values for different food types), a data base developer may determine that the foods are different and may even consider different nutrition labels for different food types.\n\nWhen a data base developer submits a proposal to FDA, it is important to include the results of any pilot or experimental study that was completed. One data base developer, for example, completed a number of experimental studies that determined differences in nutrient levels between/among several independent variables (e.g., variety of food (2 levels), site of sampling (production vs. retail), packing medium (brine vs. water), geographical region (5 levels), and age of product (5 levels)). FDA requests that the results of any experimental study that is submitted to the agency be included in statistical tables to better describe the type(s) of statistical test used, the sample size, and the exact probability levels that were used in drawing conclusions based on these results.\n\nIn determining the sampling plan (next section), existing nutrient data are extremely helpful in determining the number of samples to test.\n\n2 Designing a Sampling Plan\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5701929330825806", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement \"Not a significant source of ____\" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when \"circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply\" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, \"FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.\"\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the \"Not a significant source of ____\" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as \"Not a significant source of other nutrients\" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA's labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be \"packaged and sold individually,\" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement \"This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale\" or \"This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale\" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The \"principal display panel\" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The \"information panel\" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), \"Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber\"). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.0526018142700195"], "As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Q4: What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n\nA4: An appropriate representation of the geriatric population (including patients with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities) should be enrolled in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in the geriatric population and allow for comparisons with the nongeriatric population. This information would ordinarily be expected in a marketing application. In general, it is preferable to include both nongeriatric and geriatric patients in the same study(ies), which can facilitate observation of age-related differences. In some cases, a separate study in the geriatric population can be preferable. Every effort should be made to include geriatric patients using concomitant therapies and with co-morbidities in the premarketing clinical development program. In some cases, enrollment of these patients can be challenging and it could be appropriate to collect data postmarketing. However, the adequacy of, and the need for, data in these patients should be considered during drug development and discussed in the marketing application submission. Where enrollment of geriatric patients has been insufficient despite the efforts of the applicant, a specific plan to collect data postmarketing should be discussed during development and presented in the marketing application. Information relevant to the geriatric patient population, including any limitations, should be reflected in the product labeling.\n\nQ5: Are there concerns related to the data specific to the geriatric population that could be considered in the planning of the clinical studies?\n\nDepending on the mechanism of action of the drug and/or the characteristics of the disease, certain specific adverse events and age-related efficacy endpoints should be actively sought in the geriatric population, e.g., effects on cognitive function, balance and falls, urinary incontinence or retention, weight loss, and sarcopenia. This may require specific testing, e.g., for cognitive function. Applicants should also refer to disease specific guidances for specific recommendations concerning the evaluation of both efficacy and safety in geriatric patients.\n\nQ6: In light of recent advances in the field of pharmacokinetics and assessment of drug-drug interactions since the ICH E7 guidance was established, what studies should be considered when developing a drug that will be used in geriatric patients?\n\nThe pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients (over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population) should be evaluated to identify age-related differences that are not explained by other factors such as reduced renal function or weight differences. The potential influence of impaired renal/hepatic function, as well as potential drug interactions, is often assessed in studies with nongeriatric subjects. Population pharmacokinetic analysis could provide the requested data if a sufficient number of patients in different age ranges (including patients (\\geq)65 and (\\geq)75 years) are included in the clinical trials. The applicability of population pharmacokinetics is dependent on several factors, e.g. the representation of the target population, the pharmacokinetics of the drug, dosing regimens, and analytical requirements. A specific pharmacokinetic study comparing nongeriatric and geriatric subjects in the same study (matched for relevant covariates, e.g., weight, sex) could achieve the same goals. More details on the pharmacokinetic approach (population pharmacokinetics, the appropriate design of a specific pharmacokinetic study) and assessment of drug-drug interactions can be discussed with the regulatory agencies.\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations; Geriatrics; Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.210097312927246", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nCurrent version\n\ndated July 6, 2010\n\nIn order to facilitate the implementation of the E7 guideline, the ICH Experts have developed a series of Q&As:\n\nE7 Q&As\n\nDocument History\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|} \\hline\nCode & History & Date \\ \\hline E7 Q&As & Approval by the ICH Steering Committee under Step 2 & 18 September \\  & & 2009 \\ \\hline E7 Q&As & Approval by the ICH Steering Committee under Step 4 & 6 July 2010 \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIn general it is preferable to include both non-geriatric and geriatric patients in the same study(ies), which can facilitate observation of age-related differences.

More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug's chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug's benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.029795711860060692", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Critical force Industry E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:\n\nGeriatrics\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nFebruary 2012\n\nICH\n\nChapter 6 Evidence for Industry\n\nE7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:\n\nCeriatrics\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications\n\nDivision of Drug Information, WO51, Room 2201\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave.\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\n\nPhone: 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-847-8714\n\ndruginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and\n\nDevelopment, HFM-40\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-1448\n\n(Tel) 800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nFebruary 2012\n\nICH\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

The Q&As in this document have been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, July 2010. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan, and the United States.\n\nE7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe ICH guidance E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:__Geriatrics provides recommendations on special considerations that apply in the design and conduct of clinical trials of medicines that are likely to have significant use in the elderly. Since the E7 guidance was made final, experiences implementing the guidance in the ICH regions have given rise to requests for clarification. This question and answer (Q&A) document is intended to clarify key issues. FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: Why do we need an adequate representation of geriatric patients in the clinical database?\n\nA1: Geriatric patients can respond differently from younger patients to drug therapy in a number of ways, and such differences can be greater in patients 75 years and older: (a) The geriatric population has age-related physiological changes that can affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug and the pharmacodynamic response to the drug, both of which can influence the drug-response and the dose response relationship. (b) Geriatric patients are more prone to adverse effects since they often have comorbidities and are taking concomitant therapies that could interact with the investigational drug. The adverse effects can be more severe, or less tolerated, and have more serious consequences than in the nongeriatric population. With the increasing size of the geriatric population (including patients 75 and older) and in view of the recent advances in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics since the ICH E7 guidance was established in 1993, the importance of geriatric data (from the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population) in a drug evaluation program has increased. Not all potential differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, disease-drug interactions, drug-drug interactions, and clinical response that can occur in the geriatric population can be predicted from nongeriatric populations, as the geriatric patients are far more likely to have multiple illnesses and to be receiving multiple drugs. Therefore, to assess the benefit/risk balance of a drug that will be used in the geriatric population, these patients should be appropriately represented in clinical trials. Q2: What should be taken into account when estimating an adequate representation of geriatric patients to be included in the clinical database?\n\nA2: It is very important to ensure, to the extent possible, that the population included in the clinical development program is representative of the target patient population. As stated in the current ICH E7 guidance, estimates of the prevalence of the disease to be treated by age or examination of the age distribution of usage for other drugs of the same class or for the same indication should be provided by the applicant. This will indicate the expected use of the drug and should influence the number of geriatric patients to be included in the marketing application. The current guidance states, \"for drugs used in diseases not unique to, but present in, the elderly, a minimum of 100 patients would usually allow detection of clinically important differences.\" Given the increasing prevalence and the growing recognition of thecomplexity of the geriatric population, including concomitant therapies and co-morbidities, it would usually be appropriate to include more than 100 geriatric patients in the phase 2 and 3 databases and include patients over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population. In the marketing application, depending on the numbers of patients, data should be presented for various age groups (for example (<)65, 65-74, 75-84, and (\\geq) 85) to assess the consistency of the treatment effect and safety profile in these patients with the nongeriatric patient population. As single trials may not have sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to allow such analyses, these will often need to be carried out on pooled data. Any such analyses will need to consider consistency across studies.\n\nQ3: Are there any special patient populations or characteristics that are particularly important to address in the planning of the clinical development program?\n\nA3: Geriatric patients often have co-morbidities and concomitant therapies that could interact with the investigational drug and make patients more likely to have undesirable effects and interactions. Therefore, it is important to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug in such patients and to design a study with inclusion/exclusion criteria that allow their participation. There may exist a reluctance to include vulnerable geriatric patients at high risk of adverse outcomes (so-called \"frail\" geriatric patients). However, care in randomization should allow the appropriate attribution of findings either to the investigational drug or to other factors. This applies both to drugs intended for the geriatric patient population and for drugs used in diseases present in, but not unique to, the geriatric population.\n\nQ4: What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n\nA4: An appropriate representation of the geriatric population (including patients with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities) should be enrolled in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in the geriatric population and allow for comparisons with the nongeriatric population. This information would ordinarily be expected in a marketing application. In general, it is preferable to include both nongeriatric and geriatric patients in the same study(ies), which can facilitate observation of age-related differences. In some cases, a separate study in the geriatric population can be preferable. Every effort should be made to include geriatric patients using concomitant therapies and with co-morbidities in the premarketing clinical development program. In some cases, enrollment of these patients can be challenging and it could be appropriate to collect data postmarketing. However, the adequacy of, and the need for, data in these patients should be considered during drug development and discussed in the marketing application submission. Where enrollment of geriatric patients has been insufficient despite the efforts of the applicant, a specific plan to collect data postmarketing should be discussed during development and presented in the marketing application. Information relevant to the geriatric patient population, including any limitations, should be reflected in the product labeling.\n\nQ5: Are there concerns related to the data specific to the geriatric population that could be considered in the planning of the clinical studies?\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations; Geriatrics; Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2757529318332672", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: In 2014, FDA published an action plan titled FDA Action Plan to Enhance the Collection and Availability of Demographic Subgroup Data (FDASIA Action Plan) in response to the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA).2 The FDASIA Action Plan proposes strategies to encourage greater clinical trial participation, including collaborating with industry, other federal agencies, and interested stakeholders to improve clinical trial diversity.\n\nIn 2016, prompted by the FDASIA Action Plan, FDA published the guidance titled Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials, which encourages sponsors to enroll participants who reflect the demographics of clinically relevant populations with regard to age, gender, sex, race, and ethnicity and recommends that sponsors submit a plan to address the inclusion of clinically relevant populations to the Agency.3 FDA**\n\nInclusion of Older Adult Populations\n\nIn November 1989, FDA articulated its support for the inclusion of older adult participants in clinical trials with the release of a guidance for industry titled Guideline for the Study of Drugs Likely to be Used in the Elderly.* In June 1993, within the global pharmaceutical regulatory community, ICH (of which FDA is a member) issued a guideline titled Studies in Support of Special Populations:__Geriatrics E7, which discourages arbitrary maximum age requirements in clinical trial protocols and encourages the inclusion of participants with concomitant illness and those receiving concomitant medications, many of whom are often older adults.4\n\nIn February 2012, an ICH guidance for industry, adopted by FDA, clarifies ICH E7 and emphasizes the importance of including older adult patients in clinical trials, especially patients 75 years or older.5\n\nIn 2014 in the FDASIA Action Plan, FDA reiterated support for efforts to include older adult patients in clinical trials.6\n\n3. Inclusion of Pregnant Women\n\nIn 2016, section 20417 of the 21st Century Cures Act8 required the establishment of a Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women. The task force was charged with providing advice and guidance to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on Federal activities related to identifying and addressing gaps in knowledge and research regarding safe and effective therapies for pregnant women and lactating women.9 Footnote 7: 42 U.S.C. 289a-2, 130 Stat. 1033, 1070.\n\nIn April 2018, FDA published a draft guidance for industry on scientific and ethical considerations for inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials.10\n\nFootnote 8: 130 Stat. 1033, Pub.

Obtaining knowledge of the effectsof medicinal products in pediatricric patients is an important goal. However, this should be done without compromising the well-being of pediatric patients participating in clinical studies. This responsibility is shared by companies, regulatory authorities, health professionals, and society as a whole.\n\n2 Guidance\n\nIssues When Initiating a Pediatric Medicinal Product Development Program\n\nData on the appropriate use of medicinal products in the pediatric population should be generated unless the use of a specific medicinal product in pediatric patients is clearly inappropriate. The timing of initiation of clinical studies in relation to studies conducted in adults, which may be influenced by regional public health and medical needs, is discussed in section 2.3. Justification for the timing and the approach to the clinical program needs to be clearly addressed with regulatory authorities at an early stage and then periodically during the medicinal product development process. The pediatric development program should not delay completion of adult studies and availability of a medicinal product for adults.\n\nThe decision to proceed with a pediatric development program for a medicinal product, and the nature of that program, involve consideration of many factors, including:\n\nThe prevalence of the condition to be treated in the pediatric population\n\nThe seriousness of the condition to be treated\n\nThe availability and suitability of alternative treatments for the condition in the pediatric population, including the efficacy and the adverse event profile (including any unique pediatric safety issues) of those treatments\n\nWhether the medicinal product is novel or one of a class of compounds with known properties\n\nWhether there are unique pediatric indications for the medicinal product\n\nThe need for the development of pediatric-specific endpoints\n\nThe age ranges of pediatric patients likely to be treated with the medicinal product\n\nUnique pediatric (developmental) safety concerns with the medicinal product, including any nonclinical safety issues\n\nPotential need for pediatric formulation development\n\nOf these factors, the most important is the presence of a serious or life-threatening disease for which the medicinal product represents a potentially important advance in therapy. This situation suggests relatively urgent and early initiation of pediatric studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: E11_R1_Addendu\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.452828288078308"], "As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product?

FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.028233528137207", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product?

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if that approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in deciding whether a study of marketed drugs or biological products for treating cancer falls within the exemption under SS 312.2(b)(1) (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) from the general requirement to submit an investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance discusses the Agency's current thinking on when studies of marketed cancer products are exempt from IND regulation based on a risk assessment. The Agency hopes that clarifying its policy will help sponsors identify which studies are exempt, thus saving them from submitting unnecessary IND applications.\n\nThis guidance revises the guidance of the same title published in September 2003. In the September 2003 version, the Agency's final statement was that it believed that most randomized studies of a size that could support a labeling supplement would likely not be exempt from IND regulation under SS 312.2(b)(1)(i), (ii). This is because they would be intended to support approval of a new indication, a significant change in the product labeling, or a significant change in advertising. Experience has shown that this interpretation was formulated too broadly and inappropriately referred to size alone. The Agency has decided to revise this guidance by removing that statement (the last sentence in section V.B). Whether a study could support a change in labeling is a complex determination, based on study design, size, and other factors.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements arecited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nGenerally, regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) require sponsors who wish to study a drug or biological product in humans to submit an IND to the Agency.2 However, these regulations also provide for the exemption of some studies from the requirement to submit an IND if they meet certain criteria. Each year, many INDs for cancer drugs are submitted that contain studies that the Agency determines are exempt. This guidance is intended to help applicants identify which studies may be exempt.\n\nFootnote 2: Part 312 applies to all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or to the licensing provisions of the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)).\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations in SS 312.2(b)(1) provide for the exemption of some studies for some drugs from IND regulations if the studies meet the following five criteria:\n\nThe study is not intended to support FDA approval of a new indication or a significant change in the product labeling.\n\nThe study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent regulations set forth in parts 56 and 50 (21 CFR parts 56 and 50).\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with SS 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs).\n\nRequirements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the specific protocol submitted, and their interpretation is similar for oncologic and nononcologic therapies. Requirement 3 is protocol related and has special meaning in the oncology therapy setting, particularly with respect to doses above the labeled dose, use with other treatments, and use in different populations.\n\nIn the preamble to the IND regulations, which published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1987, the Agency explained that the exemption was not necessarily intended to tie the investigator to the doses and routes of administration and patient population described in the approved labeling, but to permit deviations from the approved labeling to the extent that such changes are supported by the scientific literature and generally known clinical experience. The Agency recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment is exercised in determining whether the planned investigation significantly increases the risk associated with the use of the drug. FDA maintains that \"because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption.\"3\n\nFootnote 3: New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations, Federal Register, March 19, 1987, Vol. 52, Nr. 53, p. 8802.\n\n1996 Agency Cancer Initiative\n\nIn 1996, as part of the President's National Performance Review, the Agency launched its Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs initiative with the goal of accelerating the approval of and expanding patient access to cancer drugs.4 As part of this initiative, the Agency explained that many sponsor-investigators were submitting INDs for exploratory studies for so-called off-label indications for two reasons: (1) IRBs incorrectly believe an IND is required, or (2) the pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to provide a drug free of charge, but mistakenly concludes that the FDA will view this as promotional activity. With the intent of clarifying the Agency's policy and decreasing the number of unnecessary submissions, the Agency emphasized that it would no longer accept INDs considered exempt under SS 312.2(b)(1). (See SS 312.2(b)(4).) Furthermore, FDA stated that providing a drug for study would not, in and of itself, be viewed as a promotional activity if the manufacturer or distributor provides the product for a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation. The Agency explained that it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether an IND is necessary.\n\nFootnote 4: Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs \u2013 Accelerating Approval and Expanding Access (March 1996), CBER, Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturer Assistance, Voice Information System at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, document ID number 0281. Available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genadmin/reincanc.htm\n\nDespite the Agency's attempts to clarify its policy on IND exemptions, many cancer drug IND applications that the Agency determines are exempt from IND regulation are still being submitted unnecessarily. From 1997 to 1999, a majority of investigator IND submissions for marketed cancer drugs were considered exempt (204, 205, and 140 applications in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively).\n\nIII Risk/Benefit analysis in the practice of oncology\n\nAs noted above, a critical question in determining whether a study is exempt involves criterion 3 in the exemption regulations (SS 312.2(b)(1)(iii)): The investigation may not significantly increase the risk associated with use of a drug product. The question of increased risk is determined by assessing the deviation in the planned investigation from the use described in the approved label. In oncology, modifications of labeled dosing recommendations are common and occur as part of oncologists' clinical practice. As outlined below, oncologists are familiar with evaluating the risk of off-label dosing regimens for cancer drug and biological products.\n\nTreatment with cancer drugs may be associated with significant risk from known toxicity. Because effectiveness is often related to dose, a dose close to the maximal tolerated dose is often selected for studies of cancer drugs. This same dose usually becomes the recommended dose in labeling when the new cancer drug is approved with the knowledge that the dose may be altered if it is not tolerated by a patient. Because it is not generally possible to have maximal efficacy in a population without inducing toxicity in some patients, it is not uncommon to observe severe or even lethal side effects from cancer drugs in some patients. In general, these circumstances mean that the toxicity, even potentially lethal toxicity, of cancer drugs is described in approved labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.957828938961029", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: The type and extent of animal or clinical studies that are needed to demonstrate biosimilarity of the proposed product can be influenced by several factors, especially the ability to discern differences between the proposed product and reference product and their potential effect on safety, purity, and potency. For example, factors such as the ability to robustly characterize the proposed product or the reference product (e.g., lack of suitable or sufficiently discriminative analytical techniques) or availability of a relevant drug substance derived from the reference product could affect the nature and extent of subsequent animal or clinical studies.\n\nIn general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. Under certain circumstances, a sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity must include an adequate comparison of the proposed product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. If a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study or a clinical study comparing its proposed product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nAs a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies (e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compares all three products (i.e., the proposed product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product) and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK and/or PD study data for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the pre-specified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK and/or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include, but are not limited to, the scientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK and, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on productperformance.14 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.15 A final determination of the adequacy of the information will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 14: For a more complete discussion of the Agency\u2019s current thinking on issues related to bridging data to support use of a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies, see the guidance for industry Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.\n\nFootnote 15: Please refer to the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product.\n\nV Factors for Consideration in Assessing Whether Products Are Highly Similar\n\nWhen assessing whether products are highly similar, manufacturers should consider a number of factors, including the following:\n\nExpression System\n\nTherapeutic protein products can be produced in microbial cells (prokaryotic or eukaryotic), cell lines (e.g., mammalian, avian, insect, plant), or tissues derived from animals or plants. It is expected that the expression construct for a proposed product will encode the same primary amino acid sequence as its reference product. However, minor modifications, such as N- or C-terminal truncations (e.g., the heterogeneity of C-terminal lysine of a monoclonal antibody) that are not expected to change the product performance, may be justified and should be explained by the sponsor. Possible differences between the chosen expression system (i.e., host cell and the expression construct) of the proposed product and that of the reference product should be carefully considered because the type of expression system will affect the types of process- and product-related substances, impurities, and contaminants (including potential adventitious agents) that may be present in the protein product. For example, the expression system can have a significant effect on the types and extent of translational and posttranslational modifications that are imparted to the proposed product, which may introduce additional uncertainty into the demonstration that the proposed product is highly similar to the reference product.\n\nMinimizing differences between the proposed and reference expression systems to the extent possible can enhance the likelihood of producing a highly similar protein product. Use of different expression systems will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nManufacturing Process\n\nA comprehensive understanding of all steps in the manufacturing process for the proposed product should be established during product development. Characterization tests, process controls, and specifications that will emerge from information gained during process development must be specific for the proposed product and manufacturing process. The use of enhanced approaches 16 to pharmaceutical development, along with quality risk management and effective quality systems, will facilitate the consistent manufacturing of a high-quality product. As a scientific matter, as with 351(a) BLAs, a type II Drug Master File (DMF) for a drug substance, drug substance intermediate, or drug product would not be acceptable for a 351(k) application because a license holder is expected to have knowledge of and control over the manufacturing process for the biological product for which it has a license.17 Other types of contract manufacturing arrangements can be considered if the sponsor does not intend to manufacture the product for licensure.18\n\nFootnote 16: See the guidances for industry ICH Q8(R2), ICH Q9, ICH Q10, and ICH Q11 for guidance on enhanced approaches in manufacturing science.\n\nFootnote 17: A type II DMF may, however, be used to support an investigational new drug application (IND) for a biosimilar product. Assurance of product quality should be provided on each lot of material produced by the DMF holder. Procedures should also be in place to ensure that the IND sponsor is notified by the DMF holder of significant changes to the DMF potentially affecting product quality. The sponsor is expected to provide notification to the Agency of any relevant change in the IND in order to initiate a reevaluation of the DMF.\n\nA sponsor considering manufacturing changes after completing the initial analytical similarity assessment or after completing clinical studies intended to support a 351(k) application will need to demonstrate comparability between the pre- and post-change proposed product and may need to conduct additional analytical studies. The nature and extent of the changes may determine the extent of these additional similarity studies. The analytical similarity studies should include a sufficient number of lots of the proposed biosimilar product used in clinical studies as well as from the proposed commercial process if the process used to produce the material used in the clinical studies is different.\n\nAssessment of Physicochemical Properties\n\nPhysicochemical assessment of the proposed product and the reference product should consider all relevant characteristics of the protein product (e.g., the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure; posttranslational modifications; and functional activity(ies)). The objective of this assessment is to maximize the potential for detecting differences in quality attributes between the proposed product and the reference product.\n\nThe sponsor should address the concept of the desired product (and its variants) as discussed in ICH Q6B when designing and conducting the characterization studies. Thus, it will be important to understand the heterogeneity of the proposed product and the reference product (e.g., the nature, location, and levels of glycosylation) and the ranges of variability of different isoforms, including those that result from posttranslational modifications.\n\nParticular analytical methodologies can be used to assess specific physicochemical characteristics of proteins. These methodologies are described in published documents, including scientific literature, regulatory guidelines, and pharmacopeial compendia. Some techniques provide information on multiple characteristics. It is expected that appropriate analytical test methods will be selected based on the nature of the protein being characterized and knowledge regarding the structure and heterogeneity of the reference product and the proposed product, as well as those characteristics that are critical to product performance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.775482714176178", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product?

We update guidances periodically.

A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule \u201cRequirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products\u201d (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule \u201cContent and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling\u201d (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095\u201396).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7516794204711914", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in sections I and II of this guidance, the purpose of this guidance is to recommend a more efficient and flexible model to evaluate multiple versions of an investigational product that would otherwise be evaluated in separate clinical studies. For a single clinical study of different versions of an investigational product where each version is submitted in a separate IND, it may be challenging to determine how to structure and organize the INDs, and how to submit changes or new information as the study progresses. The framework described here is intended to provide clarity on these topics and, as feasible, to minimize submission of the same information to multiple INDs by facilitating cross-referencing to shared information in the INDs. Sponsors may discuss their specific clinical study and planned submission approach with OTAT, CBER prior to submitting an IND (e.g., by requesting an INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs (INTERACT)3 or pre-IND meeting4).\n\nFootnote 3: For additional information about INTERACT meetings, please see https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/interact-meetings.\n\nFootnote 4: See Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products, Draft Guidance for Industry, December 2017, https://www.fda.gov/media/109951/download. When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nOverview\n\nFor purposes of the framework outlined in this guidance, we refer to INDs either as \"Primary\" or \"Secondary\". The purpose of this nomenclature is to distinguish which INDs will include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Primary INDs) and which INDs will not include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Secondary INDs). For example, an IND amendment that contains only clinical information about the umbrella trial (e.g., no CMC or P/T information) would only need to be submitted to the Primary IND.\n\nFor a clinical study with two different versions of the investigational product (Product A and Product B), we recommend that the sponsor submit two separate INDs, IND A and IND B. One of the INDs, IND A, will be considered the \"Primary\" IND, and should include CMC and P/T information for Product A. IND B will be considered a \"Secondary\" IND, and will include CMC and P/T information for Product B. Primary IND A should also include complete clinical information for the umbrella\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nbetween the product versions may be submitted solely to the Primary IND and incorporated into the Secondary IND(s) by cross-reference.\n* In some cases, sponsors may decide to develop additional versions of a product after an IND has already been submitted. If the sponsor wishes to evaluate the original and additional versions of a product together in an umbrella trial, we recommend that sponsors submit an amendment to the existing IND specifying that it is a Primary IND and follow the steps in the section IV.B of this guidance to submit Secondary IND(s) and add arm(s) to the study.\n\nAppendix B Adding Arms to the Study\n\nIf the arm to be added includes a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy product, (e.g., Product C), we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nIND C with CMC and P/T information for Product C. IND C will be considered a Secondary IND. We recommend that the cover letter for a Secondary IND clearly state that the IND is a Secondary IND and specify the Primary IND number. The Secondary IND should cross-reference the Primary IND for clinical information.\n\nAn amendment to IND A with the updated clinical protocol, which now includes an arm for Product C. We recommend that the cover letter for the amendment to IND A clearly state that the IND is a Primary IND and specify the Secondary IND number(s), including IND C. We recommend that the Primary IND also be updated to include a cross-reference to the Secondary IND for CMC and P/T information related to Product C. It should be noted that the new Secondary IND C cannot go into effect until 30 days after FDA receives the new IND (21 CFR 312.40(b)(1)), unless FDA provides earlier notification that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin (21 CFR 312.40(b)(2)). Administration of Product C cannot begin until IND C goes into effect and IRB approval of the modified protocol has been granted (21 CFR 56.103).\n\nIf the arm to be added does not include a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy (e.g., a new arm that will study Product B in combination with a marketed product, or a new arm that will study investigational Products A and B together), then we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nAn amendment to the Primary IND with the updated clinical protocol (i.e., with the new arm); and\n\nAny additional P/T information supporting the new arm, if applicable, submitted to the relevant IND(s).\n\nSubmitting Other Types of Changes or New Information\n\nFor revisions to the umbrella trial clinical protocol that do not add a new arm or for other types of new clinical information, the sponsor should submit the revised protocol or new clinical information to the Primary IND. The sponsor does not need to submit any information to the Secondary INDs.\n\nFor new CMC or P/T information (e.g., changes to the CMC information, new P/T study report): if the new information is specific to one product (e.g., Product B), then that information should be submitted to IND B only. If the new information is for multiple products (e.g., Products A and B), then the new information should be submitted to INDs A and B (or submitted to IND A and cross-referenced by IND B, as mentioned previously). For new P/T information, the sponsor should also submit an updated investigator brochure to the Primary IND.\n\nClinical Holds and Responses to Hold\n\nIf only one arm (e.g., arm studying Product B) will be placed on hold, then the Primary IND would be placed on partial hold and the relevant Secondary IND would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate).\n\nIn the event that FDA issues an order placing the entire study on clinical hold (e.g., due to a safety issue that applies to all product versions), then all Primary and Secondary INDs would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate). 21 CFR 312.42(a).\n\nTo respond to a clinical hold, the sponsor will need to submit a response to each IND that was placed on hold. However, detailed information responding to each hold comment does not need to be submitted to multiple INDs. For example, if the Primary IND was placed on partial hold due to CMC concerns with a product in a Secondary IND, the sponsor should submit the CMC information responding to the hold comments to the Secondary IND. The response to hold for the Primary IND can refer to the Secondary IND for detailed information.\n\nReporting\n\nIND safety reporting must be performed in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.7 The sponsor must submit safety reports for an investigational product to all of the sponsor's INDs that are relevant to that product. At a minimum, safety reports must be submitted to both the Primary IND and any Secondary IND that contains the CMC and P/T information for that product. In cases where a safety report for one product is relevant to the safety of multiple related products, the safety report must be submitted to all of the relevant INDs (21 CFR 312.32(c)). The report submitted to the\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Studying Multiple Versions of a Cellular or Gene Therapy Product in an Early-Phase Clinical Trial Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9816510081291199", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 28: See section V on U.S.-licensed reference product and other comparators in the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015).\n\nFootnote 29: See Q.I.8 in the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (December 2018), which discusses use of a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product.\n\nAs described in section VI.A., a switching study is typically designed to assess whether switching between the reference product and the proposed interchangeable product will present risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy that is greater than using the reference product without such switching. A switching study should generally evaluate whether switching between the reference product and the proposed interchangeable product will affect clinical response in terms of safety or diminished efficacy reflected, in part, through an assessment of whether switching results in differences in immunogenicity and PK and/or PD (if available), as comparedto not switching. Hence, rather than being used only as a control, the comparator product is used in a switching study in both the active switching arm and the control non-switching arm. Therefore, the type and extent of bridging data needed to justify the use of a non-U.S.-licensed comparator in a switching study may be different or more extensive than is needed in other contexts.\n\nIt is possible that the reference product and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product have, for example, subtle differences in levels of specific structural features (e.g., acidic variants, deamidations), process related impurities, or formulation. These subtle differences may not preclude use of the non-U.S.-licensed product as a comparator in certain studies to support a demonstration of biosimilarity because the comparator is being used as a control in an evaluation that does not involve switching back and forth. However, in the context of switching between the products, multiple exposures to each product may potentially prime the immune system to recognize subtle differences in structural features between products. The overall immune response could be increased under these conditions. This immunologic response is highly dependent on the structural differences between the proposed interchangeable product and the comparator product used in the switching study, in addition to other potential differences between the products such as impurities and formulation.\n\nFor the reasons described above, the type and extent of data needed to justify the use of a non-U.S.-licensed comparator in a switching study may be different or more extensive than is needed in other contexts in which a non-U.S.-licensed comparator is used. However, FDA believes that when supported by adequate data and information, it may be reasonable to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator in a switching study. Sponsors are encouraged to contact FDA early in the product development process to discuss the design of a switching study, including any proposal to provide adequate scientific justification to support the use of data generated in a switching study using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to support a demonstration of interchangeability.\n\nVIII Considerations for Developing Presentations for Proposed Interchangeable Products\n\nThe data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability, beyond that needed to demonstrate biosimilarity,30 may also be influenced by the proposed product's presentation.31 Sponsors are encouraged to contact FDA early during product development to discuss the proposed presentation and specific considerations related to licensure of the proposed product as an interchangeable under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 30: Data and information needed to demonstrate biosimilarity are discussed in section VII of the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]\n\npostmarketing surveillance or studies.

Parametric release is defined as a sterility assurance release program where demonstrated control of the sterilization process enables a firm to use defined critical process controls, in lieu of the sterility test, to fulfill the intent of 21 CFR 211.165(a), and 211.167(a).5 Under this strategy, market release of terminally sterilized products can be based upon meeting the defined sterilization parameters and not on performing an approved sterility test. Meeting the requirements of the parametric release process can provide greater assurance that a batch meets the sterility requirement than can be achieved with a sterility test of finished units drawn from the batch.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 211.167(a) for drug products or 21 CFR 610.12 for biologic products. In addition, refer to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapters: (<)1(>) (Injections), (<)71(>) (Sterility), and (<)1041(>) (Biologicals). Short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, including positron emission tomography (PET) drugs, are subject to sterility testing; however, they may be released prior to completion of this test (21 CFR 211.165(a)).\n\nFootnote 5: For information on how current good manufacturing practices will be applied for products subject to parametric release that are within the scope of this guidance, see the FDA Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 460.800.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\n[150] Risk Assessment, Process Understanding, and Prior Knowledge\n\n[152] Successful parametric release systems are based on the reliability of the control strategy of the sterility assurance program. We recommend that your risk assessment focus on the risk of failure to achieve the minimum required probability of a non-sterile unit for each unit of every batch. The risk assessment should include the following:\n\n[153] Consistency of performance of the terminal sterilization cycle within the validated limits.\n\n[154] A discussion of risk to the sterility of the product relative to the following: (1) the production terminal sterilization cycle, (2) the production loading patterns, (3) the container closure system (including secondary packaging), and (4) any potential contamination risks from the environment (as appropriate). For an approved application, you should indicate any changes to the above items and provide an assessment of the risk to the sterility of the product associated with those changes. For example, although the established minimum sterilization time cannot be lowered, the maximum sterilization time can be increased if the appropriate stability data are provided to support the increase.\n\n[167] Experience with the proposed or similar product (and container closure system) and proposed or similar sterilization process, the overall risks to sterility, and the steps you have taken to assess and control these risks. For new products, prior knowledge from developmental and registration/exhibit batches may suffice.\n\n[168] A discussion of your overall prior knowledge and production and testing experience relevant to the drug product that will be subject to parametric release.\n\n[169] Documentation for Parametric Release Process\n\n[170] The following information specific to the proposed parametric release process should also be included in your submission:\n\n[171] A citation to a complete and detailed description of the current relevant terminal sterilization cycle.\n\n[172] Identification of the critical process parameters (process/cycle parameters and appropriate load monitors essential for product release) for the product(s) proposed for parametric release, including the minimum and maximum limits for these critical parameters. The critical process parameters should be within the limits that have been validated and approved for sterility assurance of the subject product(s).\n\n[173] **Acknowledgement that adherence to the critical parameters of the parametric release program will substitute for the performance of a sterility test as the primary release criterion for the product and that sterility test results from the finished product will not be used to overrule any failure to meet the acceptance criteria of the parametric release program. In the event of failure, the specific sterilizer load will be rejected by the quality control unit and will not be released unless there is a provision for reprocessing.\n\nAcknowledgement that regardless of the batch release technique used, any specimen tested according to the reference test method for sterility (e.g., compendium or FDA regulations) will meet the criteria for sterility (such as during testing for stability or postmarketing investigations).\n\nA description of the sterilization load monitor that indicates the following: (1) the type of monitor being proposed, (2) how the load monitor will be used and analyzed, (3) what functions are being measured by the monitor, and (4) the rationale for the location of the monitor. Additionally, for indirect monitors, we recommend that you include a statement justifying the classification of the indirect indicator that you are using as defined by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI 2008). In certain circumstances a Class 3 indicator may be appropriate; however, a Class 5 indicator is recommended for most situations.\n\nDocumentation of the control system to verify exposure of the load to the sterilization process.\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission of Documentation in Applications for Parametric Release of Human and Veterinary Drug Products Terminally Sterilized by Moist Heat Processes Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.319103240966797", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: orIndustry/UCM052487.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm xi}) CVM GFI #64: Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology (July 1999).\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/Guidancef\n\norIndustry/UCM052379.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm xi}) CVM GFI #93/VICH GL11(R): Impurities in New Veterinary Medicinal Products (Revised) (November 2007).\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/Guidancef\n\norIndustry/UCM052432.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm iii}) United States Pharmacopoeia Chapter (<)661(>)Containers-Plastics.

An electronic version of this guidance is also available via Internet via World Wide Web (WWW) (connect to the FDA Home Page at WWW.FDA.GOV/CDER and go to the \"Regulatory Guidance\" section).\n\nFOR THE SUBMISSION OF\n\nDOCUMENTATION FOR STERILIZATION PROCESS VALIDATION IN APPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN AND VETERINARY DRUG PRODUCTS\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Purpose\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for the submission of information and data in support of the efficacy of sterilization processes in drug applications for both human and veterinary drugs. The recommendations in the guidance apply to applications for sterile drug products (new drug applications, new animal drug applications, abbreviated new drug applications, abbreviated antibiotic applications, and abbreviated new animal drug applications). These recommendations also apply to previously approved applications when supplements associated with the sterile processing of approved drugs are submitted. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may also be necessary in investigational new drug and investigational new animal drug applications.\n\nIn the FEDERAL REGISTER of October 11, 1991 (56 FR 51354), the agency published a proposed rule entitled \"Use of Aseptic Processing and Terminal Sterilization in the Preparation of Sterile Pharmaceuticalsfor Human and Veterinary Use.\" This guidance is not a substitution for or a supplement to that proposed rule. Regardless of whether the applicant uses terminal sterilization or aseptic processing to manufacture a drug product that is purported to be sterile, certain information about the validation of that process should be submitted for both of those types of sterilization.\n\nAppendix B Documenting Sterilization Process Validation\n\nThe efficacy of a given sterilization process for a specific drug product is evaluated on the basis of a series of protocols and scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that the sterilization process and associated control procedures can reproducibly deliver a sterile product. Data derived from experiments and control procedures allow conclusions to be drawn about the probability of nonsterile product units (sterility assurance level). Based on the scientific validity of the protocols and methods, as well as on the scientific validity of the results and conclusions, the agency concludes that the efficacy of the sterilization process is validated.\n\nWhether a drug product is sterilized by a terminal sterilization process or by an aseptic filling process, the efficacy of the sterilization process may be validated without the manufacture of three production batches.\n\nSterilization process validation data, however, should be generated using procedures and conditions that are fully representative and descriptive of the procedures and conditions proposed for manufacture of the product in the application.\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER's) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM's) review of the validation of the sterilization process consists of a scientific evaluation of the studies submitted in the applications. This review is conducted by FDA's review staff, and is part of a cooperative effort between the review staff, compliance staff, and field investigators to ensure the overall state of control of the sterile processing of human and veterinary drug products. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may be provided directly to the application or by specific reference to a drug master file (DMF), a veterinary master file (VMF), or another application. Letters of authorization to refer to the referenced files should be included.\n\nAppendix C Remarks\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide recommendations for the types of information applicants should include in human and animal drug applications.

Identify the autoclave(s) to be used for production sterilization, including manufacturer and model.\n4. Autoclave Loading Patterns A description of representative autoclave loading patterns should be provided.\n5. Methods and Controls to Monitor Production Cycles Methods and controls used to monitor routine production cycles (e.g., thermocouples, pilot bottles, and biological indicators) should be described, including the number and location of each as well as acceptance and rejection specifications.\n6. Requalification of Production Autoclaves A description of the program for routine and unscheduled requalification of production autoclaves, including frequency, should be provided.\n7. Reprocessing A description and validation summary of any program that provides for reprocessing (e.g., additional thermal processing) of product should be provided. Please note that the stability program is also affected by additional thermal processing. For further information concerning the stability program, reference is made to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research \"Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics\" and to the Center for Veterinary Medicine \"Drug Stability Guideline.\"\n8. Thermal Qualification of the Cycle\n9. Heat Distribution and Penetration Studies Heat distribution and penetration study protocols and data summaries that demonstrate the uniformity, reproducibility, and conformance to specifications of the production sterilization cycle should be provided. Results from a minimum of three consecutive, successful cycles should be provided to ensure that the results are consistent and meaningful.\n2. Thermal Monitors The number of thermal monitors used and their location in the chamber should be described. A diagram is helpful.\n3. The Effects of Loading on Thermal Input Data should be generated with minimum and maximum load to demonstrate the effects of loading on thermal input to product. Additional studies may be necessary if different fill volumes are used in the same container line. Data summaries are acceptable for these purposes. A summary should consist of, for example, high and low temperatures (range), average temperature during the dwell period, minimum and maximum (F_{0}) values, dwell time, run date and time, and identification of the autoclave(s) used. These data should have been generated from studies carried out in production autoclave(s) that will be used for sterilization of the product that is the subject of the application.\n4. Information Included in the Batch Record The batch record supplied with the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the application should identify the validated processes to be used for sterilization and for depyrogenation of any container-closure components. This information can be included in the batch record by reference to the validation protocol or standard operating procedure (SOP). Validation information should be provided as described above.\n\nMicrobiological Efficacy of the Cycle Validation studies that demonstrate the efficacy (Iethality) of the production cycle should be provided. A sterility assurance of 10-6 or better should be demonstrated for any terminal sterilization process. This level of sterility assurance should be demonstrated for all parts of the drug product (including the container and closure, if applicable), which are claimed to be sterile. The specific type of study and the methods used to carry out the study (or studies) are product and process specific and may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. In general, the following types of information and data should be provided.\n\nIdentification and Characterization of Bioburden Organisms Describe the methods and results from studies used to identify and characterize bioburden organisms. The amount and type of information supplied may be dependent on the validation strategy chosen. For example, more information may be needed for bioburden-based autoclave processes than for overkill processes. Information concerning the number, type, and resistance of bioburden organisms may be necessary, including those organisms associated with the product solution and the container and closure. It may be necessary to identify the most heat-resistant bioburden organisms.\n\nSpecifications for Bioburden Specifications (alert and action levels) for bioburden should be provided. A description should be included of the program for routinely monitoring bioburden to ensure that validated and established limits are not exceeded (e.g., frequency of analysis and methods used in bioburden screening). The methods provided should be specific.\n\nIdentification, Resistance, and Stability of Biological Indicators Information and data concerning the identification, resistance (D and Z values), and stability of biological indicators used in the biological validation of the cycle should be provided. If biological indicators are purchased from a commercial source, it may be necessary to corroborate the microbial count and resistance, and provide performance specifications.\n\nThe Resistance of the Biological Indicator Relative to That of Bioburden Studies characterizing the resistance of the biological indicator relative to that of bioburden may be necessary. Resistance in or on the product (i.e., in the product solution, or on the surface of container or closure parts or interfaces) should be determined as necessary. If spore carriers are used (e.g., spore strips), the resistance of spores on the carrier relative to that of directly inoculated product should be determined, if necessary.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]\n\nunits that have been exposed to the maximum sterilization cycle(s). If a product is exposed to more than one process, then exposure to the maximum cycle of all processes should be incorporated into the study design.\n3. Multiple Barriers Each barrier that separates areas of the drug product claimed to be sterile should be separately evaluated and validated.\n4. The Sensitivity of the Test The sensitivity of the experimental method used for container-closure integrity testing should be specified and provided.\n5. Integrity Over the Product Shelf Life Microbial integrity of the container-closure system should be demonstrated over the shelf life of the product. (See section V.A. of this guidance.)\n\nF. Bacterial Endotoxins Test and Method The bacterial endotoxins test used for the product should be described. The description should include qualification of the laboratory, inhibition and enhancement testing and results, determination of noninhibitory concentration and maximum valid dilution. For further information see the agency guidance entitled \"Guideline on Validation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test As An End-Product Endotoxin Test for Human And Animal Parenteral Drugs, Biological Products, and Medical Devices.\"\n6. Sterility Testing Methods and Release Criteria Sterility test methods should be described and should include the protocol for the selection of representative units during production. When test methods differ significantly from compendial test methods, a demonstration of the equivalency to the compendial method should be provided. Testing performed within barrier systems should be described, and information concerning validation of the barrier system may be necessary.\n\nH. Evidence of Formal, Written ProceduresSection 211.113(b) of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that written procedures, designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, be established and followed. Such procedures should include validation of any sterilization process. Therefore, evidence should be provided that there are formal, written procedures describing the elements listed above and that these procedures are followed. Such evidence may consist of SOP's, listing of SOP's, and protocols submitted as part of these elements.\n\n3 Other Terminal Sterilization Processes\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.4998397827148438", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: #156\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nComparability Protocols -\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and\n\nControls Information\n\nfor New Animal Drugs\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.4342519044876099", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: Recommendations for executed (completed) batch records are provided in CVM guidance for industry [42]: Animal Drug Manufacturing Guidelines-Series of Four Guidelines (1994). CVM encourages the submission of executed batch records for lots of drug substance and drug product used in support of the application as they provide valuable detail and insight into the manufacturing process and proposed controls.\n\na.1.1 Pharmaceutical Development Reports\n\nSponsors are encouraged to provide pharmaceutical development reports (PDRs) that describe the scientific rationale for the chosen manufacturing process(es) and controls for fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and related drug products. A sponsor's ability to demonstrate process understanding can be factored into CVM's risk-based decision making (e.g., Pre-Approval Inspection Decision Support System (PAIDSS)). Suggestions for PDRs can be found in ICH Q8: Pharmaceutical Development.\n\na.1.2 Cell Growth (Propagation) and Harvest\n\nA description should be provided that includes a flow diagram illustrating each step in propagation from the original inoculum (e.g., cells from one or more vials of the working cell bank) through the last harvesting operation.\n\nAll steps should be included along with the relevant information, such as the growth conditions and in-process tests performed (e.g., cell concentrations, volumes, pH, cultivation times, temperatures).\n\nCritical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with sampling plans and testing time points.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe flow diagram can be supplemented with information presented in tabular form, if appropriate.\n\nA narrative describing each manufacturing step in the process should accompany the flow diagram:\n\nIdentify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria\n\nHighlight any process controls that are considered critical\n\nIdentify the intended scale of the process. The amounts indicated should be representative of a maximum-sized production batch.\n\nWe recommend the following be included in the narrative:\n\nA description of the major equipment involved in each step\n\nA description of inoculation and each step in propagation with growth conditions specified\n\nThe composition of the media used at each step, including water quality and additives used\n\nThe sterilization procedures for media (e.g. a batch sterilization process or continuous system)\n\nThe equipment (e.g. fermentation vessel), feeds, and other materials added during the fermentation process\n\nProcess parameters monitored and controls for critical steps and intermediates\n\nProcedures used to transfer material between steps\n\nProcedures used to minimize contamination by adventitious agents\n\nProcess controls to confirm the effectiveness of the specific manufacturing steps used to inactivate and or remove adventitious agents\n\nCriteria for harvesting\n\nCriteria for rejecting/accepting a fermentation batch if contamination occurs\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nCriteria for pooling more than one harvest, if applicable\n\nStorage conditions and time limits if the harvested crude fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n3. Purification and Downstream Processing\n\nThe description should include a flow diagram that illustrates and a narrative that describes all the steps involved in isolating and purifying the crude fermentation product to its final form, along with any relevant information (e.g., volumes, pH, temperatures, holding times). Critical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with testing time points.\n\nThe narrative describing each manufacturing step should accompany the flow diagram and should identify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria and include the following:\n\nMethods used in purification or separation of the crude fermentation product (e.g. precipitation, centrifugation, filtration) including major equipment (e.g. columns, membranes* Process parameters monitored\n\nThe in-process controls and analytical tests used to show identity, purity, and concentration and to evaluate levels of process- and product-related impurities\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nPrecautions taken to prevent or control microbial contamination during purification\n\nConditions for reuse and/or procedures for regeneration of columns, membranes, and adsorbents\n\nStorage conditions and time limits, if the purified fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n4. Modification Reactions (If Applicable)\n\nChemical Modifications\n\nWhen a product of fermentation is to be subjected to further molecular change through chemical means, a description of the synthetic steps should be included in the procedural narrative.\n\nAdditionally, a flow diagram of the synthetic process should be provided. For more details, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nEnzymatic Modifications\n\nWhen the fermentation product is further modified using enzyme catalysts, the steps should be included in the flow diagram and detailed in the procedural narrative. Enzymatic reactions are considered chemical reactions since the conversion of substrate product involves breaking and forming chemical bonds. Thus, much of the information submitted in the manufacturing description should be the same as that submitted for chemical processes (drug substance).\n\nHowever, because enzymatic functionality requires carefully controlled conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, osmolarity), the description should contain detailed information on reaction controls and the optimum range of operation. Furthermore, the biological source of the enzyme should be provided along with a description of the enzyme's preparation and information about its purity.\n\n5. Reprocessing, Reworking, Recycling, Regeneration, and Salvaging\n\nWhen appropriate, reprocessing, reworking, recycling, regeneration, and salvaging operations should be described. For more detail, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nAppendix C Control of Materials\n\nA list of materials used in the manufacture of fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and drug products should be provided (i.e., the microorganism, cell bank system, media components, solvents, reagents, auxiliary materials). Information pertaining to the quality and control of these materials should also be provided.\n\n1. _Microorganism_Information about the microorganism used for production (i.e., genus, species, and type strain) and known genotypic and phenotypic characteristics should be provided. Additionally, the origin of the source material (or isolate) should be identified or described.\n\n2. Cell Bank System a. Master Cell Bank\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to generate the master cell bank (MCB) and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. The information should include:\n\nMethod, reagents, and media used in preparation\n\nDate of preparation\n\nProcess controls\n\nStorage conditions\n\nProcedures used in testing for relevant phenotypic and genotypic markers and determining culture purity\n\nProcedures used to ensure the absence of contamination from adventitious agents (e.g., microbial contamination and cross-contamination by other cell types) with tests and acceptance criteria specified\n\nb. Working Cell Bank\n\nPreservation of the microbial purity of the MCB is an important factor in maintaining the production strain. Often a working cell bank (WCB) is created so that the MCB will be less likely to be compromised. Creation of a WCB occurs via the propagation of the MCB through defined culture conditions, and then aliquots of the resultant homogenous culture suspension are partitioned into individual storage containers of appropriate size for routine production purposes.\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to derive a WCB from the MCB and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. Information similar to that submitted for the MCB should also be submitted for the WCB.\n\n3. Media Components\n\nA list of the media components used at each stage of the fermentation process should be included in the submission. Specifications should be provided for each component for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose.\n\nIf ruminant-based media components are used in the fermentation process, they should comply with the proposed BSE Medical Products Rule, issued on January 12, 2007 (72 FR 1582).\n\nAll animal-derived components should be identified and appropriate mitigation steps taken to prevent the transmission of adventitious agents.\n\n4. Solvents, Reagents, Auxiliary Materials\n\nA list of solvents, reagents, and other auxiliary materials used in the fermentation process should be provided. Specifications for each material should be included for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose. When water is used in the process, it should be of an appropriate quality for its intended use.\n\nControl of Critical Steps and Intermediates\n\nAll critical process controls and their associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria should be identified and justified and a brief description of the test provided. Furthermore, any experimental data to support the justification should be included.\n\nGood controls are essential during fermentation to ensure product consistency.\n\nEnd product testing alone is not adequate for demonstrating a fermentation process is under control.\n\nManufacturing processes, including fermentation, should be controlled to ensure that the product meets previously identified quality attributes.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #216 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Information - Fermentation-Derived Intermediates, Drug Substances, and Related Drug Products for Veterinary Medicinal Use \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6797458529472351"], "As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.1 Premarket Approval Applications (PMA)\n\nPMA approval is required by FDA before devices that are class III25 can be legally marketed.26 PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to reasonably assure that the device or device-led combination product is safe and effective for its intended use(s).27 Sponsors should ensure that PMA applications for device-led combination products contain sufficient data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the combination product as a whole, including data regarding all constituent part(s). The PMA includes sections containing, among other things, technical data, non-clinical laboratory studies, and clinical investigations.28 Before approving or denying a PMA, the appropriate FDA advisory committee29 may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether FDA should approve the submission.30\n\nFootnote 25: Class III devices are devices (1) for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls and special controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and (2) which are purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury (see section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act).\n\n2.2.2 De Novo Classification Requests\n\nDevices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified or reclassified based on the criteria in section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act are automatically classified into class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, and may be classified into class I or class II under the De Novo classification process.\n\nIf a sponsor believes its product is appropriate for classification into class I31 or class II,32 it may submit a request for De Novo classification.33 If the sponsor demonstrates that the criteria in section 513(a)(1)(A) or (B) of the FD&C Act are met, FDA grants the request for De Novo classification and issues a written order classifying the specific product and product type in class I or class II. If the product is classified as class II, it is granted marketing authorization subject to general controls, as well as identified special controls which provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.34 Such a product may serve as a legally marketed (predicate)35 product for future 510(k) submissions. If the product cannot be classified as class I or II, the De Novo request is declined and the product remains in class III and subject to PMA approval.\n\nFootnote 31: Class I products are subject to a set of regulatory authorities called general controls (see section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). General controls include, but are not limited to, provisions that relate to establishment registration and listing, premarket notification, prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding, records and reports, and good manufacturing practices.\n\nFootnote 32: Class II products are products for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the product, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls necessary to provide such assurance (see section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Special controls are product type-specific and may include promulgation of performance standards, requirements for postmarket surveillance, patient registries, labeling, and performance testing and clinical/non-clinical data.\n\nFootnote 33: See section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 860, subpart D (86 FR 54826, October 5, 2021). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation)(October 2021).\n\nFootnote 34: Such special controls will generally be established through consultation and alignment with the non-lead center.\n\nFootnote 35: A legally marketed (predicate) device to which a new device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I, or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process (see 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)).\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nFootnote 37: See section 513(f)(2)(A)(ii) and (iv) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 38: For example, blood, gene therapies, or human cellular or tissue products.\n\nSpecial controls set forth criteria for class II products that are necessary to provide the assurance of safety and effectiveness to justify classification in class II. To be class II by being within the same type as the product that was the subject of the De Novo, future products must be found substantially equivalent and comply with general controls and applicable special controls for the product type; a failure to comply with special controls will cause the product to be class III and subject to PMA approval.36\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nA sponsor may request De Novo classification without submitting a 510(k) first; FDA may decline to undertake such request if FDA identifies a predicate product that could provide a reasonable basis for review of substantial equivalence, or if FDA determines either that the product submitted is not of low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls to mitigate the risks cannot be developed.37 Among other considerations, understanding of the biological product or drug constituent parts, including limitations of such understanding, need to be considered when determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway for such device-led combination products. Because certain products present unique concerns (such as, for certain biological products,38 considerations associated with infectious disease transmission and challenges associated with ensuring reproducibility of such biological products), management of such concerns should be considered in determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway.\n\nSee annex for illustrative examples on how these principles can be applied.\n\niii.1.3 Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions\n\nThe 510(k) review standard (substantial equivalence of a new product to a predicate product) differs from the PMA and De Novo review standards. The 510(k) review standard is comparative, whereas the PMA and De Novo review standards rely on an independent demonstration of safety and effectiveness. Nonetheless, the principles of safety and effectiveness underlie the substantial equivalence determination in every 510(k) review.\n\nThe standard for a determination of substantial equivalence in a 510(k) review is set out in section 513(i) of the FD&C Act. A product is substantially equivalent to a predicate product if it:\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product; and\n\nhas the same technological characteristics as the predicate product;\n\nor\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product;\n\nhas different technological characteristics39; and\n\nthe information submitted to FDA, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary, demonstrates that the product:\n\nFootnote 39: Different technological characteristics are defined as \u201csignificant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features\u201d from the predicate. Section 513(i)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.100(b)(2)(ii)(A).\n\ndoes not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product; and\n\ndemonstrates that the product is as safe and effective as the predicate product.40\n\nFootnote 40: See section 513(i)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 807.100(b). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n\nFDA considers the product's relative safety and effectiveness in the substantial equivalence determination, and safety and effectiveness considerations are also critical to the Agency's evaluation of compliance with any applicable special controls, all of which FDA has determined to be necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product type.\n\nThe following products cannot be cleared in a 510(k) submission:\n\nProduct with a new intended use as compared to the predicate product\n\nProduct with different technological characteristics than the predicate product if such differences raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product.41\n\nFootnote 41: Ibid.\n\nGenerally, a device that is not combined with a drug or biological product constituent part could not be successfully used as a predicate for a 510(k) for a device-led combination product. This is because the addition of the drug or biological product constituent part would likely result in a new intended use and/or constitute a different technological characteristic that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate. In addition, a product with a different active ingredient from a predicate would differ significantly in features such as design and materials, which would likely raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as well.42\n\nFootnote 42: In certain instances, it may be possible for special controls to specify multiple specific active ingredients or an active ingredient class, provided general and special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8952479362487793", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnnual Reports for Approved\n\nPremarket Approval Applications\n\n(PMA)\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food\n\nand Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on December 16, 2019.\n\nDocument originally issued on February 10, 2014.\n\nFor questions regarding the use or interpretation of this guidance document in the review of annual reports for premarket approval applications (PMA), please contact ORP: Office of Regulatory Programs/Division of Regulatory Programs 1: Submission Support at 301-796-5640.\n\nFor questions regarding the application of this guidance to devices regulated by the Center for\n\nBiologicals Evaluation and Research (CBER), contact CBER's Office of Communication, Outreach\n\nand Development (OCOD) at 1-800- 835-4709 or 240-402-8010, or by email at occod@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nYou may submit electronic comments and suggestions at any time for Agency consideration to http://www.regulations.gov.

FDA believes that data and information gathered in the postmarket setting are critical to our continued confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the marketed device. Annual reports are one of the important tools that FDA relies on to gather information about the device in its post-approval setting.\n\nAnnual reports contain a variety of information, including information about manufacturing changes, design changes, and labeling changes that were made during the preceding year for the PMA product. This guidance recommends that this and other information be analyzed and presented in annual reports in a way that will be most useful to both the applicant and FDA. For example, the guidance recommends that the applicant describe in detail the rationale for changes made to the device, including, for example, whether the changes were the result of device improvement/enhancement, product complaints, or adverse events. This explanation will give FDA a more complete picture of the post-market safety profile of the device. The guidance also recommends that the applicant include a summary of all changes that were made to the device during the reporting period, including listing all supplements submitted during the reporting period and, if approved, their approval date. Having the information submitted in this way will help ensure that limited Agency resources are devoted to assessing meaningful information rather than requiring FDA to sift through vast amounts of data that have not been systematically reviewed by the firm.\n\nAnnual reports that contain clear descriptions and meaningful information are an important tool for the Agency and the industry to assure postmarket safety and protect the public. When applicants prepare and provide to FDA in annual reports the type of analysis this guidance describes, industry and FDA are better positioned to recognize and address possible safety issues.\n\nRegulatory Background\n\nIn PMA approval orders, FDA requires that PMA applicants submit post-approval periodic reports (e.g., annual reports at intervals of 1 year (unless otherwise specified) from the date of approval of the original PMA) to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 814.82(a)(7) and 814.84(b). Section 814.84(b) describes the information required to be included in periodic reports.\n\nUnless FDA specifies otherwise, a periodic report must:\n\nIdentify changes described in 21 CFR 814.39(a) and changes required to be reported to FDA under 21 CFR 814.39(b); and\n\nContain a summary and bibliography of the following information not previously submitted as part of the PMA:1. Unpublished reports of data from any clinical investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies involving the device or related devices and known to or that reasonably should be known to the applicant. ii. Reports in the scientific literature concerning the device and known to or that reasonably should be known to the applicant.\n\nIf, after reviewing the summary and bibliography, FDA concludes that the Agency needs a copy of the unpublished or published reports, FDA will notify the applicant that copies of such reports shall be submitted.\n\nThe PMA applicant is primarily responsible for determining whether changes to the device design, labeling, or manufacturing processes impact safety or effectiveness and, thus, require a PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice. This guidance is not intended to define when a PMA applicant should submit a new original PMA or any type of PMA Supplement. For that type of guidance, please refer to the FDA guidance, \"Modifications to Devices Subject to\n\nPremarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process.\"1\n\nFootnote 1: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process\n\nPMA applicants are also subject to other reporting requirements. In accordance with 21 CFR 814.84(a), the applicant must comply with Medical Device Reporting (MDR) requirements, 21 CFR Part 803, and any applicable requirements in other regulations or by order approving the device, including Post-Approval Study Reports if FDA has imposed continuing evaluation (post-approval study) requirements on the device in the PMA approval order, 21 CFR 814.82(a)(2).\n\nFDA believes that the types of information described in this guidance and the types of review, summary, and analyses we are recommending should be readily available to applicants because they currently collect this information and conduct these analyses as part of their compliance with the quality system regulations (21 CFR Part 820). For example, design controls already require the type of look back and assessment that we are suggesting be part of the annual report (21 CFR 820.30).\n\nIII. Scope\n\nIn the PMA approval orders, we typically specify that PMA applicants submit a report one (1) year from the date of approval of the original PMA and annually thereafter. Therefore, the periodic report is usually referred to as an \"annual report.\" There may be circumstances, however, where FDA specifies more frequent periodic reports that provide all of the same information that is reported annually. This guidance addresses FDA's expectations concerning annual and other periodic reports. This guidance addresses but does not describe in detail Post-Approval Study reports (see Section VI).\n\nIV Contents of an Annual Report\n\nA complete annual report (in an acceptable eCopy format)2 should include all of the information described below. The eCopy must be accompanied by a single paper copy of your signed cover letter.\n\nFootnote 2: Please refer to the FDA guidance, \u201ceCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions\u201d (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-device-submissions), for additional information on the eCopy program.\n\nCover Letter for an Annual Report\n\nFDA recommends that the applicant include a cover letter for the PMA annual report. The cover letter should include:\n\nPMA Number\n\nDevice Name (including device family name or model names and numbers)\n\nCompany Name\n\nDate of Report\n\nReporting Period (i.e., the dates the reporting period begins and ends)\n\nIdentification of the Changes Made During the Reporting Period\n\nFor changes that are the subject of an approved or pending PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice submitted in the reporting year, we recommend that the applicant identify the document number assigned by FDA and status of the document (e.g., approved with approval date, or pending).\n\nCertain changes related to the device documentation or manufacturing process documentation, such as rewording for clarification, translating from one language to another, correcting typographical errors, and moving component characteristics from a notation in an engineering drawing to a different document, such as an Standard Operating Procedure, generally do not need to be reported in the annual report (21 CFR 814.39(b)). In general, such changes do not affect the design, performance, labeling, or processing of the device, and affect only how the characteristics are documented. These types of changes have been commonly referred to as \"document to file\" by industry and should be kept in your design history file.\n\nFor each change that was identified as an annual reportable change that did not require a PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice under 21 CFR 814.39(b), we recommend you identify the following, as applicable:\n\ndescription of the change made, including a comparison to the previously approved version;\n--------------------\nContext title: Annual Reports for Approved Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.31024810671806335", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA\n\nStaff\n\nPremarket Approval Application\n\nModular Review\n\nDocument issued on: November 3, 2003\n\nThis document supersedes and replaces, \"A Modular Approach to PMA Review,\" dated January 29, 1998, and \"Guidance for the Medical Device Industry on PMA Shell Development and Modular Review,\" dated November 6, 1998.\n\nFor questions regarding this document, contact Thinh Nguyen (CDRH) at 240-276-4010 or by e-mail at thinh.nguyen@fda.hhs.gov.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nAppendix I Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide industry and FDA staff with information regarding the premarket approval application (PMA) modular review program and to outline the procedures for submitting or reviewing a modular PMA.\n\nThis guidance supersedes and replaces the documents entitled, \"A Modular Approach to PMA Review,\" dated January 29, 1998, and \"Guidance for the Medical Device Industry on PMA Shell Development and Modular Review,\" issued on November 6, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the 1998 Guidances).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nAppendix II Background\n\nIn a traditional PMA, the applicant submits all PMA data, as outlined in 21 CFR 814.20, at the same time, regardless of when testing is completed. FDA begins its review only upon receipt of all the required information In 1998, however, as part of CDRH's reengineering effort, FDA issued the above mentioned guidances. In these documents, FDA described a new policy whereby applicants could submit \"Modular PMAs.\" The goal of FDA's 1998 Guidances was to increase the efficiency of the PMA review process by allowing applicants to submit discrete sections (modules) of the PMA to FDA for review soon after completing the testing and analysis.\n\nFDA intends the modular review approach to provide a mechanism by which applicants may submit preclinical data and manufacturing information for review while still collecting, compiling, and analyzing the clinical data. Therefore, a modular PMA is a compilation of sections or \"modules\" submitted at different times that together become a complete application. Additionally, the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any deficiencies noted by FDA earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional PMA application.\n\nOn October 26, 2003, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUMFA), Pub lic Law 107-250 was enacted. Section 209 of MDUFMA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the act) to codify the modular review approach.1 In recognition that the agency would need to issue updated guidance to reflect the new statutory provision n, FDA requested comments on its modular PMA review program. On February 4, 2003, FDA published a Federal Register notice entitled, \"Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Establishment of a Public Docket (68 FR 5643)(hereinafter referred to as the MDUFMA Docket). In addition, FDA issued a guidance entitled, \"Assessing User Fees: PMA Supplement Definitions, Modular PMA Fees, BLA and Efficacy Supplement Definitions, Bundling Multiple Devices in a Single Application, and Fees for Combination Products.\"2 In the guidance, FDA asked for comments on the various topics discussed in the document, including modular review of PMAs.\n\nFootnote 1: Section 515(c) of the act, as amended by section 209 of MDUFMA.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance was issued on February 25, 2003 and can be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/1201.html (hereinafter referred to as the Assessing User Fees guidance.)\n\nSince 1998, FDA has gained considerable experience with modular PMA submissions. Based on FDA's experience prior to the enactment of MDUFMA and comments submitted to the MDUFMA Docket, FDA is issuing this guidance to replace the 1998 Guidances. These changes include:\n\nclarifying that modular review should be limited to original PMAs (i.e., modular review is not ordinarily appropriate for PMA supplements)\n\nmodifying the procedures for preparing and submitting a modular PMA\n\nexplaining the significance of timing for submission of the modules\n\nrevising the sample shell and specifying the expected content of the modules\n\nsuggesting limitations to the total number of modules that should be submitted.\n\nThe agency expects these changes to: 1) help clarify which PMAs are appropriate for modular review, 2) simplify submission procedures, and 3) improve the efficiency of FDA's review. Additionally, we have added guidance addressing user fee payment procedures for modular PMAs.\n\nThe Least Burdensome Approach\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarket Approval Application Modular Review Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.24974533915519714", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA and Industry Actions on\n\nPremarket Approval Applications\n\n(PMAs): Effect on FDA Review\n\nClock and Goals\n\nGuidance for Industry and\n\nFood and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on October 3, 2022.\n\nDocument originally issued on October 8, 2003.\n\nThis document supersedes FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs): Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals\n\nissued October 2, 2017.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Regulatory Programs/Division of Submission Support/PMA, HDE, Q-Submission, and Device Tracking Lifecycle Team at 301-796-5640, or by email at\n\n(\\underline{\\text{\\small{OPEQSubmissionSupport}}})_a_fda.hhs.gov.

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 20221 (MDUFA V), amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) to authorize FDA to collect user fees for the review of certain premarket submissions received on or after October 1, 2022, including premarket approval applications (PMAs). The additional funds obtained from user fees will enable FDA, with the cooperation of industry, to improve the device review process to meet certain performance goals and implement improvements for the medical device review process.\n\nFootnote 1: See Title II of the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-180).\n\nPerformance goals were negotiated and agreed to under MDUFA V for PMAs received in FY 2023-2027. These performance goals and process improvements are outlined in the letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Congress2 (MDUFA V Commitment Letter) and are further described below.\n\nFootnote 2: See 168 CONG. REC. S5194-S5203 (daily ed. September 28, 2022) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization). The MDUFA V Commitment Letter is also available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/158308/download.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThis guidance document describes:\n\nthe different FDA actions that may be taken on premarket approval applications (PMAs);\n\n2027); and\n\nthe different industry actions that may be taken on PMAs.\n\nIII. FDA Actions\n\nThe PMA regulation outlines the various actions FDA may take on an original PMA or PMA supplement during the course of our review.3 For original PMAs, panel-track supplements, and 180-day supplements,4 the following responses are considered FDA actions:\n\nFootnote 3: See 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart C.\n\nFootnote 4: For more detailed information, see FDA\u2019s guidance document, \u201cUser Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and Device Biologics Licences Applications,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/user-fees-and-refunds-premarket-approval-applications-and-device-biologics-license-applications or the guidance document entitled, \u201cModifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process.\n\napproval order;\n\napprovable letter;\n\nmajor deficiency letter;\n\nnot approvable letter; and\n\ndenial order.\n\nFor real-time supplements, all of the above responses apply with the exception of a major deficiency letter.\n\nFurthermore, of these FDA actions, all but a major deficiency letter are a \"MDUFA decision\" under FDA's commitment letters and are measured against a MDUFA IV/V goal. These FDA actions are described below.\n\nAppendix A Approval Order\n\nFDA will issue an approval order (letter) informing the applicant that the PMA is approved and that the applicant may begin commercial distribution of the device in accordance with any prescribed conditions of approval after we have completed our review and:\n\nnone of the reasons listed in 21 CFR 814.45 for denying approval applies;\n\nthere is reasonable assurance the device is safe and effective (using the criteria provided in 21 CFR 860.7) for its intended use as prescribed in the product labeling; and\n\nthe device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls were found to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation (21 CFR Part 820).\n\nAn approval order shuts off the review clock, marks the end of FDA review, and is considered a final action.\n\nAppendix B Approvable Letter\n\nFDA will issue an approvable letter informing the applicant that we have completed our review of the application and determined that there needs to be:\n\nresolution of minor deficiencies,5 which are identified in the approvable letter (21CFR 814.44(e)); and/or Footnote 5: Minor deficiencies may include, for example, clarifications of previously submitted information, revisions to the labeling, and revisions/development of a post approval study protocol.\n\ncompletion of an FDA inspection that finds the manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls in compliance with the Quality System (QS) regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, and, if applicable, verifies records pertinent to the PMA as per 21 CFR 814.44(e)(1)(iii). When this is the case, the approvable letter states that the device is \"approvable pending GMP inspection.\"\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable letter pending resolution of minor deficiencies, we stop the review clock and place the application on hold. When FDA receives a complete response to an approvable letter, we will resume the clock with a new FDA response timeframe to reach a final decision. FDA will issue a decision within 60 calendar days of the sponsor's response to the approvable letter, as resources permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative review timelines and statutory obligations.\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable pending GMP inspection letter, we stop the review clock. Once FDA determines that the device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls arefound to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation, 21 CFR part 820, we will issue an approval order.\n\nAppendix C Major Deficiency Letter\n\nFDA will issue a major deficiency letter6 informing the applicant that the PMA lacks significant information necessary for FDA to complete our review and requests the applicant to amend the application to provide the necessary information regarding the device (21 CFR 814.37(b)), such as:\n\nFootnote 6: For additional information about deficiencies, see FDA\u2019s guidance document, \u201cDeveloping and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/developing-and-responding-deficiencies-accordance-least-burdensome-provisions.\n\na detailed re-analysis of previously submitted data (e.g., alternative statistical method);\n\nadditional test data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the device (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, biocompatibility, reliability, software, labeling, animal testing, sensitivity and specificity in a certain population);\n\nscientific rationale for test data critical to determining reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device provided in the submission; or\n\nnew validation data and analyses (e.g., due to device modifications made during the course of the PMA review).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs)- Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4345400631427765", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: In requesting additional information with respect to a premarket approval application (PMA), \"the Secretary shall consider the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.\"6 Footnote 5: Section 515(c)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\n\"[T]he Secretary shall consider the role of postmarket information in determining the least burdensome means of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.\"7 Footnote 7: Section 515(c)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe term \"necessary\" in the least burdensome provisions means the \"minimum required information\" that would support a determination of substantial equivalence or a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.8 Footnote 8: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iii), 513(i)(1)(D)(ii), and 515(c)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe least burdensome provisions do not change the standards for premarket approval or substantial equivalence.9 Footnote 9: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iv), 513(i)(1)(D)(iii), and 515(c)(5)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA issued least burdensome guidance documents after the enactment of FDAMA. \"Suggested Format for Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions of FDAMA\" (\"Deficiencies Guidance\") was issued on November 2, 2000. In that guidance document, FDA recommended that its staff use a specific format for requests for additional information needed to make a decision on a medical device marketing submission (often called \"deficiencies\" or \"deficiency letters\") to be in accordance with least burdensome principles. This format was intended to directly connect FDA requests to applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for a decision and optimize the time and effort of both industry and FDA. That guidance document also included a recommended format for industry responses to FDA deficiencies.\n\nWith the enactment of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (Public Law 115-52, SSSS 201-210) (MDUFA IV), FDA committed to updating the Deficiencies Guidance. Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions was issued on September 29, 2017.10 The Deficiencies Guidance was updated to recommend that all deficiency letters include a statement regarding the basis for each deficiency and provides details regarding supervisory review, major/minor deficiencies, additional considerations, and prioritization of deficiencies.\n\nFootnote 10: https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM073680.\n\n\"The Least Burdensome Provisions of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997: Concept and Principles\" was issued on October 4, 2002 (\"2002 Least Burdensome Guidance\"). The guidance stated that, while the least burdensome provisions from FDAMA applied to PMA and 510(k) submissions, FDA believed that least burdensome principles should be implemented for all medical device premarket regulatory activities. The document also defined the term \"least burdensome\" and included suggested approaches for industry and FDA staff to use least burdensome principles in PMA and 510(k) review, including focusing on the statutory and regulatory criteria for marketing authorization. The guidance also described general applications of least burdensome approaches to activities such as postmarket controls, and recommendations for how the Agency should communicate requests for additional information to industry.\n\nThis guidance document replaces the 2002 Least Burdensome Guidance. The statutory updates in FDASIA and the Cures Act clarified the original least burdensome provisions and further recognized the role of postmarket activities as they relate to premarket decisions. FDA believes,as a matter of policy, that least burdensome principles should be consistently and widely applied to all medical device regulatory activities in the premarket and postmarket settings to remove or reduce unnecessary burdens so that patients can have earlier and continued access to high quality, safe and effective devices. The Agency is applying tools in our implementation of these principles, such as regular internal training on least burdensome principles.\n\nThis guidance, therefore, reflects FDA's belief that least burdensome principles should be applied throughout the medical device total product lifecycle. The least burdensome concept remains the same in that the principles are based on sound science, the intent of the law, the use of alternative approaches, and the efficient use of resources to effectively address regulatory issues. We have provided contemporary examples for both premarket and postmarket settings to demonstrate approaches that FDA and industry can take to ensure that least burdensome principles are implemented for all device-related applications and interactions with FDA.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThe least burdensome concept and this guidance apply to all products that meet the statutory definition of a device,11 including device constituent parts of combination products. The policy in this guidance applies to all activities (including premarket and postmarket actions) pertaining to the regulation of medical devices. The policy in this guidance applies, but is not limited, to:\n\nFootnote 11: Section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nPremarket submissions, including premarket approval applications (PMAs), premarket notifications (510(k) submissions), De Novo classification requests, humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications, and investigational device exemption (IDE) applications\n\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver by Applications\n\nAdditional Information and Major Deficiency Letters\n\nQ-Submissions, including Pre-Submissions\n\nInformal or interactive inquiries regarding device development\n\nPanel review and recommendations\n\nPostmarket surveillance, including Medical Device Reports (MDRs) and Post-Approval Studies\n\nReclassifications and 510(k) exemptions\n\nGuidance documents and their application\n\nCompliance-related interactions* Regulation development\n\nIV Guiding Principles\n\nFDA defines least burdensome to be the minimum amount of information necessary to adequately address a relevant regulatory question or issue through the most efficient manner at the right time (e.g., need to know versus nice to know). Our least burdensome definition and principles do not change the applicable statutory and regulatory standards, such as the device approval or clearance standards, nor the applicable requirements, including premarket submission content requirements and the requirement for valid scientific evidence.12\n\nFootnote 12: Sections 513(i) and 515 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E, Parts 812 and 814, and 860.7(c).\n\nNotwithstanding references to what industry should do, our guiding principles explain FDA's commitments for least burdensome device review. FDA intends to, and industry should, apply the following guiding principles when taking a least burdensome approach to a particular question or issue at any point in the total product lifecycle:\n\nFDA intends to request the minimum information necessary to adequately address the regulatory question or issue at hand.\n\nIndustry should submit material, including premarket submissions, to FDA that are least burdensome for FDA to review. * Industry should submit well-organized, clear, and concise information. * Industry should not submit information unrelated to the regulatory decision to FDA. * Industry should reference applicable FDA guidance documents where FDA recommendations were considered.\n\nFDA intends to use the most efficient means to resolve regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to use all reasonable measures to streamline processes and policies, as well as render regulatory decisions within appropriate timeframes, such as MDUFA performance goals. * FDA intends to routinely use both formal and informal interactive approaches, whenever possible, to resolve questions and issues. * FDA intends to, and industry should, use reasonable, tailored approaches that have been adapted to individual circumstances and needs to address regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to take appropriate consideration of the time and resource implications of its requests.\n\nThe right information should be provided at the right time (e.g., just-in-time data collection) to address the right questions. * FDA intends to, and industry should, consider the use of postmarket data collection to reduce premarket data collection whenever appropriate and feasible.\n\nRegulatory approaches should be designed to fit the technology, taking into account its unique innovation cycles, evidence generation needs, and timely patient access.\n\nFDA intends to leverage data from other countries and decisions by, or on behalf of, other national medical device regulatory authorities to the extent appropriate and feasible.\n\nFDA intends to apply least burdensome principles in international medical device convergence and harmonization efforts. * FDA intends to actively engage in the development, recognition, and use of voluntary consensus standards published by international and other standards development organizations.\n\nProviding excellent customer service is critical to successfully applying least burdensome principles. FDA strives for clear and concise communication of its requests, expectations, processes, policies, and decisions, as well as the rationale behind them. Industry can help us apply least burdensome principles by providing FDA with clear and concise requests, premarket submissions, and responses, along with their rationales. Excellent customer service and open lines of communication between FDA and its customers will help to provide regulatory outcomes that best serve patients.\n\nV Applications of Least Burdensome Principles\n--------------------\nContext title: The Least Burdensome Provisions- Concept and Principles Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.48346734046936035", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process\n\nDocument Issued on: December 11, 2008\n\nFor questions regarding the use or interpretation of this guidance in the review of PMAs and PDPs, please contact the Nicole L.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance document. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance document.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance document has been developed to provide the underlying principles and examples to establish a clear and consistent way to approach the decision-making process you follow to determine the type of regulatory submission, if any, that may be required when you modify your lawfully marketed PMA device.\n\nThis guidance applies to class III devices that are subject to premarket approval application (PMA) requirements of section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 360e). This guidance provides the criteria for industry and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) staff to use in determining the type of PMA submission (i.e., traditional PMAs, panel track supplements, 180-day supplements, real-time supplements, Special PMA Supplements-Changes Being Effected, 30-day notices, manufacturing site change supplements, or periodic reports) that you should submit to FDA when you modify the design or labeling of your PMA device; its manufacturing process; or the location of manufacturing, processing, or packaging. The guidance also provides examples of various types of device modifications, describes the types of testing that were performed to support the safety and effectiveness for each device modification, and the type of PMA submission that was submitted. It does not address how to test a specific device to determine the effects of modifications.\n\nThis guidance applies to PMAs reviewed by CDRH and CBER. This guidance also applies if you modify your PMA device in response to a recall or field corrective action to assure the continued safety and/or effectiveness of the device.\n\nThis guidance is not intended to replace existing, device-specific guidance or other guidance documents related to the PMA program.1\n\n2.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance document, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nThe Least Burdensome Approach\n\nWe believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including contact information, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.\n\n3 Background\n\nThe \"PMA regulation\" (21 CFR Part 814) sets forth general criteria for determining when you must submit a PMA supplement or a 30-day notice for a device modification or manufacturing change (21 CFR 814.39). Subpart B \"Premarket Approval Application\" of the PMA regulation in Part 814 describes PMA amendments and supplements. Subpart E -\"Post Approval Requirements\" describes requirements for continuing evaluation (post-approval studies), periodic reporting, and other requirements related to the continued reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of an approved PMA device. The Act defines different types of PMA supplements that are used to request approval of a change to a device that has an approved PMA (see section 737(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)) for definitions of 180-day supplements, real-time supplements, panel-track supplements). These definitions form the basis for the recommendations provided in this guidance document.\n\nThe draft version of this guidance document, which was issued on March 9, 2007, was the result of an extensive effort by a working group consisting of regulatory and scientific experts from CDRH and CBER. That March 2007 draft guidance replaced the August 6, 1998 draft guidance entitled, Modifications To Devices Subject to Premarket Approval - The PMA Supplement Decision Making Process[2] Comments by the industry on the August 1998 draft and comments we received at subsequent meetings on this issue were considered by FDA during the development of the March 2007 draft guidance document.\n\nIn response to the comment period for the March 2007 draft guidance, FDA received the following five general categories of comments from industry. Each category of comment, below, is followed by FDA's response.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIndustry requested clearer interpretation of the PMA regulation as to when a supplement is necessary (i.e., when a change to a device impacts or could impact safety and/or effectiveness). Our response to this is included in Sections III and IV below.\n\nIndustry requested a detailed flowchart that would identify the type of supplement to be submitted based on any specific change for any device. FDA understands that there is a general desire among PMA applicants for such a detailed flowchart or easy-to-use paradigm. However, FDA believes the complexity and variability of class III devices makes it unfeasible to develop such a flowchart.\n\nIndustry requested specific definitions for some terms, such as \"substantial clinical data,\" \"significant change,\" and \"limited confirmatory clinical data.\" Where possible, FDA provided additional clarity for some terminology. Again, because of the complexity and variability of class III devices, we do not believe it is feasible to provide detailed definitions for certain terms and instead use examples to help illustrate the meaning of these terms.\n\nIndustry requested that the guidance address 30-day supplements (21 CFR 814.39(e)). However, FDA has chosen not to include 30-day supplements within the scope of the guidance document, in part, because we have not identified cases for which this provision can be effectively applied.\n\nIndustry requested the addition of examples to illustrate the various supplement types as well as periodic reports.

The guidance describes a comprehensive quality systems (QS) model, highlighting the model's consistency with the CGMP regulatory requirements for manufacturing human and veterinary drugs, including biological drug products. The guidance also explains how manufacturers implementing such quality systems can be in full compliance with parts 210 and 211. This guidance is not intended to place new expectations on manufacturers, nor to replace the CGMP requirements. Readers are advised to always refer to parts 210 and 211 to ensure full compliance with the regulations.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background and Purpose\n\nBackground\n\nIn August 2002, the FDA announced the Pharmaceutical CGMPs for the 21st Century Initiative. In that announcement, the FDA explained the Agency's intent to integrate quality systems and risk management approaches into its existing programs with the goal of encouraging industry to adopt modern and innovative manufacturing technologies. The CGMP initiative was spurred by the fact that since 1978, when the last major revision of the CGMP regulations was published,there have been many advances in manufacturing science and in our understanding of quality systems. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers are already implementing comprehensive, modern quality systems and risk management approaches. This guidance is intended to help manufacturers implementing modern quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of the Agency's CGMP regulations. The Agency also saw a need to harmonize the CGMPs with other non-U.S. pharmaceutical regulatory systems and with FDA's own medical device quality systems regulations. This guidance supports these goals. It also supports the objectives of the Critical Path Initiative, which intends to make the development of innovative medical products more efficient so that safe and effective therapies can reach patients sooner.\n\nThe CGMPs for the 21st Century Initiative steering committee created a Quality System Guidance Development working group (QS working group) to compare the current CGMP regulations, which call for some specific quality management elements, to other existing quality management systems. The QS working group mapped the relationship between CGMP regulations (parts 210 and 211 and the 1978 Preamble to the CGMP regulations2) and various quality system models, such as the Drug Manufacturing Inspections Program (i.e., systems-based inspectional program),3 the Environmental Protection Agency's Guidance for Developing Quality Systems for Environmental Programs, ISO Quality Standards, other quality publications, and experience from regulatory cases. The QS working group determined that, although the CGMP regulations do provide great flexibility, they do not incorporate explicitly all of the elements that today constitute most quality management systems.\n\nFootnote 2: See Reference #1.\n\nFootnote 3: See Reference #2.\n\nThe CGMP regulations and other quality management systems differ somewhat in organization and in certain constituent elements; however, they are very similar and share underlying principles. For example, the CGMP regulations stress quality control. More recently developed quality systems stress quality management, quality assurance, and the use of risk management tools, in addition to quality control. The QS working group decided that it would be very useful to examine exactly how the CGMP regulations and the elements of a modern, comprehensive quality system fit together in today's manufacturing world. This guidance is the result of that examination.\n\nGoal of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance describes a comprehensive quality systems model, which, if implemented, will allow manufacturers to support and sustain robust, modern quality systems that are consistent with CGMP regulations. The guidance demonstrates how and where the elements of this comprehensive model can fit within the requirements of the CGMP regulations. The inherent flexibility of the CGMP regulations should enable manufacturers to implement a quality system in a form that is appropriate for their specific operations.\n\nThe overarching philosophy articulated in both the CGMP regulations and in robust modern quality systems is:Quality should be built into the product, and testing alone cannot be relied on to ensure product quality.\n\nThis guidance is intended to serve as a bridge between the 1978 regulations and our current understanding of quality systems. In addition to being part of the FDA's CGMP initiative, this guidance is being issued for a number of reasons:\n\nA quality system addresses the public and private sectors' mutual goal of providing a high-quality drug product to patients and prescribers. A well-built quality system should reduce the number of (or prevent) recalls, returned or salvaged products, and defective products entering the marketplace.\n\nIt is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for domestic and foreign facilities that are required to register as food facilities under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because they manufacture, process, pack, or hold animal food for consumption in the U.S. This guidance contains information to help these facilities determine whether they need to comply with the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for animal food established in the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals final rule published on September 17, 2015 (80 FR 56170) (the final rule). This guidance also provides additional information and recommendations for compliance with the CGMP requirements for animal food, as well as compliance with related requirements such as training and recordkeeping. The CGMP requirements are codified in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B (subpart B), and some related requirements are codified in 21 CFR part 507, subparts A and F (subparts A and F).\n\nFDA's (hereinafter also referred to as \"Agency\", \"we\", or \"our\") guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance describes the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nOn January 4, 2011, President Obama signed into law the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) (Pub. L. 111-353). This law enables FDA to better protect public health by helping to ensure the safety and security of the animal food supply by focusing on prevention of food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur. As part of our implementation of FSMA, we established risk-based preventive control requirements for the production of animal food by food facilities required to register under section 415 of the FD&C Act (see section 418 of the FD&C Act). At the same time, we established Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding of animal food under section 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act and sections 311, 361, and 368 of the Public Health Service Act.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\nthe hazard is not a \"hazard requiring a preventive control,\" the facility does not need to establish preventive controls, or preventive control management components, for these hazards.1\n\nFootnote 1: We intend to provide more information regarding our current thinking on the evaluation and documentation of prerequisite programs in a hazard analysis in Draft Guidance for Industry (GFI) #245 \u2013 Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals.\n\nIn some situations, implementation of a prerequisite program alone may not be sufficient for a facility to determine that a hazard does not require a preventive control. If a facility determines that a hazard requires a preventive control, the facility must identify and implement a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard and include that preventive control in its written food safety plan (21 CFR 507.34(a)(1) and (b)). The hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls in 21 CFR part 507, subpart C require a facility to identify and control hazards specific to the facility and the animal food it produces which, based on the hazard analysis, are not sufficiently mitigated by CGMPs or other prerequisite programs in place at the facility. In establishing a preventive control for a hazard, the facility may choose to use a procedure that it is already performing, such as a CGMP procedure alone or in combination with other procedures, as the preventive control. This procedure would then be subject to all of the applicable requirements for a preventive control, including monitoring, corrective actions, verification, and validation (21 CFR 507.39).\n\nFor example, a facility may use a flushing procedure as a sanitation measure to clean and maintain equipment surfaces to meet CGMP requirements. If a facility determines that cross-contamination between batches of certain types of animal foods may result in a hazard requiring a preventive control, the facility may wish to use a flushing procedure as their preventive control. In that situation, the flushing procedure would need to be identified as the preventive control in the food safety plan. The flushing procedure would then need to be monitored, verified, and validated when it is being used as a preventive control.\n\n2 Flexible CGMPs for a diverse industry\n\nThe CGMPs serve as baseline standards for producing safe animal food for various types of animal food facilities and animal foods. As the CGMPs were developed, we considered the diversity of the industry and the ultimate goal of animal food safety. We added flexibility where appropriate to address the diversity of facilities, the wide range of animal food activities a facility might engage in, and the potential safety risks posed by some animal foods. These flexible CGMP requirements can be applied in various animal food production settings. In particular, there may be significant differences in how these CGMPs are implemented in facilities where undesirable microorganisms are a food safety concern for the type of animal food produced compared to facilities producing an animal food that is not as likely to be affected by undesirable microorganisms. This guidance provides additional explanation and examples for facilities to implement these CGMPs based on their unique facility and type of animal food.\n\nComplying with the CGMPs\n\nCGMPs serve as baseline standards for producing safe animal food, including preventing insanitary conditions in the production of animal food. Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held according to CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and section 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act). Full compliance with the CGMP provisions should reduce the likelihood that the animal food will be manufactured/processed, packed, or held under insanitary conditions (conditions that may cause the animal food to become contaminated or rendered injurious to health) or be otherwise unfit for food. An animal food does not need to contain a harmful substance to be adulterated.\n\nCompliance with CGMPs also should reduce the likelihood that the animal food will be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the FD&C Act.2 FDA will consider the risk and impact to public health in determining whether to pursue regulatory action because of a CGMP violation.\n\nFootnote 2: Section 402(a)(1) of the FD&C Act states: \u201cA food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance such food shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health.\u201d\n\nThe FD&C Act prohibits introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce adulterated animal food (section 301(a) of the FD&C Act). The FD&C Act also prohibits doing an act (e.g., violating CGMPs) that causes animal food to become adulterated after receipt of that food or its components in interstate commerce while the food is held by a facility for sale (section 301(k) of the FD&C Act). Among other remedies, the government has authority to file actions in court to remove adulterated animal food from the marketplace (seizure) and/or to prevent a firm from continuing to manufacture and distribute adulterated food (injunction) (sections 304 and 302 of the FD&C Act). Following the CGMP requirements for animal food is important because it may help prevent you from producing and distributing adulterated animal food.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #235 Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.0294501781463623", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: 253 Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Animal Cells, Tissues, and Cell- and Tissue-Based Products Guidance for Industry\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is issuing this guidance to provide establishments that manufacture animal cells, tissues, and cell- and tissue-based products (ACTPs) with recommendations for meeting current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. All new animal drugs, including ACTPs, must be manufactured in accordance with CGMP to ensure that such drugs meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as to safety, and have the identity, strength, quality, and purity characteristics which they purport to or are represented to possess.1\n\nFootnote 1: See section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B)]\n\nThere are both statutory and regulatory requirements for CGMP. The CGMP statutory requirements are found in section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. The CGMP regulatory requirements are found in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).\n\nFDA recognizes that the manufacture of ACTPs presents unique considerations for complying with regulatory CGMP and that these CGMP regulations do not specifically or fully address all aspects of the manufacture of ACTPs, including early stages of the ACTP manufacturing process. This document is specific to ACTPs to help establishments that manufacture ACTPs meet statutory and applicable regulatory CGMP. New animal drugs not manufactured in conformity with statutory and regulatory CGMP are adulterated under the relevant provisions of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn this guidance, we address the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing ACTPs, including steps in recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution. The recommendations in this document should be applied to consistently produce quality ACTPs and to ensure that ACTPs are not contaminated and do not become contaminated during manufacturing. Generally, when we refer to CGMP in this document, we are referring either to statutory CGMP including those ACTP-specific recommendations provided in this document for meeting statutory CGMP, or applicable regulatory CGMP, or both.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nPredistribution shipment means the conveyance or shipment of an ACTP within your establishment or between establishments before it has met its product release criteria (i.e., it is not released for distribution).\n\nProcess control means controls put in place to address variability and to ensure product quality. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points.\n\nProcessing means any activity performed on an ACTP, other than recovery, donor screening, donor testing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution. Processing includes activities such as testing for microorganisms, preparation, sterilization, steps to inactivate or remove adventitious agents, preservation for storage, and removal from storage.\n\nQuarantine of ACTP means the storage or identification of an ACTP, to prevent improper release, in a physically separate area clearly identified for such use or through use of other procedures, such as automated designation.\n\nRecovery means obtaining from a donor (live or deceased) cells or tissues that are intended for use in implantation, transplantation, infusion, transfer, or other means of administration to an animal recipient.\n\nValidation means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that particular requirements can consistently be fulfilled (e.g., a process consistently produces an ACTP that meets its predetermined specifications).\n\nValidated methods means analytical methods confirmed to be suitable for their intended use through parameters such as accuracy, precision, robustness, linearity, range, specificity, limit of quantitation, and limit of detection.\n\nVerification means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that specific requirements have been fulfilled.\n\nYou means the establishment that performs a manufacturing step or the establishment that performs a manufacturing step under contract, agreement, or other arrangement for another establishment.\n\nIII Purpose and SCOPE\n\nThis guidance is intended for any establishment that performs a manufacturing step for production of an ACTP, including autologous, allogeneic, and xenogeneic ACTPs. Preserving cellular function and integrity, ensuring consistency of the process and product, and preventing contamination are critical aspects of manufacturing ACTPs. The safety, effectiveness, and quality of an ACTP are dependent on appropriate control of the manufacturing process.\n\nEstablishments performing any part of a manufacturing process or any establishment utilized under a contract, agreement, or other arrangement for performing any step in the process must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory CGMP.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe are providing these recommendations to help ensure that establishments are in compliance with statutory and regulatory CGMP. In some cases, regulatory CGMP does not fully or specifically address those aspects of ACTP manufacturing necessary to ensure the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the product. For example, regulatory CGMP does not address critical items that we consider necessary to meet statutory CGMP such as donor eligibility or recovery of ACTPs.\n\nEstablishments performing part of a manufacturing process must comply with CGMP that are appropriate for the manufacturing steps they perform with the ACTP. Prior to entering into any contract, agreement, or other arrangement with another establishment, the ACTP sponsor should ensure that the establishment is following the recommendations for meeting CGMP in this document or is otherwise ensuring that the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of ACTPs complies with CGMP.\n\nCategory A Establishments\n\nEstablishments that manufacture finished ACTPs, other than Type II finished ACTPs,3 are Category A establishments.\n\nFootnote 3: Autologous ACTPs are Type II products if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\na. The ACTP is minimally manipulated;\n\nb. The ACTP is for homologous use;\n\nc. The ACTP is for use in nonfood-producing animals;\n\nd. The manufacture of the ACTP does not involve the combination of the cells with another article, except for water, crystalloids, or a sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent, provided that the addition of water, crystalloids, or the sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent does not raise new safety concerns with respect to the product; and\n\ne. The finished ACTP is not combined with or modified by the addition of any component that is a drug or device.

PURPOSE\n\nThis guideline informs interested persons on certain practices and procedures for the preparation of investigational new drug products for human and animal use that may be useful to persons seeking to comply with certain sections of the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals (Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 and 211).\n\nII. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe notice of availability of the draft guideline (53 FR 5835) stated that this guideline would be issued under $ 10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the use of guidelines to establish procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable to the agency. The agency is now in the process of considering whether to revise $ 10.90(b). Although that decision-making process is not yet complete, the agency has decided to publish this guideline. However, this final guideline is not being issued under the authority of $ 10.90(b), and, although called a guideline, it does not operate to bind the FDA or any other person in any way.\n\nThe agency advises that this final guideline represents its current position on the requirements of the CGMP regulations. The guideline may be useful to manufacturers of investigational new drug products produced for clinical trials in humans and animals. A person may also choose to use alternate procedures even though they are not provided for in the guideline. If a person chooses to depart from the practices and procedures set forth in the final guideline, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable by FDA. This guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person.\n\nThis guideline may be amended from time to time as FDA recognizes the need through its regulatory efforts and through comments submitted by interested persons.\n\nQuestions have been raised as to what FDA might consider acceptable ways of complying with certain requirements of the CGMP regulations, regarding the preparation of investigational new drug products for human or animal use. An investigational new drug product for human use is defined as a drug product (i.e., dosage form) covered by an investigational new drug application (synonymous with a \"Notice of Claimed Investigational\n\nExemption for a New Drug\"), Form FDA-1571, commonly referred to\n\nas an IND (21 CFR Part 312). An investigational new animal drug\n\n(INAD) is defined as a drug product (i.e., dosage form) covered\n\nby \"A Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New\n\nAnimal Drug\" (21 CFR 511.1). The questions that have been raised\n\nconcern, for the most part, the fact that product specifications\n\nand production methods for an investigational product may be\n\nsubject to frequent change as the clinical testing of the product\n\nprogresses.\n\nFDA recognizes that manufacturing procedures and specifications\n\nwill change as clinical trials advance. Analytical test methods\n\nmay also be refined, or different methods used in response, for\n\nexample, to formulation changes that interfere with some methods.\n\nHowever, as research nears completion, appropriate analytical\n\nmethods should be well established and procedures and controls\n\nare expected to be more specific because they will have been\n\nbased upon a growing body of scientific data and documentation.\n\nQuestions have also been raised as to when, in the research and\n\ndevelopment of a new drug, a manufacturer must comply with the\n\nprovisions of the CGMP regulations. During initial research and\n\ndevelopment, there is experimentation with the new drug substance\n\nand its dosage form; such experiments typically involve the\n\ndrug's chemistry and toxicity studies conducted on laboratory\n\nanimals. The CGMP regulations do not apply for the preparation\n\nof the new drug substance or drug products during such initial\n\npreclinical experimentation. However, it is nonetheless\n\nimportant to process materials under conditions to assure their\n\nintegrity, and to maintain adequate records.\n\nWhen drug development reaches the stage where the drug products\n\nare produced for clinical trials in humans or animals, then\n\ncompliance with the CGMP regulations is required. For example,\n\nthe drug product must be produced in a qualified facility, using\n\nlaboratory and other equipment that has been qualified, and\n\nprocesses must be validated.\n\nAt early clinical stages, where a single batch of drug product\n\nmay be produced, and where significant formulation and processing\n\nchanges may make batch replication difficult or inexact, only\n\nlimited process validation may be possible. In such cases,\n\nlimited validation, especially for such critical processes as\n\nsterilization, should be derived, to the extent possible, from\n\nproduct and process analogs. In addition, data obtained from\n\nextensive in-process controls and intensive product testing may\n\nbe used to demonstrate that the instant run yielded a finished\n\nproduct meeting all of its specifications and quality\n\ncharacteristics. It is expected that more comprehensive process\n\nvalidation will be conducted as additional uniform batches are\n\nmade under replicated conditions.\n\nThere must also be written procedures for sanitation, calibration, and maintenance of equipment, and specific instructions for the use of the equipment and procedures used to manufacture the drug product.\n\nFDA, while recognizing the differences between the manufacture of investigational products and commercial products, believes that it is nonetheless vital that investigational products be made in conformance with current good manufacturing practice. Product contamination and wide variations in potency can produce substantial levels of side effects and toxicity, and even produce wide-sweeping effects on the physiological activity of the drug. Product safety, quality, and uniformity are especially significant in the case of investigational products. Such factors may affect the outcome of a clinical investigation that will, in large measure, determine whether or not the product will be approved for wider distribution to the public.\n\nAccordingly, FDA is committed to ensuring that investigational drug products are manufactured using adequate manufacturing facilities to ensure good quality control. In this regard, investigational drug products, like products approved for marketing, have always been subject to the agency's CGMP inspectional activities. The CGMP regulations, these inspectional activities, and this guideline apply to all such products, including investigational drug products intended for treatment use--see 21 CFR Part 312.\n\nIn this guideline, requirements of specific sections of 21 CFR Part 211 are presented along with practices and procedures that FDA believes may be useful to persons seeking to meet those requirements. This guideline does not attempt to address all sections of the regulations that apply to the preparation of investigational new drug products, but rather only those sections for which questions have been raised most frequently.\n\nIII. CONTROL OF COMPONENTS\n\nRequirements\n\nSection 211.80(a) requires, in part, control of components and drug product containers and closures by means of written procedures that detail handling, identification, sampling, testing, and storage.\n\nSection 211.84(a) requires, in part, testing or examination as appropriate and approval of components, containers, and closures, before use.\n\nGuidance\n\nFDA recognizes that the experimental nature of the drug substance, formulation, and dosage form at an early stage of development will have an impact on establishing specifications. At early stages, the acceptance/rejection criteria may not be as specific; however, it is vital that such criteria be scientifically sound and based upon available scientific data. Specifications used as the basis for approval or rejection of components, containers, and closures will be more specific and uniform as additional data become available. It is vital that, at all stages, specifications used are fully documented.\n\nIV. PRODUCTION AND PROCESS CONTROLs\n\nRequirements\n\nSection 211.100 requires, in part, that procedures that have a bearing on quality of drug products be written, be approved by the quality control unit, and be followed and documented in the execution of the production and process controls.\n\nGuidance\n--------------------\nContext title: Preparation of Investigational New Drug Products (Human and Animal) Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.4679112434387207", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: Contract Manufacturing\n\nArrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreements\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n\nNovember 2016\n\nPharmaceutical Quality/Manufacturing Standards (CGMP)\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nContract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs:\n\nQuality Agreements\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality and the Office of Compliance in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Center for Veterinary Medicine, and the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's current thinking on defining, establishing, and documenting manufacturing activities of the parties involved in contract drug manufacturing subject to current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. In particular, we describe how parties involved in contract drug manufacturing can use quality agreements to delineate their manufacturing activities to ensure compliance with CGMP.\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, we use certain terms with the following specific meanings:\n\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) refers to requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), section 501(a)(2)(B), for all drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). For finished human and animal drugs, the term includes applicable requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211. For biologics, the term includes additional applicable requirements under 21 CFR parts 600-680.\n\nCommercial manufacturing refers to manufacturing processes that result in a drug or drugs intended to be marketed, distributed, or sold.\n\nCommercial manufacturing does not include research and development activities, manufacturing of material for investigational new drug studies (e.g., clinical trials, expanded access), or manufacturing of material for veterinary investigational drugs. Although this guidance does not explicitly apply to the manufacture of investigational, developmental, or clinical trial materials, FDA believes that quality agreements can be extremely valuable in delineating the activities of all parties involved in contract research and development arrangements. Many of the principles described in this guidance could be applied in pre-commercial stages of the pharmaceutical life cycle.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nManufacturing includes processing, packing, holding, labeling operations, testing, and quality unit operations.\n\nA manufacturer is an entity that engages in CGMP activities, including implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to ensure quality.2 Footnote 2: See section 501 of the FD&C Act, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144, title VII, section 711).\n\nQuality unit is defined as synonymous with the term quality control unit.3\n\nFootnote 3: For quality control unit, see 21 CFR 210.3.\n\nThis guidance covers commercial manufacturing of the following categories of drugs: human drugs, veterinary drugs, certain combination products, biological and biotechnology products, finished products, APIs, drug substances, in-process materials, and drug constituents of combination drug/device products.4 This guidance does not cover the following types of products: Type A predicated articles and medicated feed, medical devices, dietary supplements, or human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR part 1271.\n\nFootnote 4: Combination product manufacturers can apply this guidance to their quality agreements because they are subject to requirements under 21 CFR part 211 and/or 21 CFR part 820 (see 21 CFR 4.3). In addition to facilitating compliance with requirements under 21 CFR part 211, manufacturers can use quality agreements with contract facilities to demonstrate compliance, in part, with 21 CFR 820.50 (purchasing controls) and with 21 CFR 820.80(b) (receiving acceptance activities) for combination products.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Defining the Who and What of Contract Manufacturing\n\nThis guidance describes how contract manufacturing operations fit within the larger scheme of pharmaceutical quality systems. It also presents the Agency's current thinking on the roles and manufacturing activities of the parties involved in contract manufacturing arrangements.\n\nSpecifically, this guidance addresses the relationship between owners and contract facilities. For purposes of this guidance, we define owners as manufacturers of APIs, drug substances, in-process materials, finished drug products, including biological products, and combination products. The term owner does not apply to retail pharmacies, drug stores, supermarkets, discount warehouse stores, or other retailers who purchase finished drug products to sell over the counter as a store brand. For purposes of this guidance, we define contract facilities as parties that perform one or more manufacturing operations on behalf of an owner or owners.5\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDrug manufacturing encompasses many discrete operations and activities. One manufacturer may perform all operations and activities or may engage an outside party or parties to perform some or all of the operations and activities under contract. Contract facilities perform a variety of manufacturing operations and activities, including but not limited to:\n\nFormulation\n\nFill and finish\n\nChemical synthesis\n\nCell culture and fermentation, including for biological products\n\nAnalytical testing and other laboratory services\n\nPackaging and labeling\n\nSterilization or terminal sterilization\n\nHowever, agreements between owners and contract facilities sometimes do not clearly define the CGMP-related roles and manufacturing operations and activities of each of the parties. When all parties clearly understand their CGMP-related roles and manufacturing responsibilities, the owners who use contract facilities, contract facilities that provide services to owners, and, ultimately, patients who take the drugs manufactured under these arrangements may benefit in many ways. Contracting can enhance speed and efficiency, provide technological expertise, and expand capacity.\n\nWe encourage entities that engage in manufacturing related solely to drug distribution (e.g., distributors, brokers, private label distributors, own label distributors) to follow the recommendations in this guidance document, as appropriate. Our focus here, however, is on the roles and manufacturing activities of the owner and contract facility.\n\nIII Responsibilities of parties involved in contract manufacturing\n\nEach party engaged in the manufacture of a drug is responsible for ensuring compliance with CGMP for the manufacturing activities it performs.6 For both owners and contract facilities that conduct manufacturing operations, CGMP \"includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.\"7 Drugs not manufactured in compliance with CGMP are adulterated.8\n\nFootnote 6: Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR parts 210 and 211; and 21 CFR part 600.\n\nFootnote 7: Section 501 of the FD&C Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144, Title VII, section 711).\n\nFootnote 8: Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe FD&C Act also prohibits any person from introducing or delivering for introduction an adulterated or misbranded drug into interstate commerce.9 In addition, it prohibits anyone from the \"doing of any... act with respect to, a... drug... if such act is done while such article is heldfor sale... after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being adulterated or misbranded.\"10\n\nFDA's regulations recognize that owners commonly use contract facilities to perform some drug manufacturing activities.11 When an owner uses a contract facility, the owner's quality unit is legally responsible for approving or rejecting drug products manufactured by the contract facility, including for final release.12 The regulations require that the quality unit's responsibilities and procedures be in writing and that they be followed.13\n\nFootnote 10: Section 301(k) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 200.10(b) and 211.22(a).\n--------------------\nContext title: Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs- Quality Agreements Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.0266613960266113", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to postmarketing recordkeeping and safety reporting applicable to all approved drug and biological products.21 Information on withdrawal procedures, submission of promotional materials, and termination of certain requirements for products approved under the Animal Rule is specified in the regulations.22\n\nFootnote 21: See 21 CFR 314.630 for drugs and 21 CFR 601.93 for biological products.\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 314.620, 21 CFR 314.640, and 21 CFR 314.650, respectively, for drugs and 21 CFR 601.92, 21 CFR 601.94, and 21 CFR 601.95, respectively, for biological products.\n\nIII Regulatory Considerations\n\nDrug Development Plan\n\nObtaining the body of evidence necessary to support approval of a drug using the Animal Rule is a complex and iterative process. FDA strongly encourages sponsors to establish early and ongoing communications with the Agency. Sponsors also may wish to seek input from public health officials and/or the military about the potential need for, and operational use of, the investigational drug and discuss this with FDA. Developing a drug development plan will support the discussion of important issues, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\nThe proposed indication and whether a drug can be developed under the Animal Rule\n\nThe design of an animal study as it relates to the anticipated clinical use of the drug during an incident\n\nThe development and/or selection of the animal models, including, when necessary, the design of the natural history studies\n\nThe results of the proof-of-concept studies\n\nThe proposed methods for selecting an effective dose and regimen in humans\n\nThe design of the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies intended to provide the primary evidence of effectiveness of the drug\n\nThe proposed approach for ensuring the quality and integrity of data23 Footnote 23: In issuing the Animal Rule, FDA stated that \u201c (\\ldots) studies subject to this rule must be conducted in accordance with preexisting requirements under the good laboratory practices (21 CFR part 58) regulations (\\ldots)\u201d (67 FR 37988 at 37989, May 31, 2002). The good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations, however, were developed as a quality system for nonclinical safety studies. FDA\u2019s current expectations are described in section IV.B.\n\nThe size and composition of the human safety database\n\n2.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPlans or approaches for conducting the required postmarketing studies (e.g., field studies) to demonstrate safety and clinical benefit when such studies are feasible and ethical24 Footnote 24: See 21 CFR 314.610(b)(1) for drugs and 21 CFR 601.91(b)(1) for biological products.\n\nTimelines and/or milestones for FDA feedback or meetings\n\nEligibility for expedited development and review designation programs\n\nAdditional issues critical to the sponsor's funding agencies25\n\nFootnote 25: Product development plans required by funding agencies for medical countermeasures against CBRN agents may dictate certain proof-of-concept studies and an accelerated timeline for efficacy studies in animals. The sponsor\u2019s relationship with its funding agency is independent of its relationship with FDA.\n\nDrug development is data-driven; any development plan should allow for modification or refinement as data are gathered and analyzed and projections or expectations change. It is the sponsor's responsibility to provide complete and accurate submissions. Sponsors should explain any proposed deviations from the recommendations expressed in this guidance. The potential impact of these deviations on the drug development program should be discussed with FDA before the conduct of the relevant studies.\n\nFDA strongly recommends that sponsors obtain Agency concurrence on the design of the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies because these substitute for the efficacy trials in humans (see sections VI and X). Sponsors should allow adequate time for FDA review, comment, and agreement before initiating these studies to ensure that the study design is adequate to support the proposed indication.\n\nThe protocols for animal efficacy studies intended to provide primary evidence of effectiveness are eligible for evaluation under special protocol assessment (SPA) provisions.26({}^{,})27 Before submitting a Request for SPA, the sponsor should have FDA concurrence on the model proposed for use in the efficacy study (including, but not limited to, the species, the details of the challenge agent, the conditions of exposure) and the method that will be used to extrapolate from the animal data to select an effective dose and regimen in humans.\n\nFootnote 26: Section 505(b)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act (as amended by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013, Public Law 113-5) provides for the use of SPA provisions \u201cin the case where human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible, of animal and any associated clinical trials which, in combination, are intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim.\u201d\n\nDrugs developed under the Animal Rule may be eligible for two of the expedited development and review programs28 (fast track and priority review) or other FDA programs, such as orphan drug designation.29 Sponsors requesting these designations should use established procedures. Drugs being developed under the Animal Rule do not meet the statutory requirement forbreakthrough therapy designation, which specifically requires clinical evidence of a treatment effect.30 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA)31 and the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA)32 may also apply to drugs developed under the Animal Rule.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 506 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 356) (as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), Public Law 112-144).\n\nFootnote 31: See Public Law 107-109.\n\nFootnote 32: See Public Law 108-155.\n\nSponsors should note that FDA may seek input from advisory committees for various issues related to the Animal Rule. Issues for discussion can include whether the Animal Rule is the appropriate regulatory development pathway for drugs intended for a specific indication, concurrence on the animal model of a disease or condition, the acceptability of the use of an animal model with a specific investigational drug, the design of adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies, and whether the data obtained support approval. In some instances, more than one advisory committee meeting may be warranted at different times in a single development program.\n\nAccess to Investigational Drugs During a Public Health Emergency\n\nData collected from animal efficacy studies may support the emergency use of drugs under an investigational new drug application (IND)33 or an emergency use authorization (EUA).34 FDA's decision to allow emergency use of a drug under an IND or EUA will be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the anticipated or actual emergency, size of the affected population, data included in the submission, and risk-benefit analysis. A decision to allow emergency use of the drug under an IND or EUA, based on data submitted in support of either mechanism, should not be viewed as an FDA determination on approvability of the drug or a final drug development goal. FDA emphasizes that drug development and systematic data collection should be continued to obtain the body of evidence to support drug approval and associated postmarketing requirements. In the event of an unexpected increase or occurrence of a disease or condition, sponsors should discuss with FDA if field studies have become feasible and ethical (see related discussion in section II).\n\nCommunications With FDA\n\nSponsors are encouraged to hold discussions with FDA in the early stages of a drug development program. Sponsors unsure of the appropriate regulatory review division or office for their investigational drugs can inquire through the electronic mailbox, CDER-CBER-ARJurisdiction@ftda.hhs.gov, provided by CDER and CBER for this sole purpose.\n\nSponsors should consult Agency guidance regarding the process and expectations for formal meetings.35 The sponsor and review division should discuss the avenues and expectations for obtaining Agency concurrence on the design of the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies and for addressing extenuating or unforeseen circumstances. It is the sponsor's responsibility to build sufficient time into the development plan to permit the review, discussion, and resolution of issues prior to the initiation of relevant studies. FDA will try to accommodate the sponsor should unforeseen circumstances arise.\n\nFootnote 35: See FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants (Revision 1). In the Federal Register of March 11, 2015 (80 FR 12822), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of a draft guidance Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products (Revision 2). The revised draft guidance updates the guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants (Revision 1) and, when finalized, will represent the Agency\u2019s current thinking on the topic.\n\nSome of the drug development issues that should be the subject of meetings with FDA36 will differ from those for drugs developed under other regulatory pathways. Examples of issues for Animal Rule drug development discussions are listed in section III.A.\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Development Under the Animal Rule\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.4381613731384277"], "Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1997-D-0056)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-1997-D-0056\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1997-D-0056).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Label Warning Statements for Iron-Containing Supplements and Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.137066602706909", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2009-D-0260\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Submitting a Report for Multiple Facilities to the Reportable Food Electronic Portal (Spanish Translation) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.9874136447906494", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2009-D-0260\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260).\n\n(\\copyright) Search for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Submitting a Report for Multiple Facilities to the Reportable Food Electronic Portal (French Translation) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.93217134475708", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2020-D-1930)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2020-D-1930\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2020-D-1930).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry and FDA- Dear Manufacturer Letter Regarding Sugar Free Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.645169496536255", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: 1.1.

Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product's proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product's proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word \"biosimilar.\"For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product's indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n\nImmunogenicity information for therapeutic protein products is usually placed in a subsection in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section entitled Immunogenicity. To help health care providers interpret the significance of the information, the following or a similar statement should be included as the first paragraph in the subsection, preceding the immunogenicity data based on the reference product labeling:\n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other [core name] products may be misleading.\n\nFda-Approved Patient Labeling\n\nIf a Medication Guide is required, applicants must follow existing Medication Guide regulations for biosimilar product labeling.17 If the FDA-approved patient labeling for the reference product includes Patient Information, applicants should develop Patient Information for the biosimilar product, incorporating relevant information from the Patient Information for the reference product, with appropriate modifications.\n\nFootnote 17: See 21 CFR part 208.\n\nIf the FDA-approved patient labeling for the reference product includes Instructions for Use (IFU), the IFU for the proposed biosimilar product should incorporate relevant information from the IFU for the reference product and present the information in a similar manner. The proposed IFU may differ from the IFU for the reference product where, for example, modified language or images are needed to describe the biosimilar product accurately. If other changes are proposed beyond those necessary to describe the biosimilar product accurately, applicants should discuss proposed changes with the Agency, including whether such changes are appropriate and whether additional data to support such changes are warranted. Additionally, if there are plans to conduct a human factors study and the applicant intends to submit a protocol for FDA's review, the applicant should seek FDA input on the proposed IFU when the human factors study protocol is submitted for FDA review. A full and final review of proposed product labeling, including the IFU, will occur in the context of the planned 351(k) application and may be informed by any human factors study findings submitted or other relevant data included in the application.\n\nVI Revising Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nUpdating Safety Information\n\nDuring the lifecycle of a biological product, changes in the labeling may be necessary to provide updated information needed for the safe and effective use of the product. As the reference product and biosimilar product are used more widely or under diverse conditions, new information may become available. This may include new risks or new information about known risks. A biosimilar product application holder must comply with applicable requirements regarding adverse experience review, reporting, and recordkeeping (see 21 CFR 600.80).\n\nWhen new information becomes available that causes information in labeling to be inaccurate, false, or misleading, the application holder must take steps to change the content of its product labeling, in accordance with 21 CFR 601.12.18 All holders of marketing applications for biological products have an ongoing obligation to ensure their labeling is accurate and up to date.19 A biological product is misbranded, in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (FD&C Act), when its labeling is false or misleading; does not provide adequate directions for use and adequate warnings; or prescribes, recommends, or suggests a dosage, manner, frequency, or duration of use of the drug that is dangerous to health (see 21 U.S.C. 331(a) through (b) and 352(a), (f), and (j)).\n\nAdditional Conditions of Use\n\nFDA recognizes that a biosimilar product application holder may be interested in seeking licensure for an additional condition(s) of use after product licensure in the following scenarios:\n\nThe biosimilar product applicant originally obtained licensure for fewer than all of the conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is seeking licensure for one or more of the remaining licensed conditions of use of the reference product.\n\nThe biologics license application (BLA) holder for the reference product received licensure for a new condition of use for the reference product after the original licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nThe biosimilar product applicant may seek licensure for an additional condition(s) of use of the reference product in these scenarios by submitting a prior approval supplement(s) to the 351(k) application that contains the necessary data and information, including draft labeling revised to include the additional condition(s) of use sought. For more information on how to support licensure of the biosimilar product for an additional condition(s) of use for which the reference product is licensed, refer to the guidance documents on biosimilar product development on FDA's website.20\n\nFootnote 20: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm290967.htm\n\nVII How to submit initial and revised labeling\n\nNew BLAs and supplement submissions for biosimilar product labeling should include the following:\n\nA clean version of reference product labeling that was used to develop the biosimilar product labeling\n\nA tracked changes and annotated version of proposed biosimilar product labeling explaining the differences from the reference product labeling\n\nA clean version of the proposed biosimilar product labeling_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nVIII Interchangeable Products\n\nAny specific recommendations for labeling for interchangeable products, including any interchangeability statement similar to the biosimilarity statement described in section IV.C.1.b of this guidance, will be provided in future guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3750580549240112", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n\nFor directive statements and recommendations for preventing, monitoring, managing, or mitigating risks (e.g., \"Discontinue NEXSYMEO in patients with [adverse reaction]\") -- Such statements are typically included in, but are not limited to, the BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS sections.\n\nThe biosimilar product's proper name should be used when referring to the drug substance. An example would be to use the biosimilar product's proper name in the DESCRIPTION section.\n\nWhen use of the reference product name is recommended:\n\nWhen clinical studies or data derived from studies with the reference product are described in biosimilar product labeling, the reference product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-hjsf) should be used. This information would typically be included in sections such as, but not limited to, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Clinical Trials Experience subsection) and CLINICAL STUDIES.\n\nWhen use of the core name is recommended:14\n\nFootnote 14: Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoetin alfa. The proper name for biological products will include a distinguishing suffix composed of four lowercase letters attached to the core name with a hyphen.\n\nThe overall risk-benefit profile of the reference product is relevant to the biosimilar product, even if a particular serious adverse reaction or other risk included in the reference product labeling may not have been reported with the biosimilar product at the time of licensure. In labeling sections where the risk applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (e.g., BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, Warnings and PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Postmarketing Experience subsection)), it would be appropriate to use the core name of the reference product followed by the word \"products\" (e.g., replicamab products) to convey, for instance, that a risk or other information necessary for the safe use of the product applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (see section IV.B of this guidance).\n\nFor example, in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nReference Product Labeling & Biosimilar Product Labeling \\ \\hline Treatment with JUNEXANT increases & Treatment with replicamab products \\ the risk of serious infections involving & increases the risk of serious infections \\ various organ systems and sites that may & involving various organ systems and sites \\ lead to hospitalization or death. & that may lead to hospitalization or death. \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n4. When use of more than one product name is recommended:\n\nThere may be text appropriately based on the reference product labeling where more than one of these product identification approaches should be used to convey information accurately.\n\nTherefore, all text in biosimilar product labeling, even sections that have been based on reference product labeling, should be carefully evaluated for the most appropriate product identification approach. In some cases, such as the following example, more than two of the approaches may be used:\n\nReplicamab products can cause hepatotoxicity and acute hepatic failure. In clinical trials of replicamab-hjxf, 10% of patients developed elevated ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and 5% progressed to acute hepatic failure. Evaluate serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin at baseline and monthly during treatment with NEXSYMEO...\n\nApproaches to Content Presentation\n\nThe labeling for the biosimilar product should be specific to the conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) sought for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with language previously approved for the reference product for those conditions of use.\n\nWhen a biosimilar product applicant obtains licensure for fewer than all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) for which the reference product is licensed, certain text in the reference product labeling related to condition(s) of use for the reference product that are not licensed for the biosimilar product would generally not be included in the biosimilar product labeling.15 However, in certain circumstances it may be necessary to include information in the biosimilar product labeling relating to an indication(s) for which the biosimilar product is not licensed, in order to help ensure safe use (e.g., when safety information in the reference product labeling is related to use of the product and is not specific to a particular licensed indication(s) or when information specific to only the biosimilar product's indication(s) cannot be easily extracted).16 Such text should be written in a manner that does not imply that the biosimilar product is licensed for a reference product indication(s) or use(s) that has not been licensed for the biosimilar product. In these circumstances, specific sections of labeling that could be affected include BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS.\n\nFootnote 16: See also 21 CFR 201.57(c)(6)(i).\n\nFor example, for sections such as WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS, the reference product labeling may pool and categorize events from all the reference product clinical trials for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed. In cases where the biosimilar product applicant is not seeking licensure for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed, the pooled data described in the reference product labeling should be included in the biosimilar product labeling in a manner that is not indication-specific. However, any text that refers to an indication for which the biosimilar product applicant is not currently seeking licensure and is included to ensure safe use of the biosimilar product should be revised to avoid an implication that the biosimilar has been licensed for that indication(s).\n\nApproaches to Specific Sections of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION (Highlights) a. Initial U.S. approval\n\nThe initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section is the year that the biosimilar product is licensed.\n\nb. Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product's proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product's proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word \"biosimilar.\"For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product's indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.32982203364372253", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6615872383117676", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA's draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9039720892906189", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: The type and extent of animal or clinical studies that are needed to demonstrate biosimilarity of the proposed product can be influenced by several factors, especially the ability to discern differences between the proposed product and reference product and their potential effect on safety, purity, and potency. For example, factors such as the ability to robustly characterize the proposed product or the reference product (e.g., lack of suitable or sufficiently discriminative analytical techniques) or availability of a relevant drug substance derived from the reference product could affect the nature and extent of subsequent animal or clinical studies.\n\nIn general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. Under certain circumstances, a sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity must include an adequate comparison of the proposed product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. If a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study or a clinical study comparing its proposed product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nAs a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies (e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compares all three products (i.e., the proposed product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product) and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK and/or PD study data for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the pre-specified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK and/or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include, but are not limited to, the scientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK and, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on productperformance.14 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.15 A final determination of the adequacy of the information will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 14: For a more complete discussion of the Agency\u2019s current thinking on issues related to bridging data to support use of a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies, see the guidance for industry Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.\n\nFootnote 15: Please refer to the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product.\n\nV Factors for Consideration in Assessing Whether Products Are Highly Similar\n\nWhen assessing whether products are highly similar, manufacturers should consider a number of factors, including the following:\n\nExpression System\n\nTherapeutic protein products can be produced in microbial cells (prokaryotic or eukaryotic), cell lines (e.g., mammalian, avian, insect, plant), or tissues derived from animals or plants. It is expected that the expression construct for a proposed product will encode the same primary amino acid sequence as its reference product. However, minor modifications, such as N- or C-terminal truncations (e.g., the heterogeneity of C-terminal lysine of a monoclonal antibody) that are not expected to change the product performance, may be justified and should be explained by the sponsor. Possible differences between the chosen expression system (i.e., host cell and the expression construct) of the proposed product and that of the reference product should be carefully considered because the type of expression system will affect the types of process- and product-related substances, impurities, and contaminants (including potential adventitious agents) that may be present in the protein product. For example, the expression system can have a significant effect on the types and extent of translational and posttranslational modifications that are imparted to the proposed product, which may introduce additional uncertainty into the demonstration that the proposed product is highly similar to the reference product.\n\nMinimizing differences between the proposed and reference expression systems to the extent possible can enhance the likelihood of producing a highly similar protein product. Use of different expression systems will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nManufacturing Process\n\nA comprehensive understanding of all steps in the manufacturing process for the proposed product should be established during product development. Characterization tests, process controls, and specifications that will emerge from information gained during process development must be specific for the proposed product and manufacturing process. The use of enhanced approaches 16 to pharmaceutical development, along with quality risk management and effective quality systems, will facilitate the consistent manufacturing of a high-quality product. As a scientific matter, as with 351(a) BLAs, a type II Drug Master File (DMF) for a drug substance, drug substance intermediate, or drug product would not be acceptable for a 351(k) application because a license holder is expected to have knowledge of and control over the manufacturing process for the biological product for which it has a license.17 Other types of contract manufacturing arrangements can be considered if the sponsor does not intend to manufacture the product for licensure.18\n\nFootnote 16: See the guidances for industry ICH Q8(R2), ICH Q9, ICH Q10, and ICH Q11 for guidance on enhanced approaches in manufacturing science.\n\nFootnote 17: A type II DMF may, however, be used to support an investigational new drug application (IND) for a biosimilar product. Assurance of product quality should be provided on each lot of material produced by the DMF holder. Procedures should also be in place to ensure that the IND sponsor is notified by the DMF holder of significant changes to the DMF potentially affecting product quality. The sponsor is expected to provide notification to the Agency of any relevant change in the IND in order to initiate a reevaluation of the DMF.\n\nA sponsor considering manufacturing changes after completing the initial analytical similarity assessment or after completing clinical studies intended to support a 351(k) application will need to demonstrate comparability between the pre- and post-change proposed product and may need to conduct additional analytical studies. The nature and extent of the changes may determine the extent of these additional similarity studies. The analytical similarity studies should include a sufficient number of lots of the proposed biosimilar product used in clinical studies as well as from the proposed commercial process if the process used to produce the material used in the clinical studies is different.\n\nAssessment of Physicochemical Properties\n\nPhysicochemical assessment of the proposed product and the reference product should consider all relevant characteristics of the protein product (e.g., the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure; posttranslational modifications; and functional activity(ies)). The objective of this assessment is to maximize the potential for detecting differences in quality attributes between the proposed product and the reference product.\n\nThe sponsor should address the concept of the desired product (and its variants) as discussed in ICH Q6B when designing and conducting the characterization studies. Thus, it will be important to understand the heterogeneity of the proposed product and the reference product (e.g., the nature, location, and levels of glycosylation) and the ranges of variability of different isoforms, including those that result from posttranslational modifications.\n\nParticular analytical methodologies can be used to assess specific physicochemical characteristics of proteins. These methodologies are described in published documents, including scientific literature, regulatory guidelines, and pharmacopeial compendia. Some techniques provide information on multiple characteristics. It is expected that appropriate analytical test methods will be selected based on the nature of the protein being characterized and knowledge regarding the structure and heterogeneity of the reference product and the proposed product, as well as those characteristics that are critical to product performance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.4379546642303467", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: The BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nAn exclusivity period for the first biological product determined to be interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use, during which a second or subsequent biological product may not be determined interchangeable with that reference product (see section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act)\n\nProcedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(l) of the PHS Act)\n\nTransition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously would have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below:\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class4 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010. Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term \u201cproduct class\u201d for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term \u201creference product\u201d means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)\") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\" provision\n\nFDA's Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s draft guidance for industry The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.5630764961242676"], "Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: VIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of \"Serving size,\" \"Calories,\" and the numerical value for \"Calories,\" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and \"Nutrition Facts\" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., \"Amount Per Serving\" and \"% Daily Value\") and footnotes (e.g., \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n\nIntermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, have different type size requirements. All information within the nutrition label must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). However, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than eight dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). Similarly, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)).\n\nThe footnote stating that the \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\" is required if the percent DV is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)). On labels of products represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, the footnote statement must read: \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet\" if the % Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)).\n\nIf there is inadequate space to list the required information vertically, the list may be split. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent DV information given to the left (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). The column headings are also repeated (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). Figure 17 reflects this label formatting.\n\nIX When Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nIf you have $10 million or more in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2020. If you have less than $10 million in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2021.\n\nIf you manufacture single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, or other pure sugars and syrups, as well as the cranberry products discussed in the Final Guidance (Ref. 1), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2021, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label rule and the Serving Size rule.\n\nIf you manufacture certain dried cranberry products with added flavorings (Ref. 11), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2020, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule.\n\nX Why Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nFailure to comply with the final rule will render the covered food misbranded under section 403(q) of the FD&C Act and potentially other sections as well. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is misbranded constitutes a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act. Among potential consequences, committing a prohibited act can result in injunction and/or seizure (see sections 302 and 304 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 332 and 334)).\n\nFigure 17: Supplement Facts Label \u2013 Split List (101.36(e)(12))\n\nXI References\n\nThe following references are on display at the Dockets Management Staff ((HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852) and are available for viewing by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday; they are also available electronically at https://www.regulations.gov.

The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

Are there special requirements that I must follow for the labeling of dietary supplements for children? Yes. On products for children less than 2 years of age, other than infant formula, you must not declare calories from fat, calories from saturated fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and cholesterol. Also, on products for children less than 4 years of age, you may not include % DVs for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, or potassium.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2228356897830963", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Figure 8: Tabular Display\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]\n\n11.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe third modification is the use of abbreviations, as listed in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B). We now allow for the following additional abbreviations on labels for small and intermediate-sized packages: \"vitamin\" may be abbreviated as \"Vit.,\" \"potassium\" may be abbreviated as \"Potas.,\" and \"Includes\" may be abbreviated as \"Incl.\" These abbreviations will further conserve label space. In addition, we allow the abbreviations of \"Total carb.\" and \"Incl.\" to be used on dual-column display labels (see section VIII.D).\n\n3.3 What Type Size Must be Used for the Declaration of Calories on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nThe numeric value for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 14 point, and the word \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.4 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages Differ from the Standard Label Version?\n\nThe \" -- servings per container\" declaration immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading, as in the standard label version; however, it must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). If a linear display is used, then the actual number of servings (i.e., \"Servings\" as shown in Fig 10) may be listed instead of the servings per container declaration.\n\nThe declaration of \"Serving size,\" which follows below the \" -- servings per container\" or \"servings\" declaration, is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages. See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n11.3.5 Is the \"% Daily Value*\" Footnote Required on Foods in Small and Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nFor products in small and intermediate-sized packages that qualify for the use of the tabular or linear format as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), there is no longer a requirement to place an asterisk, followed by the statement \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,\" at the bottom of the label if the footnote corresponding to \"% Daily Value\" is omitted. If \"Daily Value\" is not spelled out in the heading, then an asterisk can be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement \"% DV = % Daily Value\" in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.6 VIII.D How Do I Comply with the Nutrition Labeling Formatting Requirements when Dual Column Labeling is Required or Provided Voluntarily?\n\nDual column labeling is required under certain conditions, and can be used in other situations. In the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 9003), we announced the availability of a separate Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That CanReasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry,\" which, among other topics, discusses a new requirement regarding the use of dual-column labeling (Ref. [9]). In the Federal Register of December 31, 2019 (84 FR 72230), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Sizes-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics.\" This final guidance also discusses formatting issues for dual-column labeling (Ref. [10]).\n\nRegarding specific formatting for dual column labeling, the final rule updates certain requirements. Directly following the serving size declarations, each column of nutrition information must contain a heading that accurately describes why a dual column is being utilized. For example, a product may provide nutrition information for two different RDI groups, like in Figure 11 below. A product may also provide nutrition information for two different forms of the same food (e.g., \"Per 1/4 cup mix\" and \"Per prepared portion\"), as in Figure 12 below (21 CFR 101.9(e)). The quantitative information by weight and percent DV must be presented for each column, and the columns are to be separated by vertical lines (21 CFR 101.9(e)(3)). Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals must be separated from the information on other nutrients by a bar and be arrayed vertically in the required order (21 CFR 101.9(e)(4)). Note that the \"Amount per serving\" statement is not required for the dual column formats (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)). See Figures 11 through 15 (see also 21 CFR 101.9(e)(5) and (e)(6)(i)).\n\nFigure 11: Dual Column Display for 2 different RDI Groups (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 12: Dual Columns, Two Forms of the Same Food (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 13: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Container (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15 shows the use of dual columns in a tabular display format for products. As mentioned above, \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, and the numeric amount for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). \"Serving size\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point; however, the \" - servings per container\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, as with the standard label version (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i) and (ii)). \"Amount per serving\" is not required (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)).\n\nVIIILE When Can the Simplified Format Be Used?\n\nYou can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). For foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, you can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total\n\nFigure 14: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Unit (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15: Tabular Dual Column Display (101.9(e)(6)(ii))\n\ncarbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). The definition of \"insignificant amount\" has not changed.\n\nThe footnote requirement which states, \"Not a significant source of (\\underline{\\ })\" (listing the name(s) of any nutrients listed in this paragraph that are present in insignificant amounts) still exists (21 CFR 101.9(f)(4)). While the full \"% Daily Value\" footnote (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)) is not required for the simplified format, the column header \"% Daily Value\" can be abbreviated as \"% DV.\" If this abbreviation is used, then an asterisk must be placed at the end of the abbreviation and the corresponding footnote must read, \"% DV = % Daily Value\" (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). No footnote is required if \"Daily Value\" is spelled out in the column header (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). Figure 16 displays an example of a simplified format label.\n\nVIIILF Are Foods in Small Packages with a Total Surface Area Available to Bear Labeling of Less than 12 Square Inches Exempt from the Nutrition Facts Labeling Requirements?\n\nNot always. Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are not exempt from bearing a Nutrition Facts label if a nutrition claim or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)) is used or as outlined for covered vending machine food (see 21 CFR 101.8(c)). However, as previously allowed, if your product qualifies for and uses the exemption (i.e., claims or other nutrition information are not presented on the label or in labeling or advertising), then you must list an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)(A)).\n\nVIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of \"Serving size,\" \"Calories,\" and the numerical value for \"Calories,\" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and \"Nutrition Facts\" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., \"Amount Per Serving\" and \"% Daily Value\") and footnotes (e.g., \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.873632550239563", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure/Function Claims\n\nJANUARY 2002\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA's good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency's current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called \"health claims.\"\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn't a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is \"protective against the development of cancer\" or \"reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis\" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are \"relieves crushing chest pain (angina),\" \"improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),\" or \"relief of bronchospasm (asthma).\"\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don't use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman's terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.070096492767334", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals: Guidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n240-402-1450\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It provides questions and answers on topics related to compliance with our final rules issued on May 27, 2016, entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (81 FR 33742; the \"Nutrition Facts label final rule\") and \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments\" (81 FR 34000; the \"serving size final rule\") (codified at title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 101 (21 CFR part 101)). This guidance also discusses labeling of added sugars, as well as formatting for lines (e.g. thickness of lines) and leading (e.g. space between lines) in the examples of graphics used by FDA on the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn this guidance, \"you\" (or \"I\") refers to a manufacturer of conventional food or dietary supplements.\n\nII Background\n\nOn May 27, 2016, we published the Nutrition Facts label and the serving size final rules related to the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, which amended our labeling regulations for foods to provide updated nutrition information to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.\n\nBelow is a summary of the combined major provisions of the Nutrition Facts label final rule and serving size final rule.\n\nThe final rules revise the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels by:\n\nRemoving the declaration of \"Calories from fat\";\n\nRequiring the declaration of the gram (g) amount of \"added sugars\" in a serving of a product, establishing a Daily Reference Value (DRV) for added sugars, and requiring the percent Daily Value (DV) declaration for added sugars;\n\nChanging \"Sugars\" to \"Total Sugars\" and requiring that \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" be indented and declared directly below \"Total Sugars\";\n\nUpdating the list of vitamins and minerals of public health significance;\n\nUpdating certain reference values used in the declaration of percent DVs of nutrients on the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels;\n\nRevising the format of the Nutrition Facts labels to increase the prominence of the declaration of \"Calories\";\n\nRemoving the requirement for the footnote table listing the reference values for certain nutrients for 2,000 and 2,500 calorie diets;\n\nRequiring the maintenance of records to support the declarations of certain nutrients under specified circumstances;\n\nAmending the definition of a single-serving container;\n\nRequiring dual-column labeling for certain packages;\n\nAmending several reference amounts customarily consumed that are used by manufacturers to determine their label serving size; and * Establishing an effective date of July 26, 2016, and a compliance date of January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2018) and January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2019).2 Footnote 2: On October 2, 2017, FDA issued a proposed rule that would extend the compliance dates to January 1, 2020 (i.e., for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales) and January 1, 2021 (i.e., for manufacturers with less than $10 million in food sales) (82 FR 45753). We finalized the changes to the compliance date in the Federal Register of May 4, 2018 (83 FR 19619).\n\nIII. Questions and Answers on Compliance Issues\n\nMust the updated Nutrition or Supplement Facts label appear on all foods sold by the applicable compliance date? After publication of the final rule, we included a frequently asked question on our website asking \"When must the label be displayed on food packages?\" In our response, we stated that the revised labels were to be displayed on food products that are initially introduced into interstate commerce on or after the compliance date, and said we would address the issue further in guidance. We received a number of questions about products at various points in the distribution chain and whether the product would need to bear the new version of the Nutrition or Supplement Facts label. After further consideration, we are providing the following guidance. Products that are labeled (i.e., when the label is placed on the product) on or after the applicable compliance date must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36. Products that are labeled before the applicable compliance date do not need to be in compliance with the new labeling requirements, and therefore, do not need to bear the new nutrition label. We consider the date the food product was labeled for purposes of determining whether the product must bear a nutrition label that meets the new requirements. We would not consider the location of the food in the distribution chain to determine whether a food product must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements. For example, the food product, whether labeled before or after the compliance date, may be at the manufacturing facility awaiting distribution, at a warehouse awaiting further distribution, in transit to the United States to be offered for import, or on the store shelf of a U.S. retail establishment. We do not object to the use of a sticker for providing a revised nutrition label that meets our new requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 before new packaging is printed. The sticker label should not cover any other mandatory information and should adhere to the package during normal handling.\n\nWhen determining whether labels need to be in compliance with the new requirements, should the determination as to whether my company has $10 million or more in annual food sales be based on domestic food sales or total food sales, including international sales, and how many years of sales should I consider? To determine whether a company has $10 million or more in annual food sales, a firm can either take the smallest sales volume from the previous three years (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015), or alternately the firm can take the average of the previous three years sales volume. A firm's total (domestic plus international) food sales best reflects the firm's resources and, thus, ability to comply with the final rules by the applicable compliance date.\n\nAre there certain approved companies or nutrition databases that manufacturers can use to get the nutrition values for their products? FDA does not approve nutrition databases. However, the United States Department of Agriculture provides nutrition information for a number of foods, and there are also several commercially available nutrition databases you can use to determine nutrition values for your products.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.382547855377197"], "Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study.

(3.6)": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. What are \"data to support a rationale for the combination study\"? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: For combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n\nCombination genotoxicity, safety pharmacology, or carcinogenicity studies generally are not recommended to support clinical trials or marketing if the individual agents have been tested according to current standards. In those cases where the patient population includes WOCBP and studies with the individual agent(s) have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk, combination studies are not recommended as a potential human developmental hazard has already been identified. If nonclinical embryo-fetal studies have indicated that neither agent poses a potential human developmental risk, combination studies are not recommended unless concerns exist, based on the properties of individual components, that their combination could give rise to a hazard for humans. In circumstances when the individual agents have been tested in embryo-fetal studies but embryo-fetal studies of the drug combination are warranted, the study(ies) of the combination should be available to support the marketing application.\n\nXviii. Continuing efforts to improve harmonization (18)\n\nIt is recognized that significant advances in harmonization of the timing of nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials for pharmaceuticals have already been achieved and are detailed in this guidance. However, differences remain in a few areas. Regulators and industry will continue to consider these differences and work towards further improving the drug development process.\n\nXix Endnotes (19)\n\nNote 1: In this document, exposure generally means group mean AUC. In some circumstances (e.g., if the compound or compound class is known to produce acute functional cardiovascular changes or central nervous system-related clinical signs), it might be appropriate to base the exposure margin on group mean Cmax values rather than AUC.\n\nNote 2: An assessment of male and female fertility by thorough standard histopathological examination on the testis and ovary in a repeated-dose toxicity study (generally rodent) of at least 2-week duration is considered to be as sensitive as fertility studies in detecting toxic effects on male and female reproductive organs (Refs. 3, 15, 16).\n\nNote 3: Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed.\n\nNote 4: A preliminary embryo-fetal study useful for this purpose is one with adequate dose levels; that includes assessment of fetal survival, body weight, and external and visceral examinations; that uses a minimum of six dams per group; and that has dams treated over the period of organogenesis. This preliminary nonclinical study should be conducted under high-quality scientific standards with data collection records readily available or under GLP conditions.\n\nNote 5: The pregnancy rate of women initially attempting to become pregnant is (\\sim)17 percent per menstrual cycle. Pregnancy rates estimated from phase 3 studies conducted in WOCBP were observed to be (<)0.1 percent per menstrual cycle. During these studies, subjects were encouraged to avoid pregnancy and measures were instituted to prevent pregnancy. Survey information from earlier phase 2 studies suggests that the pregnancy rates were lower than in phase 3 studies but the extent of further reduction could not be estimated due to the limited number of women enrolled. Based on the above phase 3 experience, phase 2 trials enrolling 150 WOCBP for 3 months are estimated to result in significantly less than 0.5 pregnancies per pharmaceutical under development.\n\nNote 6: Testing for photocarcinogenicity in rodents using currently available models (e.g., hairless rodent) is not considered useful in support of pharmaceutical development and generally is not recommended. If the phototoxicity assessment suggests a potential photocarcinogenic risk and an appropriate assay becomes available, the study should usually be completed before marketing and the results should be considered in the human risk assessment.\n\nReferences (20)\n\n[1] ICH S6 Safety Studies for Biotechnological Products\n\n[2] ICH E8 General Considerations for Clinical Trials\n\n[3] ICH S5(R2) Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products and Toxicity to Male Fertility\n\n[4] ICH S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals\n\n[5] ICH S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals\n\n[6] ICH S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of QT Interval Prolongation\n\n[7] ICH S3A Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies\n\n[8] National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research.

Sponsors should also ensure that the performance characteristics of the syringe are maintained throughout the shelf life. Sponsors should consider in-use testing.\n\nNonclinical Development\n\nNonclinical development of anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in the following guidance documents:\n\nICH guidance for industry S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals (March 2010) (ICH S9)\n\nICH guidance for industry S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals: Questions and Answers (June 2018)\n\nICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (May 2012) (ICH S6(R1))\n\nGuidance for industry Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations (May 2019)\n\nSponsors should include pharmacology studies supporting the proposed trial with the initial IND. It is important for sponsors to test the formulation in an animal model for dose finding and chemistry and manufacturing consistency before initiating clinical trials.5 In general, sponsors should provide nonclinical, general toxicology studies in rodents and nonrodents of up to 1 month's duration to support early clinical development, and they should provide studies of 3 months' duration to support pivotal registration trials. Safety pharmacology and toxicokinetic endpoints can be included in these studies rather than using stand-alone studies. The general toxicology studies should use a route of administration similar to the route of administration in the intended clinical trial and should follow the recommendations described in Table 1 of ICH S9. Consistent with ICH S6(R1), if the 1-month studies show a consistent toxicological profile, then a 3-month study in a single species may be sufficient. Because GnRH analogues are peptides with expected high specificity, secondary pharmacology studies are usually not warranted.\n\nFootnote 5: We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) for animal use in testing when feasible. FDA encourages sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering a nonanimal testing method believed to be suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. FDA will consider if the alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nConsistent with the FDA guidance on reproductive testing for oncology pharmaceuticals, no embryo-fetal toxicology study or other reproductive toxicology study is needed to support the indication of advanced prostate cancer (see ICH S9, ICH S6(R1), and guidance for industry Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations). Unless there are unnatural amino acids (i.e., amino acids not normally found in mammals) in the GnRH product, the sponsor does not need to evaluate genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.\n\nIn general, it is not necessary to evaluate phototoxicity or immunotoxicity to support developing or marketing GnRH analogues to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nRegistrational Trial Considerations\n\n3.3.1 Trial Design\n\nSingle-arm trials using T levels as pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers are conducted to support the approval of GnRH analogues. These trials should demonstrate the following:\n\nAttainment of a castrate (less than 50 nanogram (ng)/deciliter (dL)) T level\n\nMaintenance of castrate T levels until the end of a dosing interval\n\nMaintenance of castrate T levels immediately after subsequent doses of the study drug product\n\nTo demonstrate these effects of the study drug product on T levels, the treatment period should be at least twice as long as the dosing interval. For drug products that act over a relatively short period (e.g., 1 month), the treatment period should extend over several (three to four) dosing intervals.\n\nSponsors should discuss with the division randomized designs intended to support comparative claims (efficacy and/or safety) among GnRH analogues.\n\n3.3.2 Trial Population\n\nParticipants enrolled in trials intended to support an indication for treating advanced prostate cancer should have normal T levels and either metastatic or biochemically recurrent disease. Sponsors could consider excluding participants with bone metastases in weight-bearing bone who are at risk for developing symptoms associated with T flare. We recommend that sponsors record information concerning the participant's history of prostate cancer, including the date of diagnosis, current stage, extent of metastatic disease at baseline, and prior therapies.\n\n3.3.3 Dose Selection\n\nThe study drug product dose used in the clinical trial should be informed by nonclinical testing. Sponsors should consider using early dose-finding studies or enrolling participants at multiple dose levels in the registrational trial. The adequacy of data for the selected dose for the new drug product will be assessed based on one or more clinical trials that demonstrate an adequate bridge to support the ability to rely on the safety and effectiveness of the listed drug for the new drug product.\n\n3.3.4 Trial Procedures and Timing of Assessments\n\nGnRH agonists are expected to achieve castrate T levels by Day 28, and T levels should be measured at this time. GnRH antagonists are expected to achieve more rapid development of castrate T levels than GnRH agonists. To document when castrate T levels occur, sponsors should consider weekly assessment of T levels until Day 28. Although the final analyses shoulduse T levels assessed at a central laboratory, T levels should also be assessed at local laboratories so that participants who do not have castrate T levels (on or after Day 28) can be promptly removed from the trial for safety reasons.\n\nTo ensure that castrate T levels are maintained over the dosing interval, sponsors developing GnRH agonists or antagonists should measure T levels before each dose of the study drug product. Sponsors could consider additional measurement of T levels at other time points, including the midpoint of the dosing interval, to help guide further drug product development if the predose level fails to show castrate T levels.\n\nTo assess for potential T surges following subsequent doses of a GnRH agonist, sponsors should obtain T levels at 1 hour, 4 hours, and 3 days after subsequent doses in all trial participants and provide these results as supportive efficacy data. Sponsors could consider an additional T measurement between 3 and 7 days after the additional dose. Sponsors should justify and discuss the appropriateness of the timing of T-level assessments with FDA before initiating the study.\n\nWe recommend that sponsors assess the effect of the study drug product on tumors by measuring prostate specific antigen at a central laboratory and reviewing bone scans and scans of known sites of disease (e.g., computed tomography (CT) scans). For participants with metastatic disease, tumor measurements would normally be obtained every 3 to 6 months during the treatment period, and we recommend that these results be included in the application database.\n\nSponsors should collect information on the dates of use and dose of herbal medications and dietary supplements, if they were used, at trial entry and throughout the treatment period because some herbal or alternative medications may affect T levels. Sponsors should also provide participants with a list of medications that they should not use during the trial period.\n\nAdverse event collection should solicit events using open-ended questions and known adverse events for this class of drugs, such as hot flushes, breast pain, bone pain, difficulty sleeping, and injection site reactions. After collecting data on injection site reactions, sponsors should report all terms related to this concept (e.g., injection site swelling, redness, pain) under a single term. The incidence of injection site reactions has varied markedly between trials, and this may be related to a lack of uniformity in ascertainment and assessment. Sponsors should assess adverse events throughout the treatment period and for 30 days after the end of the dosing interval. For example, sponsors should assess adverse events for 4 months after the last dose of a 3-month formulation of a GnRH analogue.\n\nSafety monitoring should include measurement of hemoglobin A1C and a lipid panel at screening and at the end of treatment, at minimum. Multiple trials have demonstrated an association between GnRH agonist use and adverse effects on insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.6 If the treatment period exceeds 1 year, these tests should be repeated annually. If the treatment period exceeds 2 years, bone density should also be measured at baseline and every 2 years.\n\nBefore trial initiation, sponsors should discuss with the division the potential use of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) to support labeling claims.7\n\nFootnote 7: See the guidance for industry Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims(December 2009) and the draft guidance for industry Core Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cancer Clinical Trials(June 2021).

What are \"data to support a rationale for the combination study\"? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: Scope of the Guideline\n\nThis addendum does not alter the scope of the original ICH S6 Guideline. For biotechnology-derived products intended to be used in oncology the Guidance on Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmacoeticals (ICH S9 Guideline) should be consulted.\n\n2 Species Selection\n\nGeneral Principles\n\nA number of factors should be taken into account when determining species relevancy. Comparisons of target sequence homology between species can be an appropriate starting point, followed by in vitro assays to make qualitative and quantitative cross-species comparisons of relative target binding affinities and receptor/ligand occupancy and kinetics.\n\nAssessments of functional activity are also recommended. Functional activity can be demonstrated in species-specific cell-based systems and/or in vivo pharmacology or toxicology studies. Modulation of a known biologic response or of a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker can provide evidence for functional activity to support species relevance.\n\nConsideration of species differences in target binding and functional activity in the context of the intended dosing regime should provide confidence that a model is capable of demonstrating potentially adverse consequences of target modulation. When the target is expressed at very low levels in typical healthy preclinical species (e.g., inflammatory cytokines or tumour antigens), binding affinity and activity in cell-based systems can be sufficient to guide species selection.\n\nAssessment of tissue cross reactivity in animal tissues is of limited value for species selection (see Note 1). However, in specific cases (i.e., where the approaches described above cannot be used to demonstrate a pharmacologically relevant species) tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies can be used to guide selection of toxicology species by comparison of tissue binding profiles in human and those animal tissues where target binding is expected.\n\nAs described in ICH S6 Guideline, when no relevant species can be identified because the biopharmaceutical does not interact with the orthologous target in any species, use of homologous molecules or transgenic models can be considered.\n\nFor monoclonal antibodies and other related antibody products directed at foreign targets (i.e., bacterial, viral targets etc.), a short-term safety study (see ICH S6 Guideline) in one species (choice of species to be justified by the sponsor) can be considered; no additional toxicity studies, including reproductive toxicity studies, are appropriate. Alternatively, when animal models of disease are used to evaluate proof of principle, a safety assessment can be included to provide information on potential target-associated safety aspects. Where this is not feasible, appropriate risk mitigation strategies should be adopted for clinical trials.\n--------------------\nContext title: S6_R1_Guideline_0\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5524353981018066", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. What are \"data to support a rationale for the combination study\"? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 6: See the ICH guidance for industry E3 Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports.\n\nThe listing should be followed by concise descriptions of all completed well-controlled studies, whether or not they supported effectiveness. For each study, critical design features and important results should be briefly described, including the prospectively identified endpoints and planned statistical analyses. Similar studies can be described together, but the individual study results should be provided. These brief study descriptions should include references or electronic links to the full study reports. Each study presentation should provide enough detail to understand critical aspects of the study design and the study findings, including (as applicable) treatments compared, sample size, population studied, number and location of study sites, study drug dose and regimen, treatment duration, and results for primary and important secondary endpoints. In all cases, the observed results and estimates of effect (e.g., mean change from baseline on drug and placebo for blood pressure, progression-free survival for treatment and control arms in oncology studies, percent responders, hazard ratios), as well as confidence intervals and p-values should be provided.\n\nAnalysis of Study Designs\n\nThis section should include discussion and critique of the important design features of all studies that sought to assess effectiveness, irrespective of whether the data support or do not support a conclusion of effectiveness. To the extent possible, the important design features and the statistical methodologies used to analyze the results of the controlled studies that were intended to support effectiveness should be presented for the studies as a group. Important similarities and differences among studies should also be presented (e.g., design, population, dose, duration, endpoints). Individual study reports should discuss these matters in greater detail.\n\nExamples of these important design features are as follows (see ICH E3 for additional important study characteristics):\n\nImportant inclusion and exclusion criteria that define the study population, for example:\n\nDisease characteristics (e.g., severity, duration)\n\nDemographic characteristics\n\nPrior and concomitant illnesses\n\nTreatment allowed, required, or not permitted\n\nPotential differences between the population(s) included in effectiveness studies and the overall patient population expected to receive the drug when it is marketed (e.g., exclusion of patients over 75 years old in studies of a drug for a disease common in the elderly).\n\nType of control7 Footnote 7: See 21 CFR 314.126.\n\nNo treatment\n\nSpecific treatments (e.g., dose, frequency) used in each group.\n\nDescription of how concomitant treatment was chosen, if allowed for the disease or condition under study. For example, was it left to investigator choice? Were there any limitations? Were particular treatments required in both groups? Any differences in permitted concomitant therapies between treatment groups should be noted.\n\nDescription of particular ancillary treatments (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, drugs to manage hypertension) if required, encouraged, discouraged, or proscribed, and, where appropriate, the reasons for the treatments.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nBasis for choice of active control treatments, with particular attention to selection of the active control used in noninferiority designs, choice of noninferiority margin,8 and support for the constancy assumption (i.e., the reason to believe that the effect of the active control drug in the present study is likely to have been similar to its effect in past studies). Footnote 8: See the draft guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nChoice of endpoints (primary and secondary), with particular attention to the validity of surrogate endpoints and novel clinical or patient assessments.\n\nUse of adjudication committees to assess endpoints.\n\nStudy duration; treatment duration.\n\nUse of blinding, specific methods of blinding, and potential weaknesses (e.g., tablet enclosed in a capsule, odor of the study drug).\n\nDosage selection and assessment of dose-response. Dose-response designs can include randomized fixed-dose dose-response, forced titration, and optional titration.9 If the fixed-dose study had a titration phase or allowed upward or downward titration, this should be described. Footnote 9: See the ICH guidance for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration.\n\nRandomization (e.g., stratified, nonstratified, allocation ratios).\n\nUse of enrichment approaches10 to identify subjects with high likelihood of events (prognostic enrichment) or high likelihood of response (predictive enrichment), including randomized withdrawal design (a type of predictive enrichment). Any pharmacogenomic or proteomic assessments used in enrichment should be described. Footnote 10: See the draft guidance for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration.\n\nUse of other enrichment maneuvers (e.g., placebo run-in, means of encouraging compliance, exclusion of subjects with high baseline variability, use of less variable measurements, retention strategies).\n\nAdaptive features.11 Footnote 10: See the draft guidance for industry Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nUse of a data monitoring committee and its specific responsibilities.\n\n2.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPlanned endpoints, including primary endpoint(s) and secondary endpoint(s)\n\nPrespecified plans for statistical analyses, including:\n\nPlanned analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint\n\nPlanned sequential analyses\n\nAnalysis population (e.g., intent-to-treat, per protocol, as treated), with specific definitions\n\nMethods for handling missing data\n\nMethods of controlling type I error rate within studies when more than one endpoint or subpopulation is analyzed\n\nPlanned interim analyses\n\nImportant changes in study design made after the start of the study, noting whether they were made before or after study unblinding\n\nChange of primary endpoints during conduct of trial\n\nDropping or adding treatment arms\n\nChanges in inclusion and/or exclusion criteria\n\nSample size modification\n\nPlanned adaptive features\n\nOverall Analysis of Effectiveness Results\n\nThe term integrated analysis refers to using all relevant data from controlled trials, as well as other sources (e.g., clinical pharmacology trials), to enhance the understanding of the overall evidence of effectiveness. Integrated analyses include both close examination of individual study results and, when appropriate, combined quantitative analyses (pooled analyses). The integrated analysis is not a substitute for the analysis of individual studies. Instead, it is intended to provide a clearer understanding of responses across studies, different populations (e.g., demographic, disease-related), and dosing regimens. Differences in responses among studies should be described.\n\nThis section of the ISE should provide a comprehensive, integrated, in-depth analysis of the overall effectiveness results, with a rationale for the methods used in the analysis. All studies that sought to assess effectiveness should be included, irrespective of whether the data support, or do not support, a conclusion of effectiveness. The extent to which the results of the relevant studies reinforce or do not reinforce each other should be discussed.\n\nThe individual studies that are considered adequate and well-controlled investigations and that demonstrate the effect of the drug should be identified.

The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product's standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a \"2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for packages and in a \"linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using \"human-readable or machine-readable methods.\"11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled \"Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,\" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency's thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A \"product\" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a \"prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.\"\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of \u201ctransaction\u201d (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a \"product\" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining \u201cproduct.\u201d\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of \u201cproduct\u201d under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered \u201cradioactive drugs\u201d or \u201cradioactive biological products\u201d, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: \u00a7 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA\u2019s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA's view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, \u201cSubmission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,\u201d on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA's initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated \"May Proceed\" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA's timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA's website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2014 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019). For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIX Other Requirements applicable to an MMA product\n\nAn MMA product is subject to all relevant requirements of applicable statutes, including those implemented by FDA such as the FD&C Act and the PHS Act; applicable implementing regulations under those authorities; and other relevant statutes, including the Social Security Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and the Controlled Substances Act. The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: \"Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry\" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018).

Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3508355617523193", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProceduralProduct Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -\n\nCompliance Policy\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are availablefrom:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{\\text{th}}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drug/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: (ocod)@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers \"affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce\" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms \u201chomogeneous\u201d and \u201chomogenous\u201d are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term \u201chomogenous\u201d throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product's standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA's draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for \"products,\" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. \"Prescription drugs\" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of \"labeling\" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant's annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., \"lot number\" and \"expiration date\") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3506312072277069", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n\nDispensers should refer to the Verification Systems Draft Guidance for a detailed description of responsibilities that are applicable to them, as the compliance policy described in this section applies only to the dispenser requirements regarding verification of product identifiers described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act and does not apply to any other provision in section 582 of the FD&C Act. This compliance policy does not address any of the other verification requirements set forth in section 582(d)(4) of the FD&C Act. For example, this compliance policy does not affect the requirement that as of November 27, 2020, a dispenser may engage in transactions involving a product only if such product is encoded with a product identifier (except as provided pursuant to section 582(a)(5) of the FD&C Act),29 and this compliance policy does not affect the other activities required by section 582(d)(4)(A) and section 582(d)(4)(B) by incorporation (e.g., dispensers must still quarantine product, conduct investigations, and disposition illegitimate product). This compliance policy does not relieve a manufacturer of its verification obligations pursuant to section 582(b)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act upon receiving a request for verification from an authorized dispenser.\n\nFootnote 29: See section 582(d)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis compliance policy aligns with the statutory requirements for an enhanced drug distribution system discussed above in section III of this guidance. When effective on November 27, 2023,the enhanced system must include as part of the transaction information the product identifier for each package in the transaction.30 The enhanced system must also allow for the verification of product at the package level.31 In addition, the enhanced system must allow for the ability to promptly generate and provide specific product and transaction documentation upon request by FDA, another Federal or State official, or an authorized trading partner for purposes of investigating suspect or illegitimate product.32 FDA believes that dispensers can use this 3-year period to ensure the systems and processes that are put into place to meet the enhanced system requirements by November 27, 2023, will also fulfill all dispenser verification requirements under section 582(d)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 582(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 31: See section 582(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 32: See section 582(g)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1241271495819092"], "Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations\n\nGuidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review\n\nBoards, and Food and Drug Administration Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on: August 19, 2014\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on June 14, 2013.\n\nFor questions for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health regarding this document, contact the Office of Device Evaluation, Office of the Director, Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) Staff at 301-796-5640.\n\nFor questions for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research regarding this document, contact the Office of Communication, Outreach and Development at 1-800-335-4709 or 240-402-7800.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n**Center for Devices and Radiological Health Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nYou may submit written comments and suggestions at any time for Agency consideration to the Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, (HFA-305), Rockville, MD, 20852.

In many cases, device development and evaluation include clinical investigation. This guidance document has been developed to facilitate the initiation of clinical investigations to evaluate medical devices under FDA's Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulations, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 812.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE submission allows the initiation of subject enrollment in a clinical investigation of a significant risk1 device. This guidance is intended to provide clarification regarding the regulatory implications of the decisions that FDA may render based on review of an IDE as well as a general explanation of the reasons for those decisions.\n\nFootnote 1: 21 CFR 812.3(m): A significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\n(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\n(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nand communication of outstanding issues related to the IDE through Study Design Considerations and Future Considerations, are described in this guidance.2\n\nFDA's decision-making for IDEs was modified with passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE because:\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not offer specific information related to the design of a clinical investigation, nor does this guidance discuss the specific content that should be provided in an IDE application. For additional information on those topics, please refer to FDA\u2019s regulations (21 CFR Part 812) and to FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance on IDE Policies and Procedures\u201d\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm080202.htm).\n\n(i): the investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device; (ii): the investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or (iii): an additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nHowever, the Agency recognizes that some IDE sponsors may wish to ensure that the pivotal study design may support a marketing application if it is successfully executed, meets its stated endpoints, and does not raise unforeseen safety concerns. Through mechanisms such as the Pre-Submission3 process, FDA wishes to work interactively with sponsors interested in addressing important limitations with such a study that might impair its ability to support a future marketing application.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 3: For more information, see FDA\u2019s Guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf\n\n2 IDE Decisions\n\nFDA's regulations4 provide for three FDA actions on IDE applications:\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.30.\n\nApproval5* Approval with Conditions6\n\nDisapproval\n\nFDA must inform the sponsor7 or sponsor-investigator8 of its decision, or must notify the sponsor that the investigation may not begin, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the IDE application, or the IDE application will be deemed approved. If an IDE application is approved or approved with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment, up to the number of subjects and investigational sites specified in FDA's decision letter, upon receipt of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which may occur prior to FDA approval.\n\nFootnote 6: As discussed in Section 5, enrollment for an IDE application that is Approved or Approved with Conditions may in some cases be limited to a portion of the total expected enrollment (i.e., \u201cStaged Approval\u201d) while certain outstanding questions are answered concurrently with enrollment in the clinical investigation.\n\nFootnote 7: FDA has traditionally referred to IDE approvals that have conditions as \u201cConditional Approvals.\u201d FDA believes that the term \u201cApproval with Conditions\u201d is more appropriate because the term conveys that the IDE has been approved and may begin without awaiting further FDA review.\n\nFootnote 8: 21 CFR 812.3(n): Sponsor means a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, that is, the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.\n\nFootnote 9: The term \u201capproval\u201d in this document and in FDA\u2019s communications means approval without conditions.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.251086711883545", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet Guidance For IBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n\nSignificant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice\n\nOffice of Special Medical Programs, Office of the Commissioner\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., WO32-5129\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-5129\n\n(Tel) (301)-796-8340\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126418.pdf\n\nor\n\nDivision of Small Manufacturers, International, and Consumer Assistance\n\nOffice of Communication, Education and Radiation Programs\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., WO66-4521\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\n\nTel: 1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100\n\ndsmica@fda.hhs.gov\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInformation Sheet Guidance\n\nFor IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors1\n\nSignificant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance document was developed by the Good Clinical Practice Program in coordination with the Agency Centers.\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

This document supersedes Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies (September 1998) Office of Health Affairs, Food and Drug Administration. This document was revised to update the list of examples of significant and nonsignificant risk devices, to clarify the IRB's responsibilities when making the risk determination for investigational medical devices, and to make the guidance consistent with the Agency's good guidance practices regulations (21 CFR 10.115).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812) describes three types of device studies: significant risk (SR), nonsignificant risk (NSR), and exempt studies. In this guidance, we discuss the two types of studies that are subject to the IDE regulation - the SR and NSR studies. For information on studies that are exempt from the IDE regulation, see the Information Sheet Guidance entitled, \"Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices.\"\n\nIII.SIGNIFICANT RISK AND NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK DEVICE STUDIES\n\nAppendix A What is a Significant Risk Device Study?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 812.3(m), an SR device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nB.What is a Nonsignificant Risk Device Study?\n\nAn NSR device study is one that does not meet the definition for an SR device study.\n\nAppendix C Who Decides Whether A Device Study is SR or NSR?\n\nSponsors are responsible for making the initial risk determination and presenting it to the IRB. FDA is also available to help the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB in making the risk determination.2\n\nFootnote 2: See the guidance entitled, \u201cProcedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices.\u201d This guidance may be found at:\n\nwww.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulatonandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm126598.\n\nUnless FDA has already made a risk determination for the study, the IRB must review the sponsor's SR or NSR determination for every investigational medical device study reviewed and modify the determination if the IRB disagrees with the sponsor. If FDA has already made the SR or NSR determination for the study, the agency's determination is final. FDA is available to help the IRB when making its risk determination. (Also, see section VII. \"How does an IRB document the SR or NSR determination?\")FDA is the final arbiter as to whether a device study is SR or NSR and makes the determination when an IDE is submitted to FDA or if asked by the sponsor, clinical investigator, or IRB. See 21 CFR SS 812.2(b)(1)\n\n4 What are the Major Differences Between SR And NSR Device Studies?\n\nThe major differences between SR and NSR studies are in the IDE approval process and in the sponsor's record keeping and reporting requirements, as outlined below.\n\nSignificant Risk (SR) Device Studies\n\nSR device studies must follow all the IDE regulations at 21 CFR 812.\n\nSR device studies must have an IDE application approved by FDA before they may proceed.\n\nNonsignificant Risk (NSR) Device Studies\n\nNSR device studies must follow the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b).\n\nThese abbreviated requirements address labeling, IRB approval, informed consent, monitoring, records, reports, and prohibition against promotion. However, there is no need to make progress reports or final reports to FDA.\n\nNSR device studies do not have to have an IDE application approved by FDA.\n\nSponsors and IRBs do not have to report the IRB approval of an NSR device study to FDA. This means that an IRB may approve an NSR device study and an investigator may conduct the study without FDA knowing about it.\n\nAn IRB's NSR determination is important because the IRB serves as the FDA's surrogate for review, approval, and continuing review of the NSR device studies. An NSR device study may start at the institution as soon as the IRB reviews and approves the study and without prior approval by FDA.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SPONSOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN INITIATING A DEVICE STUDY?\n\n5 For Nonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\nIf the sponsor identifies a study as NSR, the sponsor must provide the reviewing IRB an explanation of its determination (21 CFR 812.2(b)(1)(ii)) and should provide any other information that may help the IRB in evaluating the risk of the study. For example, a description of the device, reports of prior investigations with the device, the proposed investigational plan, subject selection criteria, and other information the IRB may need.\n\nIf FDA has determined that the study is NSR, the sponsor should so inform the IRB. By providing such risk determination information to the IRB, the IRB's workload should be reduced and the review process should be facilitated.\n\nFor Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nThe sponsor must submit an IDE application to FDA and obtain the agency's approval of the study. (See 21 CFR 812.20(a)(1) and (2))\n\nThe sponsor must advise its clinical investigators about the SR status and obtain their agreement to comply with the applicable regulations governing such studies (i.e., 21 CFR Parts, 50, 56, 812) (See 21 CFR 812.43(c)(4)(i)). Sponsors should provide the IDE number and/or a copy of the IDE approval letter to the IRB when requested.\n\nSponsors may send their SR device study to an IRB for review before the IDE application is approved by FDA. However, FDA cautions that an SR device study may not begin until FDA approves the IDE.\n\nV What Are the IRB's responsibilities when it receives a device study for review?\n\nIRBs should have standard operating procedures that explain how the IRB makes SR and NSR determinations and that the decision should be documented. FDA considers this determination to be part of the IRB's responsibilities for conducting its initial review of a study. (See 21 CFR 56.108)\n\nIRBs should make the SR or NSR determination about a study by reviewing relevant information at a convened meeting. This information includes the description of the device, reports of prior investigations conducted with the device, the proposed investigational plan, and subject selection criteria. The sponsor should provide the IRB with a risk assessment and the rationale used in making its SR or NSR determination.\n\nAn IRB may agree or disagree with the sponsor's initial NSR assessment.\n\nIf the IRB determines the study is NSR, the IRB may approve the study using the criteria at 21 CFR 56.111. The study may begin without submission of an IDE application to FDA.\n\nIf the IRB disagrees with the sponsor's NSR assessment and decides the study is SR, the IRB must tell the clinical investigator, and where appropriate, the sponsor. (See 21 CFR 812.66)* An IRB may approve the study as an SR device study, but the study may not begin until FDA approves the sponsor's IDE application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.280928373336792", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFactors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nGuidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor- Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on January 13, 2017.\n\nThis guidance will have a 60 day implementation period.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on June 18, 2015.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Device Evaluation, Office of the Director, Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) Staff at 301-796-5640.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is committed to improving U.S. patient access to new devices by strengthening and streamlining the clinical trial enterprise so that medical device clinical trials are conducted in the U.S. in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining appropriate patient and research participant protections.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide greater clarity for FDA staff and investigational device exemption (IDE) sponsors and sponsor-investigators1 regarding the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing the benefits and risks of IDE applications for human clinical studies.\n\nConsistent with applicable laws and regulations, FDA may disapprove an IDE application if, among other reasons, \"[t]here is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained.\"2 In many cases, the Agency believes that effective risk management, including the application of risk controls, which includes risk mitigation measures, can result in a favorable IDE benefit-risk determination.\n\nFDA recognizes that in assessing risks and anticipated benefits, the medical device total product lifecycle should be considered, and that earlier stages of device development and investigational clinical study are typically associated with greater uncertainty (i.e., a lower level of evidence). A primary goal of this guidance is to clarify the factors that FDA considers when assessing risks and anticipated benefits as significant contributors to the decision to approve IDE studies, and how uncertainty may be offset by a variety of risk mitigation measures which can ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings. For proposed IDE studies, at earlier stages of device development, FDA considers appropriate mitigation measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages, FDA considers whether risk mitigation measures focus on the most probable risks.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\nAnother important goal of this guidance is to characterize benefits in the context of investigational research, which includes direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for evaluating marketing applications, FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting in which the study is being proposed, including but not limited to characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed, the availability of and risks associated with alternative treatments or diagnostics. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and their perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment. See for more information FDA Guidance, Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA believes use of this benefit-risk framework will facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. FDA envisions this will facilitate a common understanding between FDA and sponsors/sponsor-investigators by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors influence FDA's decisions. This guidance document will also help improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for IDE applications.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing benefits and risks of original IDE applications, IDE amendments and IDE supplements for human clinical investigations of certain medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness. The approach discussed in this guidance is applicable to studies subject to the IDE requirements in 21 CFR part 812, including postmarket studies. In general, IDE applications are required for clinical investigations of significant risk devices to determine safety and effectiveness.3 This guidance applies to both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This guidance is not intended to provide recommendations regarding device-specific data or study requirements.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7972300052642822", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: 21 CFR part 812.\n\nFootnote 17: See the guidance for sponsors, clinical investigators, IRBs, and FDA staff FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations (August 2014) and the guidance for IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors IRB Responsibilities for Reviewing the Qualifications of Investigators, Adequacy of Research Sites, and the Determination of Whether an IND/IDE is Needed (August 2013).\n\nSponsors interested in pursuing the development of a specific biomarker test for marketing as a device should consult the appropriate center at FDA (CDRH or CBER) responsible for review of the IVD.\n\nFootnote 18: See the draft guidance for industry, FDA staff, sponsors, and IRBs Investigational IVDs Used in Clinical Investigations of Therapeutic Products (December 2017).

The analysis plan should describe the futility analyses to be conducted. FDA recommends designs, such as the Simon two-stage design, that limit exposure to an ineffective drug (Simon 1989). However, other statistical approaches may be acceptable and, if proposed, should be described in detail in the SAP. If a sponsor anticipates that the results would form the basis of an efficacy claim in a marketing application, the clinical protocol and SAP should ensure that collected data are of adequate quality for this purpose. If preliminary results from a substudy or substudies suggest a major advance over available therapy, the sponsor should meet with the review division to discuss modifications to the protocol (e.g., to propose interim analyses for efficacy or consider early termination of the trial) or to modify the development program (e.g., discuss potential for breakthrough therapy designation).\n\nRandomized Designs\n\nIf a sponsor incorporates randomization into an umbrella trial design, FDA recommends use of a common control arm when possible. The general comments about generation of an appropriate SAP and information about futility analysis in the previous section (VII. A., Nonrandomized, Activity-Estimating Design) also apply to randomized trials. Before initiating the proposed substudy, the sponsor should meet with the division to discuss the SAP with regard to how the strength of evidence will be assessed and how potential sources of bias will be controlled.\n\nMaster Protocols Employing Adaptive/Bayesian Design\n\nIn master protocols that incorporate adaptive designs, the SAP should provide all information described in the guidances for industry Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics and Enrichment Strategies for Clinical Trials to Support Determination of Effectiveness of Human Drugs and Biological Products. The SAP should also describe plans for futility analyses.22 Master protocols can use a Bayesian statistical method or other methods for planning or modifying the sample size, dropping an arm, and other adaptive strategies. The SAP should include details on implementation of Bayesian or other methods.\n\nFootnote 22: See also the ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and the guidance for clinical trial sponsors Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees.\n\nMaster Protocols With Biomarker-Defined Subgroups\n\nIn master protocols with basket or complex design, where human subject assignment to a treatment arm is based on the presence of a specific biomarker of interest, the protocol should clearly specify how subjects with more than one biomarker of interest will be assigned tosubstudies. There are two approaches to making such assignments that FDA recommends from a clinical trial design perspective, but other approaches may also be appropriate. One approach is to prioritize biomarkers or treatments. For example, in the BATTLE-1 trial, investigators ranked the biomarker groups based on their predictive values and assigned human subjects with multiple biomarkers to the group for one of their biomarkers that has the highest predictive value (Kim et al. 2011). The other approach is based on a prespecified randomization ratio. For example, the Lung-MAP trial uses a reversed ratio of prevalence rates. Using reverse prevalence ratios, subjects in the trial with tumors that have biomarkers with low prevalence have a greater likelihood to be assigned to a substudy for the lower prevalence population.23 Consideration should be given to the clinical relevance, if any, of low-prevalence passenger mutations that coexist with driver mutations, for which adjustment to randomization may not be needed. Sponsors should provide justification for the selected approach and should state in the justification whether the proposed approach of assigning subjects with more than one biomarker of interest to a particular substudy would impact the prevalence of the biomarkers in each subpopulation and whether any statistical methods to address this potential issue/bias are needed.\n\nFootnote 23: See the guidance for industry Developing Targeted Therapies in Low-Frequency Molecular Subsets of a Disease (October 2018).\n\nVIII Safety Considerations\n\nSafety Monitoring and Reporting Plans\n\nThe sponsor of the master protocol IND is required to ensure proper monitoring of the investigations and to ensure that the investigations are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND (21 CFR 312.50).24 Similarly, the sponsor of the investigational product IND for a drug that will be administered under a master protocol IND is responsible for monitoring the safety of its drug and evaluating all accumulating safety data, including data from trials not conducted by the sponsor of the investigational product IND (21 CFR 312.32(b)). The sponsor of the master protocol IND should establish a systematic approach that ensures rapid communication of serious safety issues to all participating clinical investigators and FDA under IND safety reporting regulations.25 Additionally the master protocol IND sponsor should ensure rapid communication of serious safety issues to the sponsors of all products used in the master protocol, according to the established safety reporting plan. In addition, the approach should describe the process for rapid implementation of protocol amendments to address serious safety issues.26\n\nFootnote 24: See the guidance for industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations \u2014 A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring (August 2013).\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nSafety monitoring and reporting obligations of the sponsor of the master protocol IND and sponsors of each IND covered by the master protocol remain unchan\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThese reporting obligations are described, along with recommendations to help sponsors comply with expedited safety reporting requirements, in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities--Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies (June 2021).27\n\nFootnote 27: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nFor master protocols in oncology, FDA may expect a sponsor to conduct aggregate analyses of all SAEs at intervals based on the volume of safety data collected or based on the number of subjects accrued into the master protocol in order to fulfill its review obligations under 312.32(b). A sponsor would then be required to submit events that qualify for reporting under 312.32(c) and as described in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities--Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies. The frequency of the cumulative aggregate safety analyses should be discussed with the Agency at a pre-IND meeting, taking into account specific program needs.\n\nGiven the complexity of and the generally rapid accrual to these trials, resulting in increased risks to subjects should there be a failure to promptly identify suspected and unexpected serious adverse reactions, sponsors should select medical monitors who have training and experience in cancer research and in the conduct of clinical trials so that safety information can be promptly assessed.\n\nIndependent Safety Assessment\n--------------------\nContext title: Master Protocols- Efficient Clinical Trial Design Strategies to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4543483555316925", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n\nConsiderations When Transferring Clinical Investigation Oversight to Another IRB\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice\n\nMay 2014Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and\n\nSponsors\n\nConsiderations When Transferring Clinical Investigation Oversight to Another IRB\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nDivision of Drug Information, WO51-2201\n\nOffice of Communication\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave.\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-002\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nEmail: DRUGINFO@fda.hhs.gov\n\n(Tel) 301-796-3400; (Fax): 301-847-8714\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and\n\nDevelopment, HFM-40\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n1401 Rockville Pike\n\nRockville, MD 20852-1448\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/default.htm\n\nEmail: ocod@fda.hhs.gov\n\n(Tel) 800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800\n\nand/or\n\nDivision of Industry and Consumer Education, WO66-5429\n\nOffice of Communication, Education and Radiation Programs\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave.\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-002\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/default.htm\n\nEmail: DICE@cdrh.fda.gov\n\n(Tel) 800.638.2041 or 301- 796-7100\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice\n\nMay 2014Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance discusses the regulatory responsibilities of institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors when oversight of a previously approved, ongoing clinical investigation under FDA's jurisdiction is transferred from one IRB to another IRB. This guidance also addresses questions that have been previously raised concerning procedures and processes that are required and/or recommended by FDA when such oversight is transferred. FDA encourages individuals to contact the agency directly to discuss any unusual circumstances.\n\nTo enhance human subject protections and reduce regulatory burden, FDA and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) have been actively working to harmonize the agencies' regulatory requirements and guidance for human subjects research. This guidance document was developed as a part of these efforts. For studies subject to 45 CFR part 46 (i.e., studies that are funded, conducted, or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services), OHRP issued a draft guidance entitled, \"Considerations in Transferring a Previously Approved Research Project to a New IRB or Research Institution.\"2\n\nFootnote 2: OHRP\u2019s guidance is available at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/newsroom/rfc/transferdraftdoc.html.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\nsponsor in clinical investigations of medical devices.5 In practice, however, the party that actually initiates the transfer process varies depending on the circumstances necessitating the transfer and the parties involved. For example, an institution's IRB may decide to transfer oversight for its pediatric clinical investigations to an IRB with such expertise within the same institution. Whoever initiates the transfer of oversight, the clinical investigator and sponsor continue to be responsible for their respective regulatory obligations (e.g., making any modifications to the informed consent document required by the receiving IRB).6\n\nFootnote 5: 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nFootnote 6: See, e.g., 21 CFR 56.109, 21 CFR 312.66, and 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nAlthough FDA regulations at 21 CFR parts 50, 56, 312, and 812 do not specifically address the issue of transfer of oversight from one IRB to another, the requirements governing review, oversight, and conduct of clinical investigations apply nonetheless. While this guidance provides recommendations to facilitate such a transfer, it does not create or imply new requirements and/or responsibilities for IRBs, sponsors, or clinical investigators.\n\nTransfers of IRB oversight of a clinical investigation may occur for a number of different reasons, including cessation of IRB operations, consolidation of multiple IRBs into a single IRB, temporary inability of an IRB to meet its obligations, or as a result of IRB non-compliance. Specific examples include:\n\nA medical school decides to transfer oversight responsibility for a category of its clinical investigations (e.g., drug research, device research) to another IRB.\n\nA hospital's IRB realizes it has an excessive workload, but the institution does not want to establish an additional IRB and transfers oversight of some clinical investigations to another IRB.\n\nA large multi-campus university decides to consolidate its human subject protection system by closing one or more of its existing IRBs and transfers oversight to an independent IRB.\n\nA small institution has an insufficient number of clinical investigations to justify maintaining its own IRB and decides to cease operations of its IRB and transfer oversight of its clinical investigations to another IRB.\n\nA sponsor decides to transfer IRB oversight from one IRB to another.\n\nFinancial or other considerations cause an IRB to cease operations.\n\nAn institution realizes its current IRBs are overburdened and establishes another IRB to share the workload.\n\nA fire, flood, or other disaster temporarily prevents an IRB from fulfilling its review/oversight responsibilities.\n\nAn IRB is subject to administrative actions under 21 CFR 56.120 or has been disqualified under 21 CFR 56.121.7 Footnote 7: 21 CFR 56.121(b) provides that an IRB may be disqualified if FDA determines that the IRB has refused or repeatedly failed to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements and the noncompliance adversely affects the rights or welfare of the human subjects in a clinical investigation.\n\nA sponsor decides to transfer a clinical investigation when an investigator moves to a new research site.\n\nThe complexity and duration of the IRB transfer process itself is expected to vary, depending on the reasons for the transfer, the parties involved, and the number and risk of the studies being transferred. For example, transfer of IRB oversight due to purely administrative reasons such as consolidating IRB workload may be relatively quick and straight-forward, whereas a transfer of oversight due to the original IRB's non-compliance might be lengthier and involve more complicated legal, regulatory, administrative, and logistical considerations. In general, the type of IRBs involved (e.g., academic, hospital-based, independent) would not affect the steps to consider when transferring oversight.8\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations When Transferring Clinical Investigation Oversight to Another IRB Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.05425387993454933", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: If a clinical study is needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to obtaining 510(k) clearance of the device, the study should generally be conducted under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, 21 CFR 812. Generally, we believe PTA balloon catheters and specialty catheters addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of 21 CFR part 812. Please see the FDA guidance, \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.\"13 In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR part 812, sponsors of such trials must comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR part 50). When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States are submitted to FDA for PTA and specialty catheters, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply.14 21 CFR 812.28 outlines the conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations conducted outside the US when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more information, see the FDA guidance, \"Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.\"15\n\nFootnote 13: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/significant-risk-and-nonsignificant-risk-medical-device-studies\n\nFootnote 14: Applies to data from clinical investigations that began on or after February 21, 2019 and are submitted to support a premarket submission, including IDEs, PMAs, and 510(k)s.\n\nFootnote 15: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/acceptance-clinical-data-support-medical-device-applications-and-submissions-frequently-asked\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nIn some cases, \"real-world data\" (RWD) may be used to support expansion of the indication for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be required. For additional information regarding this topic, please refer to the FDA Guidance entitled \"Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices.\"16\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nAppendix J Labeling\n\nThe regulatory submission must include proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e) for premarket notifications. Labeling for PTA balloon catheters and specialty balloons should include all applicable information, including indications, contraindications, warnings, product information, a summary of the clinical data (if applicable), and directions for use.\n\nAs prescription devices, PTA balloon and specialty catheters are exempt from having adequate directions for lay use under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as long as the conditions in 21 CFR 801.109 are met. For instance, labeling must include adequate information for practitioner use of the device, including indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration (e.g., infusion time, inflation duration), and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR 801.109(d)).\n\nAppendix K Modifications\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device change or modification \"that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device\" or represents \"a major change or modification in the intended use of the device\" requires a new 510(k).17 The changes or modifications listed below are examples of changes that may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that are likely to require submission of a new 510(k). For additional details, please see FDA guidance \"Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.\"18\n\nFootnote 17: Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, Title III of Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (\u201cFDORA\u201d), enacted on December 29, 2022, added section 515C \u201cPredetermined Change Control Plans for Devices\u201d to the FD&C Act (section 515C). Under section 515C, FDA can approve or clear a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) for a device that describes planned changes that may be made to the device and that would otherwise require a supplemental premarket approval application or premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that a supplemental premarket approval application (section 515C(a)) or a premarket notification (section 515C(b)) is not required for a change to a device if the change is consistent with a PCCP that is approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides that FDA may require that a PCCP include labeling for safe and effective use of a device as such device changes pursuant to such plan, notification requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan, and performance requirements for changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your marketing submission, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH.

The following practices should ensure uniform collection and assessment of information about the process and enhance the accessibility of such information later in the product lifecycle.\n\nWe recommend an integrated team approach11 to process validation that includes expertise from a variety of disciplines (e.g., process engineering, industrial pharmacy, analytical chemistry, microbiology, statistics, manufacturing, and quality assurance). Project plans, along with the full support of senior management, are essential elements for success. Footnote 11: This concept is discussed in more detail in FDA\u2019s guidance for industry, Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory/Information/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, various studies can be initiated to discover, observe, correlate, or confirm information about the product and process. All studies should be planned and conducted according to sound scientific principles, appropriately documented, and approved in accordance with the established procedure appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle.\n\nThe terms attribute(s) (e.g., quality, product, component) and parameter(s) (e.g., process, operating, and equipment) are not categorized with respect to criticality in this guidance. With a lifecycle approach to process validation that employs risk based decision making throughout that lifecycle, the perception of criticality as a continuum rather than a binary state is more useful. All attributes and parameters should be evaluated in terms of their roles in the process and impact on the product or in-process material, and reevaluated as new information becomes available. The degree of control over those attributes or parameters should be commensurate with their risk to the process and process output. In other words, a higher degree of control is appropriate for attributes or parameters that pose a higher risk. The Agency recognizes that terminology usage can vary and expects that each manufacturer will communicate the meaning and intent of its terminology and categorization to the Agency.\n\nMany products are single-source or involve complicated manufacturing processes. Homogeneity within a batch and consistency between batches are goals of process validation activities. Validation offers assurance that a process is reasonably protected against sources of variability that could affect production output, cause supply problems, and negatively affect public health.\n\nStage 1 -- Process Design\n\nProcess design is the activity of defining the commercial manufacturing process that will be reflected in planned master production and control records. The goal of this stage is to design a process suitable for routine commercial manufacturing that can consistently deliver a product that meets its quality attributes.\n\nii.2.1 Building and Capturing Process Knowledge and Understanding\n\nGenerally, early process design experiments do not need to be performed under the CGMP conditions required for drugs intended for commercial distribution that are manufactured during Stage 2 (process qualification) and Stage 3 (continued process verification). They should, however, be conducted in accordance with sound scientific methods and principles, including good documentation practices. This recommendation is consistent with ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System.12 Decisions and justification of the controls should be sufficiently documented and internally reviewed to verify and preserve their value for use or adaptation later in the lifecycle of the process and product.\n\nFootnote 12: Available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nAlthough often performed at small-scale laboratories, most viral inactivation and impurity clearance studies cannot be considered early process design experiments. Viral and impurity clearance studies intended to evaluate and estimate product quality at commercial scale should have a level of quality unit oversight that will ensure that the studies follow sound scientific methods and principles and the conclusions are supported by the data.\n\nProduct development activities provide key inputs to the process design stage, such as the intended dosage form, the quality attributes, and a general manufacturing pathway. Process information available from product development activities can be leveraged in the process design stage. The functionality and limitations of commercial manufacturing equipment should be considered in the process design, as well as predicted contributions to variability posed by different component lots, production operators, environmental conditions, and measurement systems in the production setting. However, the full spectrum of input variability typical of commercial production is not generally known at this stage. Laboratory or pilot-scale models designed to be representative of the commercial process can be used to estimate variability.\n\nDesigning an efficient process with an effective process control approach is dependent on the process knowledge and understanding obtained. Design of Experiment (DOE) studies can help develop process knowledge by revealing relationships, including multivariate interactions, between the variable inputs (e.g., component characteristics 13 or process parameters) and the resulting outputs (e.g., in-process material, intermediates, or the final product). Risk analysis tools can be used to screen potential variables for DOE studies to minimize the total number of experiments conducted while maximizing knowledge gained. The results of DOE studies can provide justification for establishing ranges of incoming component quality, equipmentparameters, and in-process material quality attributes. FDA does not generally expect manufacturers to develop and test the process until it fails.\n\nOther activities, such as experiments or demonstrations at laboratory or pilot scale, also assist in evaluation of certain conditions and prediction of performance of the commercial process. These activities also provide information that can be used to model or simulate the commercial process. Computer-based or virtual simulations of certain unit operations or dynamics can provide process understanding and help avoid problems at commercial scale. It is important to understand the degree to which models represent the commercial process, including any differences that might exist, as this may have an impact on the relevance of information derived from the models.\n\nIt is essential that activities and studies resulting in process understanding be documented. Documentation should reflect the basis for decisions made about the process. For example, manufacturers should document the variables studied for a unit operation and the rationale for those variables identified as significant. This information is useful during the process qualification and continued process verification stages, including when the design is revised or the strategy for control is refined or changed.\n\nii.2.2 Establishing a Strategy for Process Control\n\nProcess knowledge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach to process control for each unit operation and the process overall. Strategies for process control can be designed to reduce input variation, adjust for input variation during manufacturing (and so reduce its impact on the output), or combine both approaches.\n\nProcess controls address variability to assure quality of the product. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points (SS 211.110(c)). Decisions regarding the type and extent of process controls can be aided by earlier risk assessments, then enhanced and improved as process experience is gained.\n\nFDA expects controls to include both examination of material quality and equipment monitoring. Special attention to control the process through operational limits and in-process monitoring is essential in two possible scenarios:\n\nWhen the product attribute is not readily measurable due to limitations of sampling or detectability (e.g., viral clearance or microbial contamination) or\n\nWhen intermediates and products cannot be highly characterized and well-defined quality attributes cannot be identified.\n\nThese controls are established in the master production and control records (see SS 211.186(a) and (b)(9)).\n\nMore advanced strategies, which may involve the use of process analytical technology (PAT), can include timely analysis and control loops to adjust the processing conditions so that the output remains constant. Manufacturing systems of this type can provide a higher degree of process control than non-PAT systems. In the case of a strategy using PAT, the approach to process qualification will differ from that used in other process designs. Further information on PAT processes can be found in FDA's guidance for industry on PAT -- A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance.14\n--------------------\nContext title: Process Validation- General Principles and Practices Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.1512138843536377", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturing processes must consistently meet their parameters, and in-process materials must meet acceptance criteria or limits (SS 211.110(b) and (c)) so that, ultimately, finished pharmaceutical products will meet their acceptance criteria. Under a quality system, selected data are used to evaluate the quality of a process or product. In addition, data collection can provide a means to encourage and analyze potential suggestions for improvement. A quality systems approach calls for the manufacturer to develop procedures that monitor, measure, and analyze the operations (including analytical methods and/or statistical techniques). Monitoring of the process is important due to the limitations of testing. Knowledge continues to accumulate from development through the entire commercial life of a product. Significant unanticipated variables should be detected by a well-managed quality system and adjustments implemented. Procedures should be revisited as needed to refine operational design based on new knowledge. Process understanding increases with experience and helps identify when change will lead to continual improvement. When implementing data collection procedures, consider the following:\n\nAre data collection methods documented?\n\nWhen in the product life cycle will the data be collected?\n\nHow and to whom will measurement and monitoring activities be assigned?\n\nWhen should analysis and evaluation (e.g. trending) of laboratory data be performed? (see IV.D.1)What records should be collected?\n\nA modern quality system approach indicates that change control is warranted when data analysis or other information reveals an area for improvement. Changes to an established process must be controlled and documented to ensure that desired attributes for the finished product will be met (SS 211.100(a)).\n\nChange control with regard to pharmaceuticals is addressed in more detail in the CGMP regulations. When developing a process change, it is important to keep the process design and scientific knowledge of the product in mind. If major design issues are encountered through process experience, a firm may want to revisit the adequacy of the design of the manufacturing facility (SS 211.42), the design of the manufacturing equipment (SS 211.63), the design of the production and control procedures (SS 211.100), or the design of laboratory controls (SS 211.160). When implementing a change, its effect should be determined by monitoring and evaluating those specific elements that may be affected based on an understanding of the process. This approach allows the steps taken to implement a change and the effects of the change on the process to be considered systematically. Application of risk analysis may facilitate evaluating the potential effect of the change. Evaluating the effects of a change can entail additional tests or examinations of subsequent batches (e.g., additional in-process testing or additional stability studies). The quality system elements identified in this guidance, if implemented and maintained, will help a manufacturer manage change and implement continual improvement in manufacturing.\n\nUnder a quality systems approach, procedures should be in place to ensure the accuracy of test results. Test results that are out of specification may be due to testing problems or manufacturing problems and should be investigated. Any invalidation of a test result should be scientifically sound and justified.\n\nTo maintain quality, the Agency recommends that prior to completion of manufacturing, the manufacturer should consider storage and shipment requirements to meet special handling needs (in the case of pharmaceuticals, one example might be refrigeration).\n\nUnder a quality system, trends should be continually identified and evaluated. One way of accomplishing this is the use of statistical process control. The information from trend analyses can be used to continually monitor quality, identify potential variances before they become problems, bolster data already collected for the annual review, and facilitate improvement throughout the product life cycle. Process capability assessment can serve as a basis for determining the need for changes that can result in process improvements and efficiency (see IV.D.1.).\n\niv.3.4 Address Nonconformities\n\nA key component in any quality system is handling nonconformities and/or deviations. The investigation, conclusion, and follow-up must be documented (SS 211.192). To ensure that a product conforms to requirements and expectations, it is important to measure the process and the product attributes (e.g., specified control parameters, strength) as planned. Discrepancies may be detected during any stage of the process or during quality control activities. Not all discrepancies will result in product defects; however, it is important to document and handle discrepancies appropriately. A discrepancy investigation process is critical when a discrepancy is found that affects product quality (CGMP also requires this; see SS 211.192).\n\nIn a quality system, it is important to develop and document procedures that define who is responsible for halting and resuming operations, recording non-conformities, investigating discrepancies, and taking remedial action. Under a quality system, if a product or process does not meet requirements, it is essential to identify and/or segregate the product so that it is not distributed to the customer. Remedial action can include any of the following:\n\nCorrect the non-conformity\n\nWith proper authorization, allow the product to proceed with justification of the conclusions regarding the problem's impact\n\nUse the product for another application where the deficiency does not affect the products' quality\n\nReject the product\n\nThe corrected product or process should also be re-examined for conformance and assessed for the significance of the non-conformity (see, e.g., SS 211.115). If the non-conformity is significant, based on consequences to process control, process efficiency, product quality, safety, efficacy, and product availability, it is important to evaluate how to prevent recurrence (see IV.D.4.). If an individual product that does not meet requirements has been released, the product can be recalled.18 Customer complaints must be reviewed and then investigated if a discrepancy is identified (SS 211.198).\n\nFootnote 18: See 21 CFR Part 7.\n\nThe following table shows how the CGMP regulations correlate to specific elements in the quality systems model. Manufacturers should always refer to the specific regulations to ensure that they are comp\n\nAppendix D Evaluation Activities\n\nAs in the previous section, the elements of a quality system correlate closely with the requirements in the CGMP regulations. See the table at the end of the section for the specifics.\n\nd.0.1 Analyze Data for Trends\n\nQuality systems call for continually monitoring trends and improving systems. This can be achieved by monitoring data and information, identifying and resolving problems, and anticipating and preventing problems.\n\nQuality systems procedures involve collecting data from monitoring, measurement, complaint handling, or other activities, and tracking this data over time, as appropriate. Analysis of data can provide indications that controls are losing effectiveness. The information generated will be essential to achieving problem resolution or problem prevention (see IV.D.3.).\n\nAlthough the CGMP regulations (SS 211.180(e)) require product review on at least an annual basis, a quality systems approach calls for trending on a more frequent basis as determined by risk. Trending enables the detection of potential problems as early as possible to plan corrective and preventive actions. Another important concept of modern quality systems is the use of trending to examine processes as a whole; this is consistent with the annual review approach. Trending analyses can help focus internal audits (see IV.D.2.).\n\nd.0.2 Conduct Internal Audits\n\nA quality systems approach calls for audits to be conducted at planned intervals to evaluate effective implementation and maintenance of the quality system and to determine if processes and products meet established parameters and specifications. As with other procedures, auditprocedures should be developed and documented to ensure that the planned audit schedule takes into account the relative risks of the various quality system activities, the results of previous audits and corrective actions, and the need to audit the complete system. Procedures should describe how auditors are trained in objective evidence gathering, their responsibilities, and auditing procedures. Procedures should also define auditing activities such as the scope and methodology of the audit, selection of auditors, and audit conduct (audit plans, opening meetings, interviews, closing meeting and reports). It is critical to maintain records of audit findings and assign responsibility for follow-up to prevent problems from recurring (see IV.D.3.).\n\nThe quality systems model calls for managers who are responsible for the areas audited to take timely action to resolve audit findings and ensure that follow-up actions are completed, verified, and recorded. (FDA's policy is to refrain from both reviewing and copying reports or records that result from internal audits per Compliance Policy Guide 130.300.19)\n\nFootnote 19: See Reference #8.\n\niv.3.3 Quality Risk Management\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.1766340732574463", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.44221568107605", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Commercial Manufacturing (3.1.3)\n\nThe goals of manufacturing activities include achieving product realization, establishing and maintaining a state of control, and facilitating continual improvement. The pharmaceutical quality system should assure that the desired product quality is routinely met, suitable process performance is achieved, the set of controls are appropriate, improvement opportunities are identified and evaluated, and the body of knowledge is continually expanded.\n\nProduct Discontinuation (3.1.4)\n\nThe goal of product discontinuation activities is to manage the terminal stage of the product lifecycle effectively. For product discontinuation, a predefined approach should be used to manage activities such as retention of documentation and samples and continued product assessment (e.g., complaint handling and stability) and reporting in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System Elements (3.2)\n\nThe elements described below might be required in part under regional GMP regulations.\n\nHowever, the Q10 model's intent is to enhance these elements to promote the lifecycle approach to product quality. These four elements are:\n\nProcess performance and product quality monitoring system\n\nCorrective action and preventive action (CAPA) system\n\nChange management system\n\nManagement review of process performance and product quality\n\nThese elements should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognizing the differences among the stages and the different goals of each stage. Throughout the product lifecycle, companies are encouraged to evaluate opportunities for innovative approaches to improve product quality.\n\nEach element is followed by a table of example applications of the element to the stages of the pharmaceutical lifecycle.\n\nProcess Performance and Product Quality Monitoring System 3.2.1\n\nPharmaceutical companies should plan and execute a system for the monitoring of process performance and product quality to ensure a state of control is maintained. An effective monitoring system provides assurance of the continued capability of processes and controls to produce a product of desired quality and to identify areas for continual improvement. The process performance and product quality monitoring system should:1. Use quality risk management to establish the control strategy. This can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control. The control strategy should facilitate timely feedback/feedforward and appropriate corrective action and preventive action. 2. Provide the tools for measurement and analysis of parameters and attributes identified in the control strategy (e.g., data management and statistical tools). 3. Analyze parameters and attributes identified in the control strategy to verify continued operation within a state of control. 4. Identify sources of variation affecting process performance and product quality for potential continual improvement activities to reduce or control variation. 5. Include feedback on product quality from both internal and external sources (e.g., complaints, product rejections, nonconformances, recalls, deviations, audits and regulatory inspections, and findings). 6. Provide knowledge to enhance process understanding, enrich the design space (where established), and enable innovative approaches to process validation.\n\n3.2.2 Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) System (3.2.2)\n\nThe pharmaceutical company should have a system for implementing corrective actions and preventive actions resulting from the investigation of complaints, product rejections, nonconformances, recalls, deviations, audits, regulatory inspections and findings, and trends from process performance and product quality monitoring. A structured approach to the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{85.4pt}|p{85.4pt}|p{85.4pt}|p{85.4pt}|} \\hline\nPharmaceutical Development & Technology Transfer & Commercial Manufacturing & Product Discontinuation \\ \\hline Process and product knowledge generated and process and product monitoring & Monitoring during scale-up activities can provide a preliminary indication of process & A well-defined system for process & Once manufacturing ceases, monitoring such as stability testing should continue to completion of the studies.

The level of effort, formality, and documentation of the investigation should be commensurate with the level of risk, in line with ICH Q9. CAPA methodology should result in product and process improvements and enhanced product and process understanding.\n\n3.3.3 Change Management System (3.2.3)\n\nInnovation, continual improvement, the outputs of process performance and product quality monitoring, and CAPA drive change. To evaluate, approve, and implement these changes properly, a company should have an effective change management system. There is generally a difference in formality of change management processes prior to the initial regulatory submission and after submission, where changes to the regulatory filing might be required under regional requirements.\n\nThe change management system ensures continual improvement is undertaken in a timely and effective manner. It should provide a high degree of assurance there are no unintended consequences of the change.\n\nThe change management system should include the following, as appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle:\n\nQuality risk management should be utilized to evaluate proposed changes. The level of effort and formality of the evaluation should be commensurate with the level of risk.\n\nProposed changes should be evaluated relative to the marketing authorization, including design space, where established, and/or current product and process understanding. There should be an assessment to determine whether a change to the regulatory filing is required under regional requirements. As stated in ICH Q8, working within the design space is not considered a change (from a regulatory filing perspective). However, from a pharmaceutical quality system standpoint, all changes should be evaluated by a company's change management system.\n\nProposed changes should be evaluated by expert teams contributing the appropriate\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}} \\hline\nPharmaceutical Development & Technology Transfer & Commercial Manufacturing & Product Discontinuation \\ \\hline Product or process variability is explored.

After implementation, an evaluation of the change should be undertaken to confirm the change objectives were achieved and that there was no deleterious impact on product quality.\n\n3.2.4 Management Review of Process Performance and Product Quality (3.2.4)\n\nManagement review should provide assurance that process performance and product quality are managed over the lifecycle. Depending on the size and complexity of the company, management review can be a series of reviews at various levels of management and should include a timely and effective communication and escalation process to raise appropriate quality issues to senior levels of management for review.\n\nThe management review system should include: 1. The results of regulatory inspections and findings, audits and other assessments, and commitments made to regulatory authorities 2. Periodic quality reviews, that can include: 1. Measures of customer satisfaction such as product quality complaints and recalls 2. Conclusions of process performance and product quality monitoring 3. The effectiveness of process and product changes including those arising from corrective action and preventive actions 3. Any follow-up actions from previous management reviews 2. The management review system should identify appropriate actions, such as: 1. Improvements to manufacturing processes and products 2.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction and Scope\n\nFDA seeks to encourage medical device research and innovation to address important clinical needs and improve patient care. In many cases, device development and evaluation include clinical investigation. This guidance document has been developed to facilitate the initiation of clinical investigations to evaluate medical devices under FDA's Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulations, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 812.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE submission allows the initiation of subject enrollment in a clinical investigation of a significant risk1 device. This guidance is intended to provide clarification regarding the regulatory implications of the decisions that FDA may render based on review of an IDE as well as a general explanation of the reasons for those decisions.\n\nFootnote 1: 21 CFR 812.3(m): A significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\n(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\n(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nand communication of outstanding issues related to the IDE through Study Design Considerations and Future Considerations, are described in this guidance.2\n\nFDA's decision-making for IDEs was modified with passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE because:\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not offer specific information related to the design of a clinical investigation, nor does this guidance discuss the specific content that should be provided in an IDE application. For additional information on those topics, please refer to FDA\u2019s regulations (21 CFR Part 812) and to FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance on IDE Policies and Procedures\u201d\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm080202.htm).\n\n(i): the investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device; (ii): the investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or (iii): an additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nHowever, the Agency recognizes that some IDE sponsors may wish to ensure that the pivotal study design may support a marketing application if it is successfully executed, meets its stated endpoints, and does not raise unforeseen safety concerns. Through mechanisms such as the Pre-Submission3 process, FDA wishes to work interactively with sponsors interested in addressing important limitations with such a study that might impair its ability to support a future marketing application.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 3: For more information, see FDA\u2019s Guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf\n\n2 IDE Decisions\n\nFDA's regulations4 provide for three FDA actions on IDE applications:\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.30.\n\nApproval5* Approval with Conditions6\n\nDisapproval\n\nFDA must inform the sponsor7 or sponsor-investigator8 of its decision, or must notify the sponsor that the investigation may not begin, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the IDE application, or the IDE application will be deemed approved. If an IDE application is approved or approved with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment, up to the number of subjects and investigational sites specified in FDA's decision letter, upon receipt of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which may occur prior to FDA approval.\n\nFootnote 6: As discussed in Section 5, enrollment for an IDE application that is Approved or Approved with Conditions may in some cases be limited to a portion of the total expected enrollment (i.e., \u201cStaged Approval\u201d) while certain outstanding questions are answered concurrently with enrollment in the clinical investigation.\n\nFootnote 7: FDA has traditionally referred to IDE approvals that have conditions as \u201cConditional Approvals.\u201d FDA believes that the term \u201cApproval with Conditions\u201d is more appropriate because the term conveys that the IDE has been approved and may begin without awaiting further FDA review.\n\nFootnote 8: 21 CFR 812.3(n): Sponsor means a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, that is, the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.\n\nFootnote 9: The term \u201capproval\u201d in this document and in FDA\u2019s communications means approval without conditions.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.295251369476318", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: If a clinical study is needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to obtaining 510(k) clearance of the device, the study should generally be conducted under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, 21 CFR 812. Generally, we believe PTA balloon catheters and specialty catheters addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of 21 CFR part 812. Please see the FDA guidance, \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.\"13 In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR part 812, sponsors of such trials must comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR part 50). When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States are submitted to FDA for PTA and specialty catheters, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply.14 21 CFR 812.28 outlines the conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations conducted outside the US when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more information, see the FDA guidance, \"Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.\"15\n\nFootnote 13: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/significant-risk-and-nonsignificant-risk-medical-device-studies\n\nFootnote 14: Applies to data from clinical investigations that began on or after February 21, 2019 and are submitted to support a premarket submission, including IDEs, PMAs, and 510(k)s.\n\nFootnote 15: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/acceptance-clinical-data-support-medical-device-applications-and-submissions-frequently-asked\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nIn some cases, \"real-world data\" (RWD) may be used to support expansion of the indication for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be required. For additional information regarding this topic, please refer to the FDA Guidance entitled \"Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices.\"16\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nAppendix J Labeling\n\nThe regulatory submission must include proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e) for premarket notifications. Labeling for PTA balloon catheters and specialty balloons should include all applicable information, including indications, contraindications, warnings, product information, a summary of the clinical data (if applicable), and directions for use.\n\nAs prescription devices, PTA balloon and specialty catheters are exempt from having adequate directions for lay use under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as long as the conditions in 21 CFR 801.109 are met. For instance, labeling must include adequate information for practitioner use of the device, including indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration (e.g., infusion time, inflation duration), and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR 801.109(d)).\n\nAppendix K Modifications\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device change or modification \"that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device\" or represents \"a major change or modification in the intended use of the device\" requires a new 510(k).17 The changes or modifications listed below are examples of changes that may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that are likely to require submission of a new 510(k). For additional details, please see FDA guidance \"Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.\"18\n\nFootnote 17: Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, Title III of Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (\u201cFDORA\u201d), enacted on December 29, 2022, added section 515C \u201cPredetermined Change Control Plans for Devices\u201d to the FD&C Act (section 515C). Under section 515C, FDA can approve or clear a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) for a device that describes planned changes that may be made to the device and that would otherwise require a supplemental premarket approval application or premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that a supplemental premarket approval application (section 515C(a)) or a premarket notification (section 515C(b)) is not required for a change to a device if the change is consistent with a PCCP that is approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides that FDA may require that a PCCP include labeling for safe and effective use of a device as such device changes pursuant to such plan, notification requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan, and performance requirements for changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your marketing submission, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH. See FDA\u2019s guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nFootnote 18: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-change-existing-device\n\nContents\n\n1\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExamples of changes or modifications in the indications for use of the device that would likely require a new 510(k) are:\n\nA change in specific lesion characteristics (e.g., chronic total occlusion, ISR).\n\nClaims in improvement of outcomes in other technologies (e.g., pre-treatment with scoring balloons improves outcomes of drug-coated balloons).\n\nWe believe that the following modifications will likely not require submission of a new 510(k):\n\nMinor changes in packaging: A minor change in packaging (e.g., replacing hardcopy instructions for use with an electronic version, update to the expiration date) is not expected to impact device safety and performance.\n\nIncrease in shelf-life: An increase in device shelf-life is not expected to impact device safety and performance as long as the testing protocol has been previously reviewed and accepted in a prior submission. Additionally, the test results should fall within the acceptance criteria previously found to be acceptable.\n--------------------\nContext title: Peripheral Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) and Specialty Catheters - Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.4014732837677", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: 21 CFR part 812.\n\nFootnote 17: See the guidance for sponsors, clinical investigators, IRBs, and FDA staff FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations (August 2014) and the guidance for IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors IRB Responsibilities for Reviewing the Qualifications of Investigators, Adequacy of Research Sites, and the Determination of Whether an IND/IDE is Needed (August 2013).\n\nSponsors interested in pursuing the development of a specific biomarker test for marketing as a device should consult the appropriate center at FDA (CDRH or CBER) responsible for review of the IVD.\n\nFootnote 18: See the draft guidance for industry, FDA staff, sponsors, and IRBs Investigational IVDs Used in Clinical Investigations of Therapeutic Products (December 2017).

The analysis plan should describe the futility analyses to be conducted. FDA recommends designs, such as the Simon two-stage design, that limit exposure to an ineffective drug (Simon 1989). However, other statistical approaches may be acceptable and, if proposed, should be described in detail in the SAP. If a sponsor anticipates that the results would form the basis of an efficacy claim in a marketing application, the clinical protocol and SAP should ensure that collected data are of adequate quality for this purpose. If preliminary results from a substudy or substudies suggest a major advance over available therapy, the sponsor should meet with the review division to discuss modifications to the protocol (e.g., to propose interim analyses for efficacy or consider early termination of the trial) or to modify the development program (e.g., discuss potential for breakthrough therapy designation).\n\nRandomized Designs\n\nIf a sponsor incorporates randomization into an umbrella trial design, FDA recommends use of a common control arm when possible. The general comments about generation of an appropriate SAP and information about futility analysis in the previous section (VII. A., Nonrandomized, Activity-Estimating Design) also apply to randomized trials. Before initiating the proposed substudy, the sponsor should meet with the division to discuss the SAP with regard to how the strength of evidence will be assessed and how potential sources of bias will be controlled.\n\nMaster Protocols Employing Adaptive/Bayesian Design\n\nIn master protocols that incorporate adaptive designs, the SAP should provide all information described in the guidances for industry Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics and Enrichment Strategies for Clinical Trials to Support Determination of Effectiveness of Human Drugs and Biological Products. The SAP should also describe plans for futility analyses.22 Master protocols can use a Bayesian statistical method or other methods for planning or modifying the sample size, dropping an arm, and other adaptive strategies. The SAP should include details on implementation of Bayesian or other methods.\n\nFootnote 22: See also the ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and the guidance for clinical trial sponsors Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees.\n\nMaster Protocols With Biomarker-Defined Subgroups\n\nIn master protocols with basket or complex design, where human subject assignment to a treatment arm is based on the presence of a specific biomarker of interest, the protocol should clearly specify how subjects with more than one biomarker of interest will be assigned tosubstudies. There are two approaches to making such assignments that FDA recommends from a clinical trial design perspective, but other approaches may also be appropriate. One approach is to prioritize biomarkers or treatments. For example, in the BATTLE-1 trial, investigators ranked the biomarker groups based on their predictive values and assigned human subjects with multiple biomarkers to the group for one of their biomarkers that has the highest predictive value (Kim et al. 2011). The other approach is based on a prespecified randomization ratio. For example, the Lung-MAP trial uses a reversed ratio of prevalence rates. Using reverse prevalence ratios, subjects in the trial with tumors that have biomarkers with low prevalence have a greater likelihood to be assigned to a substudy for the lower prevalence population.23 Consideration should be given to the clinical relevance, if any, of low-prevalence passenger mutations that coexist with driver mutations, for which adjustment to randomization may not be needed. Sponsors should provide justification for the selected approach and should state in the justification whether the proposed approach of assigning subjects with more than one biomarker of interest to a particular substudy would impact the prevalence of the biomarkers in each subpopulation and whether any statistical methods to address this potential issue/bias are needed.\n\nFootnote 23: See the guidance for industry Developing Targeted Therapies in Low-Frequency Molecular Subsets of a Disease (October 2018).\n\nVIII Safety Considerations\n\nSafety Monitoring and Reporting Plans\n\nThe sponsor of the master protocol IND is required to ensure proper monitoring of the investigations and to ensure that the investigations are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND (21 CFR 312.50).24 Similarly, the sponsor of the investigational product IND for a drug that will be administered under a master protocol IND is responsible for monitoring the safety of its drug and evaluating all accumulating safety data, including data from trials not conducted by the sponsor of the investigational product IND (21 CFR 312.32(b)). The sponsor of the master protocol IND should establish a systematic approach that ensures rapid communication of serious safety issues to all participating clinical investigators and FDA under IND safety reporting regulations.25 Additionally the master protocol IND sponsor should ensure rapid communication of serious safety issues to the sponsors of all products used in the master protocol, according to the established safety reporting plan. In addition, the approach should describe the process for rapid implementation of protocol amendments to address serious safety issues.26\n\nFootnote 24: See the guidance for industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations \u2014 A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring (August 2013).\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nSafety monitoring and reporting obligations of the sponsor of the master protocol IND and sponsors of each IND covered by the master protocol remain unchan\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThese reporting obligations are described, along with recommendations to help sponsors comply with expedited safety reporting requirements, in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities--Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies (June 2021).27\n\nFootnote 27: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nFor master protocols in oncology, FDA may expect a sponsor to conduct aggregate analyses of all SAEs at intervals based on the volume of safety data collected or based on the number of subjects accrued into the master protocol in order to fulfill its review obligations under 312.32(b). A sponsor would then be required to submit events that qualify for reporting under 312.32(c) and as described in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities--Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies. The frequency of the cumulative aggregate safety analyses should be discussed with the Agency at a pre-IND meeting, taking into account specific program needs.\n\nGiven the complexity of and the generally rapid accrual to these trials, resulting in increased risks to subjects should there be a failure to promptly identify suspected and unexpected serious adverse reactions, sponsors should select medical monitors who have training and experience in cancer research and in the conduct of clinical trials so that safety information can be promptly assessed.\n\nIndependent Safety Assessment\n--------------------\nContext title: Master Protocols- Efficient Clinical Trial Design Strategies to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.28214430809021", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFactors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nGuidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor- Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on January 13, 2017.\n\nThis guidance will have a 60 day implementation period.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on June 18, 2015.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Device Evaluation, Office of the Director, Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) Staff at 301-796-5640.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is committed to improving U.S. patient access to new devices by strengthening and streamlining the clinical trial enterprise so that medical device clinical trials are conducted in the U.S. in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining appropriate patient and research participant protections.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide greater clarity for FDA staff and investigational device exemption (IDE) sponsors and sponsor-investigators1 regarding the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing the benefits and risks of IDE applications for human clinical studies.\n\nConsistent with applicable laws and regulations, FDA may disapprove an IDE application if, among other reasons, \"[t]here is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained.\"2 In many cases, the Agency believes that effective risk management, including the application of risk controls, which includes risk mitigation measures, can result in a favorable IDE benefit-risk determination.\n\nFDA recognizes that in assessing risks and anticipated benefits, the medical device total product lifecycle should be considered, and that earlier stages of device development and investigational clinical study are typically associated with greater uncertainty (i.e., a lower level of evidence). A primary goal of this guidance is to clarify the factors that FDA considers when assessing risks and anticipated benefits as significant contributors to the decision to approve IDE studies, and how uncertainty may be offset by a variety of risk mitigation measures which can ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings. For proposed IDE studies, at earlier stages of device development, FDA considers appropriate mitigation measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages, FDA considers whether risk mitigation measures focus on the most probable risks.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\nAnother important goal of this guidance is to characterize benefits in the context of investigational research, which includes direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for evaluating marketing applications, FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting in which the study is being proposed, including but not limited to characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed, the availability of and risks associated with alternative treatments or diagnostics. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and their perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment. See for more information FDA Guidance, Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA believes use of this benefit-risk framework will facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. FDA envisions this will facilitate a common understanding between FDA and sponsors/sponsor-investigators by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors influence FDA's decisions. This guidance document will also help improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for IDE applications.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing benefits and risks of original IDE applications, IDE amendments and IDE supplements for human clinical investigations of certain medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness. The approach discussed in this guidance is applicable to studies subject to the IDE requirements in 21 CFR part 812, including postmarket studies. In general, IDE applications are required for clinical investigations of significant risk devices to determine safety and effectiveness.3 This guidance applies to both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This guidance is not intended to provide recommendations regarding device-specific data or study requirements.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.8385398387908936", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on August 31, 2017.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on July 27, 2016\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB) at 301-796-5997 or CDRHCilicalEvidence@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CBER-regulated devices, contact the Office of Communication, Outreach, and Development (OCOD) at 1-800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nUA U.S. FOOD & DRUG\n\nACMINISTration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction and Scope\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to clarify how we evaluate real-world data to determine whether they are sufficient for generating the types of real-world evidence that can be used in FDA regulatory decision-making for medical devices. This guidance is applicable to all devices, as that term is defined under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), including software that meets the definition of a device.\n\nReal-World Data (RWD) are data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources.\n\nExamples of RWD include data derived from electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing data, data from product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile devices. RWD sources (e.g., registries, collections of EHRs, and administrative and healthcare claims databases) can be used as data collection and analysis infrastructure to support many types of trial designs, including, but not limited to, randomized trials, such as large simple trials, pragmatic clinical trials, and observational studies (prospective and/or retrospective ).\n\nReal-World Evidence (RWE) is the clinical evidence regarding the usage, and potential benefits or risks, of a medical product derived from analysis of RWD.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUnder the right conditions, data derived from real world sources can be used to support regulatory decisions. RWD and associated RWE may constitute valid scientific evidence depending on the characteristics of the data. This guidance should not be construed to alter, or change in any way, the existing evidentiary standards applicable to FDA's regulatory decision-making; rather, it describes the circumstances under which RWD may be used to support a variety of FDA decisions based on the existing evidentiary standards. While FDA encourages the use of relevant and reliable RWD, this guidance neither mandates its use nor restricts other means of providing evidence to support regulatory decision-making. This guidance highlights some of the potential uses of RWD, and describes the factors that FDA considers when evaluating whether specific RWD is of sufficient quality to inform or support a regulatory decision. It also clarifies when an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) may be needed to prospectively collect and use RWD for purposes of determining the safety and effectiveness of a device.\n\nThis document does not address the use of non-clinical data, adverse event reports, secondary use of clinical trial data (e.g., post hoc analyses), or systematic literature reviews. Nor does it address study design/conduct or analytical methodologies. While it does describe the factors that FDA considers when evaluating RWD or RWE, it does not provide a specific set of pass/fail criteria or other scoring tools for making a determination about the suitability of RWD or RWE for a particular regulatory decision.\n\nThis guidance does not affect any federal, state or local laws or regulations, or foreign laws or regulations that may be applicable to the use or collection of RWD, or that provide protections for human subjects (including informed consent requirements) or patient privacy. This guidance should be used to complement, but not supersede, other device-specific and good clinical practice guidance documents.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nTo protect and promote the public health, FDA needs to understand and evaluate the available evidence related to regulated products.1 For medical devices, available evidence is traditionally comprised of non-clinical and, in some cases, clinical studies conducted and provided to FDA by the device manufacturer or sponsor. However, FDA recognizes that a wealth of RWD covering medical device experience exists and is routinely collected in the course of treatment and management of patients. Data collected during clinical care or in the home setting may not have the same quality controls as data collected within a clinical trial setting. Even so, under certain circumstances RWD may be of sufficient quality to help inform or augment FDA's understanding of the benefit-risk profile of devices at various points in their life cycle. RWD, which are typically collected for non-regulatory purposes in EHRs, registries, and administrative and claims data, may provide new insights into the performance and clinical outcomes associated with medical device use. This information can potentially be used by sponsors to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements and to aid FDA in our regulatory decision-making.\n\nFDA has issued guidance documents on premarket and postmarket data collection,2 benefit-risk determinations,3 patient preference information,4 and expedited access to medical devices for unmet medical needs in order to streamline the process for bringing new technologies to market while maintaining the assessment of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of medical devices. FDA has also issued plans for, and has begun implementation of, the National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST)5,6,7,8 to leverage RWD in order to more quickly identify safety problems and to better understand the benefit-risk profile of devices used in clinical care. FDA believes that, if leveraged correctly, the NEST may also help to reduce the time and cost of generating the types of evidence used to support the marketing authorization of FDA-regulated products and to meet postmarket study and reporting requirements.\n\nFootnote 2: Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm393994.pdf).\n\nFootnote 3: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf)\n\nFootnote 4: Patient Preference Information \u2013 Voluntary Submission, Review in Premarket Approval Applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption Applications, and De Novo Requests, and Inclusion in Decision Summaries and Device Labeling (Patient Preference Information \u2013 Voluntary Submission, Review in Premarket Approval Applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption Applications, and De Novo Requests, and Inclusion in Decision Summaries and Devices Labeling\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l} \\hline \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Key:} \\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nDevices are often used in routine clinical practice for uses that are not within their cleared or approved indications for use. However, the knowledge gained from all uses of a device in medical practice is often not realized because the data collected are not systematically characterized, aggregated, and analyzed in a way that can be relied upon to inform regulatory decision-making. By recognizing the value of RWE as an important contributing factor for understanding and regulating medical devices, we hope to encourage the medical community to learn more from routine clinical care than we do today.\n--------------------\nContext title: Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6334632635116577", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations\n\nfor Medical Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry,\n\nClinical Investigators,\n\nInstitutional Review Boards and Food and Drug\n\nAdministration Staff\n\nDocument issued on: November 7, 2021\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on August 15, 2011.\n\nFor questions regarding this document that relate to devices regulated by CDRH, contact Gregory Campbell, PhD at (301) 796-5750 or by email at greg.campbell@fda.hhs.gov, if desired.\n\nFor questions regarding this document that relate to devices regulated by CBER, contact Stephen Ripley at 301-827-6210.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCenter for Biologic Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nWritten comments and suggestions may be submitted at any time for Agency consideration to the Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, (HFA-305), Rockville, MD, 20852.\n\nAdditional Copies\n\nAdditional copies are available from the Internet.

Although the Agency has articulated policies related to design of studies intended to support specific device types, and a general policy of tailoring the evidentiary burden to the regulatory requirement, the Agency has not attempted to describe the different clinical study designs that may be appropriate to support a device pre-market submission, or to define how a sponsor should decide which pivotal clinical study design should be used to support a submission for a particular device. This guidance document describes different study design principles relevant to the development of medical device clinical studies that can be used to fulfill pre-market clinical data requirements. This guidance is not intended to provide a comprehensive tutorial on the best clinical and statistical practices for investigational medical device studies.\n\nMedical devices can undergo three general stages of clinical development. These stages may be extremely dependent on each other and doing a thorough evaluation in one stage can make the next stage much more straightforward. To begin, medical devices may undergo an exploratory clinical stage. In this stage, the limitations and advantages of the medical device are evaluated. This stage includes first-in-human studies and feasibility studies. The next stage, the pivotal stage, is used to develop the information necessary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device for the identified intended use. It usually consists of one or more pivotal studies. Finally, devices undergo a post-market stage which can include an additional study or studies for better understanding of device safety, such as rare adverse events and long-term effectiveness. This guidance provides information on design issues related to pivotal clinical investigations and does not address the other stages in any detail.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA medical device pivotal study is a definitive study in which evidence is gathered to support the safety and effectiveness evaluation of the medical device for its intended use. Evidence from one or more pivotal clinical studies generally serves as the primary basis for the determination of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the medical device of a pre-market approval application (PMA) and FDA's overall benefit-risk determination. In some cases, a PMA may include multiple studies designed to answer different scientific questions.\n\nThe focus of this guidance is providing recommendations to sponsors on how to design clinical investigations to support a PMA. However, sponsors who conduct clinical studies to support pre-market notification (510(k)) and de novo submissions may also rely on the principles in this guidance document.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance describes principles for the design of pre-market clinical studies1 that are pivotal in establishing the safety and effectiveness of a medical device. Practical issues and pitfalls in pivotal clinical study design are discussed, along with their effects on the conclusions that can be drawn from the studies concerning safety and effectiveness. The principles discussed in this guidance are intended to assist sponsors of marketing applications and investigators in designing studies adequate to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness concerning a device.\n\nFootnote 1: For purposes of this guidance the term \u201cstudies\u201d is equivalent to the term \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nTypes of Studies Addressed in this Guidance\n\nDue to the range of intended uses and risks associated with medical devices and constraints in executing clinical studies, this guidance treats pivotal clinical studies in a general manner. It frames FDA's recommendations in terms of two broad categories of medical devices:\n\nTherapeutic and aesthetic devices\n\nDiagnostic devices\n\nFrom this guidance, device developers can gain insight about important pivotal study design issues for devices in each of these categories. At the same time, communication with FDA review staff (e.g., through a pre-submission interaction) is often valuable in arriving at pivotal clinical study designs that are both practical and adequate.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis guidance also includes principles that are applicable to the device-specific issues for combination products defined under 21 CFR Part 3 (e.g., device-drug products; device-biologic products). However, drug-specific or biologic-specific issues that may also be relevant for a combination product are not described in this guidance.\n\nThis guidance is intended to complement other existing guidance, and is not intended to replace the policies described in other guidance documents. In cases where questions arise, consult the appropriate FDA review division directly or the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance and Consumer Assistance or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Communication, Outreach and Development (OCOD) depending on which Center is responsible for review of the device.\n\nTypes of Studies Not Addressed in this Guidance\n\nAlthough this guidance does not address the following kinds of studies, some principles discussed herein are applicable to many of them:\n\nNon-clinical studies (e.g., bench, animal or measurement studies and, for in vitro diagnostic devices, analytical validation studies);\n\nHumanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Regulation: Questions and Answers, at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucml110194.htm, for detailed information.\n\nPre-market feasibility clinical studies, or other pre-market clinical studies that are not part of the pivotal stage;\n\nStudies to establish the clinical validity of companion diagnostic devices (i.e., in vitro diagnostic tests that provide essential information for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product). Clinical development programs for companion diagnostic devices are typically part of the clinical development programs of the corresponding therapeutic products;\n\nPost-market clinical studies. Though the need for post-market clinical studies might arise from interpretation of pre-market clinical results, post-market studies do not drive the initial determination of safety and effectiveness, and their design is not addressed in this guidance. However, the principles discussed in this guidance may be useful in designing such studies;\n\nStudies of products regulated by CBER that require an Investigational New Drug application and Biologics License Application, such as donor screening tests, are not included in the scope of the guidance.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.665444016456604"], "Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

In the exercise of its enforcement discretion, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action if manufacturers continue to submit such changes in their annual reports. The use of enforcement discretion will give the Agency time to clarify that some of these types of postapproval changes can be submitted in an annual report, rather than in a CBE-30. The Agency intends to clarify this issue in an upcoming revision to the guidance for industry\n\nChanges to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nBackground\n\nOn April 8, 2004, FDA published in the Federal Register (69 FR 18728) the final rule entitled Supplements and Other Changes to an Approved Application. In the same issue of the Federal Register (69 FR 18768), FDA announced the availability of the guidance for industry entitled Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (the Changes guidance). The final rule sets forth requirements for postapproval changes.\n\nUnder section 314.70(c)(2)(iii) of the final rule, the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test to comply with an official compendium that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements must be submitted as a supplement - changes-being-effected-in-30 days (CBE-30) (see section VIII.C.1.e of the Changes guidance). Under 314.70(d)(2)(i) of the final rule, any change in a specification made to comply with an official compendium, except the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements, is to be submitted as an Annual Report (see section VIII.D.1 of the Changes guidance).\n\nSince publication of the final rule, the Agency has received communications from NDA and ANDA holders requesting clarification of the regulation as it applies to changes such as excipient monographs and general chapters. As written now, the regulations could be interpreted to require a CBE for any compendial change to relax or delete a test, resulting in an increase in the number of supplements, something that was not intended. The Agency plans to revise the Guidance for Industry: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers to provide more specific recommendations as to what types of changes can be submitted in an annual report instead of a CBE-30 supplement.\n\nIn addition, the Agency is aware that stakeholders have expressed concern that the final rule (i.e., 21 CFR 314.70), which published on April 8, 2004, and the accompanying Changes guidance do not take into consideration the recent FDA Pharmaceutical CGMP Initiative for the 21({}^{\\rm st}) Century. Accordingly, the Agency plans to align this guidance with the initiative in order to facilitate manufacturing changes to enhance product quality.\n\nIII Exercise of enforcement discretion\n\nFDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion and does not intend to take action to enforce compliance with the compendial changes requirement as stated in 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii) if manufacturers submit such changes in their annual reports. FDA intends to develop further guidance to clarify the requirere nts of 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Specifications \u2013 Use of Enforcement Discretion for Compendial Changes Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.4535410404205322", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

The guidance covers recommended reporting categories for postapproval changes for drugs other than specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products. It supersedes the guidance of the same title published November 1999. Recommendations are provided for postapproval changes in (1) components and composition, (2) manufacturing sites, (3) manufacturing process, (4) specifications, (5) container closure system, and (6) labeling, as well as (7) miscellaneous changes and (8) multiple related changes.\n\nRecommendations on reporting categories for changes relating to specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products regulated by CDER are found in the guidance for industryentitled Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products (July 1997).2\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is currently revising the 1997 guidance and intends to issue it in draft for public comment.\n\nOn November 21, 1997, the President signed the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act).3 Section 116 of the Modernization Act amended the the Act by adding section 506A, which provides requirements for making and reporting manufacturing changes to an approved application and for distributing a drug product made with such changes. The FDA has revised its regulations on supplements and other changes to an approved application (21 CFR 314.70) to conform to section 506A of the Act.\n\nFootnote 3: Public Law 105-115.\n\nThis guidance does not provide recommendations on the specific information that should be developed by an applicant to assess the effect of the change on the identity, strength (e.g., assay, content uniformity), quality (e.g., physical, chemical, and biological properties), purity (e.g., impurities and degradation products), or potency (e.g., biological activity, bioavailability, bioequivalence) of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. An applicant should consider all relevant CDER guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change.4\n\nFootnote 4: A list of CDER guidances is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nCDER has published guidances, including the SUPAC (scale-up and postapproval changes) guidances, that provide recommendations on reporting categories. To the extent that the recommendations on reporting categories in this guidance are found to be inconsistent with guidances published before this guidance was finalized, the recommended reporting categories in such previously published guidances are superseded by this guidance. This guidance does not provide extensive recommendations on reporting categories for components and composition changes (see section V). Therefore, recommended reporting categories for components and composition changes provided in previously published guidances, such as the SUPAC guidances, still apply. Section 506A of the Act and SS 314.70(c) provide for two types of changes-being-effected supplements (see section II), while previously there was only one type. It is important for applicants to use this guidance to determine which type of changes-being-effected supplement is recommended. CDER intends to update the previously published guidances to make them consistent with this guidance.\n\nIf guidance for either recommended reporting categories or information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, the appropriate CDER chemistry or microbiology review staff can be consulted for advice.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, in general, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. Insofar as this guidance adjusts reporting categories pursuant to section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR 314.70, it does have binding effect. If you have any questions about the effect of any portion of this guidance, contact the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-003), Food and Drug Association, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\nII Reporting Categories\n\nSection 506A of the Act and $ 314.70 provide for four reporting categories that are distinguished in the following paragraphs.\n\nA major change is a change that has a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. A major change requires the submission of a supplement and approval by FDA prior to distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement ($ 314.70(b)). An applicant may ask FDA to expedite its review of a prior approval supplement for public health reasons (e.g., drug shortage) or if a delay in making the change described in it would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement - Expedited Review Requested ($ 314.70(b)(4)).5 FDA is most likely to grant requests for expedited review based on extraordinary hardship for manufacturing changes made necessary by catastrophic events (e.g., fire) or by events that could not be reasonably foreseen and for which the applicant could not plan.\n\nFootnote 5: Internal Agency policies and procedures relating to processing requests for expedited review of supplements to approved ANDAs and NDAs are documented in CDER\u2019s Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) at 5240.1 and 5310.3, respectively. MAPPs can be located on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/mapp.htm.\n\nA moderate change is a change that has a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. There are two types of moderate change. One type of moderate change requires the submission of a supplement to FDA at least 30 days before the distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Supplement - Changes Being Effected in 30 Days ($ 314.70(c)(3)). The drug product made using a moderate change cannot be distributed if FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that a prior approval supplement is required ($ 314.70(c)(5)(i)). For each change, the supplement must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and must include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change ($ 314.70(a)(2) and (c)(4)). If FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that information is missing, distribution must be delayed until the supplement has been amended to provide the missing information ($ 314.70(c)(5)(ii)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8557673692703247", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

This guidance document represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on changes in labeling of approved abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) following revisions in the RLD\u2019s labeling. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes, regulations, or both.\n\nRevising ANDA Labeling Following\n\nRevision of the RLD Labeling\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) in deciding when and how to submit labeling supplements following labeling revisions to their reference listed drugs (RLDs).\n\nII Background\n\nDuring the marketing life of a drug product approved under a new drug application (NDA), the package insert labeling is frequently revised. When an NDA serves as an RLD for an ANDA, approved changes in the RLD labeling generally necessitate changes in the labeling of one or more ANDAs using the RLD. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and Agency regulations, an ANDA product must have the same labeling as the RLD. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(v) of the Act states that an abbreviated application for a new drug must contain\n\ninformation to show that the labeling proposed for the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed drug...except for changes required because of differences approved under a petition...or because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or distributed by different manufacturers.\n\nSimilar statements are also found in the regulations at 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8)(iv).\n\nPreviously, OGD notified the appropriate ANDA sponsors when the approved labeling of their RLD changed. This was usually done using a formal supplement request letter. In cases where an NDA served as the RLD for multiple generic products, the preparation ofa large number of request letters took a significant amount of review staff time. With the increase in the numbers of approved NDAs and ANDAs, this approach was using an increasingly disproportionate share of OGD's resources. Because of the time it took, the approach sometimes even delayed the notification of ANDA sponsors. With the exception of a few special situations (noted below), OGD is no longer providing this type of notification. The sponsor of an ANDA is now responsible for ensuring that the labeling contained in its application is the same as the currently approved labeling of the RLD. OGD has determined that this change in responsibility is necessary to minimize the implementation time for the introduction of revised labeling into the market place. OGD believes that prompt revision, submission to the Agency, and implementation of revised labeling are important to ensure the continued safe and effective use of generic drug products. Because the regulations state that the labeling of the generic must be the same as the innovator, the revision should be made at the very earliest time possible. If there is any potential delay in the revision of a generic drug labeling, the sponsor should contact OGD.\n\n3 How to obtain information on a change in RLD labeling\n\nThe sponsor of an ANDA should routinely monitor the Labeling Review Branch Homepage (see below) for information on changes in labeling. OGD's Labeling Review Branch will:\n\nPlace monthly updates of approved labeling changes for RLDs with approved ANDAs on the Labeling Review Branch Homepage at: http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/rld/labeling_review_branch.html\n\nContinue to notify ANDA applicants by facsimile, telephone, and/or letter for any labeling revision approved for the RLD that warrants immediate widespread professional notification, such as those changes connected to issuing a Dear Doctor Letter or similar significant changes.\n\nAll approved labeling for RLDs is still available from Freedom of Information Staff. Sponsors who wish to obtain labeling using this mechanism should send a written or facsimile request to:\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nFreedom of Information Staff (HFI-35)\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-827-6500; FAX: 301-443-1726\n\nWhen a labeling revision is needed, the ANDA sponsor should take appropriate action to revise the ANDA labeling and submit the revised labeling to the FDA.\n\nHow to submit revised labeling\n\nAll ANDA labeling changes needed because of approved changes to the labeling of the RLD may be submitted as a Special Supplement - Changes Being Effected. Such supplements should include:\n\n12 copies of final printed labeling\n\nthe date the revised labeling will be used (go into effect)\n\na side-by-side comparison of the ANDA labeling with the approved labeling of the RLD with all differences annotated and explained, as described in 21 CFR 314.94 (a)(8)(iv)\n\nSponsors should contact the OGD Labeling Review Branch at 301-827-5846 if there are any questions about the information in this guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Revising ANDA Labeling Following Revision of the RLD Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6283471584320068", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain changes (e.g., change in strength, change in composition of the product in relation to the reference listed drug (RLD)) may not be permitted in an ANDA without prior FDA approval of the change (see 21 CFR 314.93).\n\nWhen an NDA or an ANDA is submitted, the applicant is required in FDA Form 356(h) to provide a complete listing of all the manufacturing, packaging, and control sites for drug substance and drug product and provide information on readiness of each site for inspection (see 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)). If at the time of inspection the facility is not ready, the application may not be approved. The inspector will be aware of the application and any amendments to it at the time of the inspection.\n\nAfter an application is approved, 21 CFR part 212 permits an applicant to change equipment provided that it is qualified before use. Under FDA regulations at 21 CFR 314.70, certain changes after approval must be requested in a prior approval supplement (PAS). If a PAS is required and an inspection requested, FDA would seek to perform the inspection as soon as possible.\n\nIn preparation for the inspection, an amendment to the application that describes the changes and provides supporting data will need to be submitted. Whenever an amendment is submitted, a field copy (with certification) must also be submitted to inform the inspector of changes (see 21 CFR 314.70(a)(5); see also Appendix B).\n\nQ5: Can we submit an ANDA on CD? If so, do we need to submit a paper copy as back up?\n\nInformation on electronic submission on physical media is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM163567.pdf.\n\nIt is not necessary to submit a paper copy of the entire submission as a back up. However, if you are submitting on physical media (e.g., a CD or DVD), you should submit a paper FDA Form 356h with original signatures. FDA requires this hard copy document in the unlikely event that the physical media are damaged or corrupted and rendered unreadable. Without the paper document, FDA would not be able to contact the sponsor if the physical media are unreadable.\n\nQ6: Will hybrid applications be accepted?\n\nYes. CDER's Electronic Submissions Group (ESub Group) will grant waivers for hybrid applications for PET producers. The ESub group will provide instructions to sponsors and advise which forms and templates to use. The ESub group can be contacted at\n\nESub@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nIs there a way to determine whether a PET producer has submitted an NDA or ANDA for approval or has received approval of an application? There is no public list of submitted NDAs or ANDAs. FDA cannot publicly disclose the existence of an NDA or ANDA before it is approved unless the applicant has publicly disclosed the existence of the application (see 21 CFR 314.430(b)). Once a product is approved, it is listed in FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book). If you intend to purchase PET drugs for commercial use from a producer of those drugs, you should seek assurance from the vendor that they have submitted an application to FDA.\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs,_ provides reference to and advice to format an application in the common technical document (CTD) format. The attachments to the guidance, which provide sample formats, are not formatted according to the CTD. What is the correct format for the CTD? The sample formats have been kept in the old Office of Generic Drug (OGD) format to avoid confusion for the three commonly used drugs (FDG, Ammonia N13, and Sodium Fluoride F18). You may organize the application in the CTD format and keep the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) sections (module 3 of the CTD format) as formatted in the CMC attachment. Alternatively, you can organize the application, including CMC, entirely in CTD format. The following FDA guidances provide further information about the CTD format: * _Submitting Marketing Applications According to the ICH-CTD Format\n\nGeneral Considerations3 Footnote 3: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic. * International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidance, _M4: Organization of the CTD * ICH guidance on _M4Q: The CTD -\n\nIf the drug substance and the drug product are the same, do applicants have to repeat the information in the two sections of the CTD? No. You do not have to repeat information if the drug product and substance are the same. You can hyperlink to the section where the information is provided.\n\nWhat are the differences between Module 3 for the NDA and ANDA?The modules are the same.\n\nQ11:: Would FDA consider an application for FDG for a concentration greater than 300 millicuries (mCi)/milliliter (mL) and perhaps as high as 500 mCi/mL?\n\nFDA has not placed any limit on the strength for the multidose vial. As long as the data support manufacturability and stability of the product at the proposed strength, FDA will consider the application. Be advised that if the proposed strength is not in the mCi/mL range approved for the RLD, a suitability petition or a 505(b)(2)4 NDA must be submitted (see 21 CFR 314.93). For further information on acceptable ranges, see the guidance PET Drug Applications - Content and Format for NDAs and ANDAs.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 U.S.C. 355(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act).\nQ12:: Has FDA considered establishing a few different queues for PET applications?\n\nNo, FDA has developed internal tracking procedures specifically for PET products, but we do not believe that a different queue is necessary.\n\nQ13:: If we use two different synthesizers to make the same product, do we need to submit two NDAs or ANDAs?\n\nYou can have two different synthesizers in the same NDA or ANDA as long as the finished product at the end is the same, meaning that the product meets the same set of specifications and the formulation is the same. If the finished product formulation from the two synthesizers is different, two separate applications may need to be submitted. Please contact the Office of Generic Drugs (for an ANDA) or the Office of New Drugs' Division of Medical Imaging Products (for an NDA) to discuss your options. However, in certain cases, a formulation that differs in terms of exception excipients (e.g., a buffer, an antioxidant or a stabilizer) may be submitted within the same ANDA; otherwise, sameness to the RLD must be shown.\nQ14:: How much does FDA want to see in an application about the parameters and the controls on the cyclotron itself?\n\nInformation about the operating parameters for cyclotron operation (e.g., the make of cyclotron used, bombardment times, information on the target, and the target windows), should be submitted. This information may be submitted by a reference to a Type-II Drug Master File (DMF) if the isotope is obtained from outside sources. When buying isotopes from a vendor, appropriate specifications should be established and the vendor should be qualified.\n\nWill FDA treat foreign producers who seek to export PET drug products into the United States differently than domestic producers? No, FDA will not treat foreign PET drug product producers differently than domestic producers. In addition to other applicable requirements, all foreign drug establishments whose products are imported or offered for import into the United States are required to register their establishment with FDA and list all of their drug products in commercial distribution in the United States. More information on the registration and listing process is available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/DrugRegistration andListing/ucm2007058.htm.\n\nINDs\n\nWho can sponsor an IND? INDs can be sponsored by an individual (e.g., a physician), an institution, or a company.\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs_.\n\nWill drugs for which there is a United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) monograph be exempt from submitting an IND? No. The fact that a drug has a USP monograph does not eliminate the need for an IND, although the drug might be eligible for an expanded access IND if the criteria are met (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs).\n\nWhat is the definition of clinical use in the context of PET drugs?Clinical use refers to administration of the drug to patients as a component of their clinical care with no intent to study the safety or effectiveness of the drug in any systematic way.\nQ20: Can research be conducted under an IND for FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18, or Rubidium Chloride Rb82?\n\nYes. Research and/or investigational studies using these drugs should be conducted under an IND if they are being studied for purposes of commercial clinical use (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs). Human research using a PET drug may be conducted under the RDRC if it is basic science research and not research that is intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes, or research to determine the safety and effectiveness of the radioactive drug or biological product for such purposes (see the guidance The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application).\nQ21: In submitting the physician-sponsored IND, one of the biggest hurdles is trying to get the necessary preclinical pharmacological and toxicology data to support the submission. Would FDA consider reducing the requirement?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.3177173137664795", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis is one in a series of guidance documents intended to assist applicants making regulatory submissions to FDA in electronic format. Agency guidance documents on electronic submissions will be updated regularly to reflect the evolving nature of the technology and the experience of those using this technology.\n\nThe Agency is adopting new technology for processing and managing labeling and labeling changes, including the content of labeling submitted electronically. This guidance describes how to submit the content of labeling using the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) standard, which is based on extensible markup language (XML).\n\nThis guidance discusses issues related to the submission of the content of labeling in electronic format for marketing applications for human drug and biologic products, including new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and biological license applications (BLAs) for biological products that meet the definition of drug in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The content of labeling is the labeling required under 21 CFR 201.100(d)(3) including all text, tables, and figures (commonly referred to as the package insert or professional labeling). This guidance applies to the content of labeling provided with original submissions, supplements, and annual reports. Copies of the formatted label and labeling and specimens of enclosures required elsewhere in the regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 314.50(e)(2)(ii)), including carton and container labels, must still be submitted either electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) or on paper.\n\nFor a list of guidances that are under development on electronic submissions, see the guidance Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format -- General Considerations.2 The general considerations guidance also addresses issues (e.g., appropriate file formats, media, and submission procedures) that are common to all submission types.\n\nFootnote 2: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm and the CBER guidance page at http://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.htm.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Electronic Labeling Rule\n\nOn December 11, 2003, FDA published final regulations (the electronic labeling rule) requiring the submission of the content of labeling in electronic format for marketing applications (68 FR 69009). The requirements of the electronic labeling rule can be found in SS 314.50(l) for NDAs, SS 314.94(d) for ANDAs, SS 601.14(b) for BLAs, and SS 314.81(b) for annual reports to marketing applications. The effective date of the rule was June 8, 2004. The regulations specify that the content of labeling must be submitted electronically in a form that FDA can process, review, and archive. The regulations also state that FDA will periodically issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission. This guidance provides information on how to submit the content of labeling in electronic format.\n\nNew Technology for Processing Labeling\n\nand Labeling Changes\n\nThe regulations require that the content of labeling be submitted in a form that we (FDA) can process, review, and archive. Since 1999, FDA has been receiving the electronic content of labeling in Portable Document Format (PDF), and this format has allowed us to process, review and archive the content of labeling. Recently, however, recommendations from the Institute of Medicine and the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and mandates in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173) have created a new role for electronic labeling information. Electronically formatted content of labeling will be used to support health information management technologies such as electronic prescribing; the electronic health record (EHR), which will provide health care providers, patients, and other authorized users access to patient information in electronic format; and the DailyMed, a new way to distribute up-to-date and comprehensive medication information in a computerized format for use in health care information systems.\n\nWe have determined that our current procedures using PDF are not adequate to support these electronic initiatives. To support the new programs, the Agency is changing the way it processes, reviews, and archives the content of labeling. The Agency is adopting a new technology for exchanging information between computer systems based on Clinical Document Architecture (CDA). CDA was developed by Health Level Seven (HL7), a standards development organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). CDA allows information to be exchanged in extensible markup language (XML) and is the standard being investigated for the EHR.\n\nFDA, working with other parties in HL7 (experts from HL7, industry, and technology solution providers), has adapted CDA for labeling in an HL7 standard called Structured Product Labeling (SPL). When compared with PDF, SPL exhibits the following advantages.\n\nSPL allows the exchange of information between computer systems in a way that cannot be accomplished with PDF. For example, the information in SPL can be used to support health information technology initiatives for improving patient care.\n\nThe exchange of labeling changes with SPL can be easier and more efficient for both FDA and manufacturers when compared with PDF. For example, with SPL, only those sections or data elements of the labeling that are changed would need to be checked rather than the entire labeling.\n\nSPL allows automation of comparison of text by section and comparison of specific drug information data elements.\n\nSPL can also be used to exchange information needed for other submissions, such as drug listing, thus eliminating redundant data collection and improving efficiency.\n\nThe Agency is developing an automated system using SPL for processing and managing labeling and labeling changes. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has identified SPL in public docket number 92S-0251 as a format that FDA can use to process, review, and archive the content of labeling. During our transition to the automated system, the Agency is able to accept the content of labeling in either PDF or SPL file format. After the automated system is implemented, PDF will no longer be a format that we can use to process, review, and archive the content of labeling.

This guidance provides recommendations on procedures, content, and format for submitting a postmarketing study commitment status report for an approved human drug or licensed biological product. This guidance also describes the FDA's obligations to make certain information about postmarketing study commitments public, including the type of information that will be made public and the FDA's time frames for reviewing postmarketing study commitment final reports.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nLegislative History of Postmarketing Study Commitment Status Reports\n\nSection 130(a) of Title I of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act), signed into law on November 21, 1997, added section 506B (Reports ofPostmarketing Studies) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \"Act\") (21 U.S.C. 356b). Section 506B gives the FDA additional authority for monitoring the progress of postmarketing studies that drug and biologics applicants (\"you\") have agreed to or are required to conduct. On October 30, 2000, the FDA issued final regulations implementing that law (65 FR 64607). The regulations went into effect on April 30, 2001 (66 FR 10815), and FDA issued a draft guidance related to the rule in April 2001. This final guidance complements the rule by describing in greater detail the content, format, and timing of the postmarketing study commitment reports required by section 506B. The guidance also discusses reporting of other postmarketing studies not subject to section 506B.\n\nIf you are required by the FDA, or if you have entered into an agreement with the FDA, to conduct a postmarketing study concerning clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology, you are required to provide the Agency with an annual report on the status of the study until the FDA notifies you, in writing, that the Agency concurs with your determination that the study commitment has been fulfilled or that the study either is no longer feasible or would no longer provide useful information. This annual report must address the progress of the study or the reasons for your failure to conduct the study (21 U.S.C. 356b(a); 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) and 601.70(b)).\n\nSection 506B also requires the FDA to make certain information available to the public about postmarketing study commitments, and your progress in completing those studies. More specifically, under section 506B(c), the FDA must develop and publish annually in the Federal Register a report on the status of postmarketing study commitments that you have agreed to or are required to conduct and for which annual status reports have been submitted (21 U.S.C. 356b(c)). Section 506B(b) indicates that any information necessary to identify you as the applicant of a study and establish the status of a study and the reasons, if any, for any failure to carry out the study, is considered to be public information (21 U.S.C. 356b(b)).\n\n2 Regulations for Reporting Postmarketing Studies\n\nThe regulations implementing section 506B of the Act apply to both human drug products and licensed biological products (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) and 601.70). These regulations are summarized as follows:\n\nApplicants are required to file postmarketing study commitment status reports (506B reports) for studies that the FDA has required an applicant to conduct or that an applicant has agreed, in writing, to conduct, provided that the study concerns a product's clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology (506B studies). Information from 506B reports will be included in the Agency's annual Federal Register report and on the postmarketing study commitments Web site.2 Footnote 2: http://www.fda.gov/cder/pmc\n\nThe regulations apply to 506B studies for all approved applications, with no exception for products that are not actively marketed.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nyou are required to conduct provided that the study concerns a product's clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology.\n* A postmarketing study might be conducted because you and the FDA agree, in writing, that one or more such study should be conducted. These agreements can be made at the time of approval or after the FDA grants marketing approval to your drug. If you and the FDA agree at the time of drug approval that a postmarketing study should be performed, the study will likely be used to provide additional information about product risks, benefits, and/or optimal use. If you and the FDA determine after approval of the drug that a postmarketing study should be performed, the study will generally be used to address a safety concern that has been identified during the post-approval use of the drug. You must file 506B reports for postmarketing study commitments that you agreed, in writing, to conduct provided that the study concerns a product's clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology, and provided that the study commitment is not a CMC commitment.\n* Frequently, postmarketing CMC studies are conducted because applicants agree, in writing, to conduct such studies to ensure the consistency and reliability of product quality (e.g., strength, purity, and potency). CMC commitments are not subject to 506B's reporting requirements, although 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) requires you to advise the FDA on the status of CMC commitments in another section of your annual report.\n* Product stability studies are conducted to determine the appropriate expiration date for drug products (21 CFR 211.166). Product stability studies are not subject to 506B's reporting requirements, although 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) requires you to advise the FDA on the status of all product stability studies in another section of your annual report.\n* A voluntary study can be conducted on an applicant's own initiative for a variety of reasons, such as the evaluation of a new indication, a new delivery system for a drug, a new container or closure system, or a new formulation. Voluntary studies are not subject to 506B's reporting requirements, although 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) requires you to advise the FDA on the status of voluntary studies in another section of your annual report.\n\nSummary of the Final Rule that Implements Section 506B\n\n1.1.1 Human Drug Products\n\nThe final rule amended 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) to implement section 506B. Under this section, you must provide the FDA with annual 506B reports on each 506B study annually until we notify you, in writing, that the FDA concurs with your determination that the study commitment has been fulfilled, or that the study is either no longer feasible or would no longer provide useful information. This provision will apply in rare cases to the holder of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Reports on the Status of Postmarketing Study Commitments \u2014 Implementation of Section 130 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.739497184753418"], "Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nQ & A\n\nContent and Format of INDs for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including\n\nWell-Characterized, Therapeutic,\n\nBiotechnology-Derived Products\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biological Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOctober 2000\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Pharmacology and Toxicology staff, Office of Review Management ORM), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) in the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nQ & A on\n\nContent and Format of INDs for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-Derived Products\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administrations current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes, regulations, or both.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to clarify when sponsors should submit final, quality-assured toxicology reports and/or update the Agency on any changes in findings since submission of non-quality-assured reports or reports based on non-quality-assured data.\n\nIn November 1995, FDA published a guidance for industry entitled Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-Derived Products. The guidance states that\n\nIf final, fully quality-assured individual study reports are not available at the time of IND submission, an integrated summary report of toxicologic findings based on the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of completed animal studies may be submitted... [...] full toxicology department individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, and individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, as final, fully quality-assured documents within 120 days of the start of the human study... [emphasis added].\n\nIf the integrated summary is based upon unaudited draft reports, sponsors should submit an update to their integrated summary 120 days after the start of the human study(ies)...2There has been some confusion over when the 120-day clock starts, specifically, whether it means 120 days after the start of the clinical trial, or 120 days after the submission of the toxicology information.\n\nQ: How does FDA measure the start of the 120-day period within which sponsors should submit updates to their integrated summaries?\n\nA: The Agency measures the 120-day period based on the Agency's receipt (date of receipt\n\nstamped on the IND submission) of the integrated summary report including the toxicology\n\ninformation. If the sponsor does not submit the final, quality-assured report and update at this\n\ntime, the sponsor should make the final, quality-assured report available upon the request of the\n\nAgency and update the Agency on any changes in the findings. In any case, the final, quality-\n\nassured report should be submitted with the NDA.\n\nThe Agency believes that 120 days from submission of an integrated toxicology summary should\n\nprovide sponsors with adequate time to complete a final, quality-assured document. Because the\n\nAgency assumes that clinical studies will generally be initiated immediately following the initial 30-day\n\nclock (or upon submission of the protocol for an existing IND), the intention of the 120-day allowance\n\nis to encourage the initiation of clinical studies by, in effect, allowing earlier submissions of clinical\n\nprotocols based on unaudited reports.\n--------------------\nContext title: Content and Format of INDs for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-Derived Products. Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry Q&A\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6261618733406067", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.2.2 Pharmacology Toxicology\n\nSponsors of monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should consider the following pharmacology toxicology recommendations:\n\nThe Agency intends to be flexible regarding selected nonclinical safety data submission expectations (e.g., timing of data submission to the IND) for monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 to support clinical trial initiation. The degree of flexibility warranted will be influenced by the benefit-risk assessment for the intended population (e.g., hospitalized, nonhospitalized, healthy trial subjects) and the potential coverage of important emerging variants. Thus, FDA strongly recommends that sponsors discuss the nonclinical requirements to support product administration in a specific clinical trial with the Agency through the pre-IND consultation process.11 Footnote 11: See the guidance for industry and investigators COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: General Considerations for Pre-IND Meeting Requests for COVID-19 Related Drugs and Biological Products (May 2020).\n\nNonclinical safety assessment for monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should follow approaches outlined in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Delivered Pharmaceuticals (May 2012) and conduct the following:\n\nA tissue cross reactivity (TCR) study using a panel of human tissues.12 When a monoclonal antibody binds to human tissues in the TCR study, FDA recommends evaluating monoclonal antibody binding to select tissues from nonclinical species to assist in species selection for repeat-dose toxicology testing. When binding of potential clinical concern is observed (e.g., cell membrane binding), FDA\nrecommends discussing these data with the Agency because additional studies may be needed to help inform the potential clinical relevance of the findings. * A short duration (i.e., 3 weeks of treatment) repeat-dose toxicology study in a single species, using the clinical formulation and route of administration(s) intended for clinical administration, that includes all standard toxicity endpoints including toxicokinetic analysis. FDA also recommends discussing specific study design considerations with the Agency.\n\nToxicology studies with specific monoclonal antibody combinations are not needed for monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins, so monoclonal antibody products can be evaluated separately in toxicology studies. If a sponsor evaluates monoclonal antibody products in combination, FDA recommends using the same ratio intended for clinical administration.\n\nTo support administration of monoclonal antibody products during pregnancy, FDA recommends conducting a TCR study using relevant human tissues or studies using alternative protein interaction technologies, with appropriate justification. If no specific concerns are identified in the repeat-dose toxicology and TCR studies, developmental and reproductive toxicology studies are not needed.\n\n3.1.3 Virology\n\nSponsors of monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should consider the following virology recommendations:\n\nA broad approach should initially be used to characterize the impact of amino acid changes, insertions, or deletions throughout the monoclonal antibody target protein to identify regions where changes specifically impact monoclonal antibody binding or activity, and subsequent analyses and surveillance can focus on these regions.\n\nSponsors should monitor SARS-CoV-2 genomic databases continually for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and should evaluate phenotypically any specific variants that are prevalent or becoming prevalent that harbor substitutions in or near the target epitope. The sponsor should conduct a more thorough analysis to include other substitutions at the same amino acid positions.\n\nSponsors should characterize the epitopes to which monoclonal antibody products bind to enable identification of polymorphisms, which may affect binding, and to inform decisions regarding monoclonal antibody products planned for use in a combination therapy.\n\nSponsors should characterize monoclonal antibody products with respect to epitope binding (affinity equilibrium dissociation constant (K({}_{\\text{D}})) and noncompetitive binding). The sponsor should characterize the mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (e.g., blocking spike protein/receptor binding domain interaction with ACE2).\n\nThe sponsor should determine the neutralizing activity (half maximal effective concentration (EC({}_{50})) value) of investigational monoclonal antibody products, individually and if applicable in combination, against an array of circulating variants representing the diversity of the target protein and epitope to which the monoclonal antibody binds.\n\nThe sponsor should evaluate the neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies, individually and if applicable in combination, against SARS-CoV-2 variants or pseudovirus harboring substitutions known to confer reduced susceptibility to other authorized or approved antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 or pseudovirus should be serially passaged in cell culture in the presence of the monoclonal antibody product, individually and if applicable in combination, to select for resistant variants to understand the potential risk and nature of treatment-emergent resistance. Sponsors should characterize genotypically and phenotypically the variants selected in this manner. Sponsors should determine the effect of resistance-associated substitutions on approved and authorized monoclonal antibody products. These studies should be conducted under appropriate biocontainment.13 Footnote 13: For biosafety considerations from the National Institutes of Health, which may be relevant for some research, see the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules and the FAQs \u2014 Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidance for Research with SARS-CoV-2 and IBC Requirements under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules available at https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/nih-guidelines/. See also the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s guideline Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories available at https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL_html.\n\nClinical protocols should include detailed plans to (1) characterize the impact of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability on clinical and virologic outcomes (i.e., baseline resistance analyses) and (2) identify SARS-CoV-2 genetic changes associated with treatment (i.e., treatment-emergent resistance analyses).\n\nSponsors should also reference the guidance for industry COVID-19: Developing Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention (February 2021) and the guidance for industry Antiviral Product Development -- Conducting and Submitting Virology Studies to the Agency (June 2006).\n\nClinical Sponsors of monoclonal antibody products targeting SARS-CoV-2 should consider the following clinical recommendations:\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]\n--------------------\nContext title: Development of Monoclonal Antibody Products Targeting SARS-CoV-2, Including Addressing the Impact of Emerging Variants, During the COVID 19 Public Health Emergency\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.825270891189575", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: [The following pharmacology and toxicology guidance is applicable to all phases of IND development of products covered by this guidance.]\n\n1 Pharmacology and Drug Distribution [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(i)]:\n\nThis section should contain, if known: 1) a description of the pharmacologic effects and mechanism(s) of actions of the drug in animals, and 2) information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretions of the drug. The regulations do not further describe the presentation of these data, in contrast to the more detailed description of how to submit toxicologic data. A summary report, without individual animal records or individual study results, usually suffices. In most circumstances, five pages or less should suffice for this summary. If this information is not known, it should simply be so stated.\n\nTo the extent that such studies may be important to address safety issues, or to assist in evaluation of toxicology data, they may be necessary; however, lack of this potential effectiveness information should not generally be a reason for a Phase 1 IND to be placed on clinical hold.\n\n2 Toxicology: Integrated Summary [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(ii)(a)]\n\nPresent regulations require an integrated summary of the toxicologic effects of the drug in animals and in vitro. The particular studies needed depend on the nature of the drug and the phase of human investigation. When species specificity, immunogenicity, or other considerations appear to make many or all toxicological models irrelevant, sponsors are encouraged to contact the agency to discuss toxicological testing.\n\nThe regulations are not specific as to the nature of the report of toxicology data needed in an IND submission and the nature of the study reports upon which the report submitted to the IND is based. The regulations are silent on whether the submitted material should be based on: 1) \"final fully quality-assured\" individual study reports, or 2) earlier, unaudited draft toxicologic reports of the completed study(ies). Most sponsors have concluded that a submission based on final fully quality-assured individual study reports is required, and a substantial delay in submission of an IND for several months is often encountered to complete such final fully quality-assured individual reports from the time the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of the completed studies are prepared.\n\nMoreover, although the regulation does not specifically require individual toxicology study reports to be submitted, referring only to an integrated summary of the toxicologic findings, the requirement at 21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(ii)(b) for a full tabulation of data from each study suitable for detailed review has led most sponsors to provide detailed reports of each study.\n\nAlthough the GLP and quality assurance processes and principles are critical for the maintenance of a toxicology study system that is valid and credible, it is unusual, as far as FDA is aware, for findings in the unaudited draft toxicologic report of the completed studies to change during the production of the \"final,\" quality-assured individual study reports in ways important to determining whether use in humans is safe.\n\nTherefore, if final, fully quality-assured individual study reports are not available at the time of IND submission, an integrated summary report of toxicologic findings based on the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of the completed animal studies may be submitted. This integrated summary report should represent the sponsor's evaluation of the animal studies that formed the basis for the sponsor's decision that the proposed human studies are safe. It is expected that the unaudited draft reports that formed the basis of this decision might undergo minor modifications during final review and quality assurance auditing. Full toxicology department individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, and individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, as final, fully quality-assured documents within 120 days of the start of the human study for which the animal study formed part of the safety conclusion basis. These final reports should contain in the introduction any changes from those reported in the integrated summary. If there are no changes, that should be so stated clearly at the beginning of the final, fully quality-assured report.\n\nIf the integrated summary is based upon unaudited draft reports,sponsors should submit an update to their integrated summary by 120 days after the start of the human study(ies) identifying any differences found in the preparation of the final fully quality- assured study reports and the information submitted in the initial integrated summary. If there were no differences found, that should be stated in the integrated summary update.\n\nIn addition, any new finding discovered during the preparation of the final, fully quality-assured individual study reports that could affect subject safety must be reported to FDA under 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nUsually, 10 to 15 pages of text with additional tables (as needed) should suffice for the integrated summary. It should represent the sponsor's perspective on the completed animal studies at the time the sponsor decided human trials were appropriate. Use of visual data displays (e.g., box plots, stem and leaf displays, histograms or distributions of lab results over time) will facilitate description of the findings of these trials.\n\nThe summary document should be accurate contemporaneously with the IND submission (i.e., it should be updated so that if new information or findings from the completed animal studies have become known since the sponsor's decision that the proposed human study is safe, such new information should also be included in the submitted summary).\n\nThe integrated summary of the toxicologic findings of the completed animal studies to support the safety of the proposed human investigation should ordinarily contain the following information:\n\na. A brief description of the design of the trials and any deviations from the design in the conduct of the trials. In addition, the dates of the performance of the trials should be included. Reference to the study protocol and protocol amendments may suffice for some of this information. b. A systematic presentation of the findings from the animal toxicology and toxicokinetic studies. Those findings that an informed and experienced expert would reasonably consider as possible signals of human risk should be highlighted. The format of this part of the summary may be approached from a \"systems review\" perspective: (e.g., CNS, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, genitourinary, hematopoietic and immunologic, and dermal). If a product's effects on a particular body system have not been assessed, that should be so noted. If any well-documented toxicological \"signal\" is not considered evidence of human risk, the reason should be given. In addition, the sponsor should note whether these findings are discussed in the investigator's brochure.\n* Identification and qualifications of the individual(s) who evaluated the animal safety data and concluded that it is reasonably safe to begin the proposed human study. This person(s) should sign the summary attesting that the summary accurately reflects the animal toxicology data from the completed studies.\n* A statement of where the animal studies were conducted and where the records of the studies are available for inspection, should an inspection occur.\n* As required under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(iii), a declaration that each study subject to good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations was performed in full compliance with GLPs or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with those regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance and the sponsor's view on how such noncompliance might affect the interpretations of the findings.\n\nNOTE: The information described in paragraphs \"c\", \"d\", and \"e\" may be supplied as part of the integrated summary or as part of the full data tabulations described below.\n\n3 Toxicology - Full Data Tabulation [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(ii)(b)]:\n\nThe sponsor should submit, for each animal toxicology study that is intended to support the safety of the proposed clinical investigation, a full tabulation of data suitable for detailed review. This should consist of line listings of the individual data points, including laboratory data points, for each animal in these trials along with summary tabulations of these data points. To allow interpretation of the line listings, accompanying the line listingsshould be either: 1) a brief (usually a few pages) description (i.e., a technical report or abstract including a methods description section) of the study or 2) a copy of the study protocol and amendments.\n\n4 Toxicology - GLP Certification [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(iii)]:\n\nSee section III.G.2.e. above.\n\n5 Monitoring of Effects of these Clarifications:\n\nAt the end of the first two to three years of this new procedure, FDA will assemble and examine the instances in which the early and later animal study individual reports differed to determine if such differences made a material difference in the safe conduct of human trials. Depending on the outcomes, the acceptability of this approach to reporting toxicology studies to INDs may be re-examined.\n\nPrevious Human Experience with the Investigational Drug [21 CFR 312.23(a)(9)]:\n\nPresent regulations require this information only if there has been previous human experience with the investigational drug. If there has been no previous human experience, the submission should so state.\n\nWhen there has been previous human experience, such experience may be presented in an integrated summary report. Individual study reports should not be routinely submitted.\n\n21 CFR 312.23(a)(10), (11) and (b), (c), (d), and (e) :\n\nNo clarifications.\n\nReferences\n--------------------\nContext title: Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.083179473876953", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: reflected by this document is meant to be an extension and update\n\nof the two references above, and the drug developer should use this\n\ndocument, and direct guidance from DAVDP reviews, as specific\n\nguidance for developing drugs to be reviewed by DAVDP.\n\nAll nonclinical toxicity studies conducted for the purpose of\n\nsupporting INDs or NDAs must be conducted in accordance with Good\n\nLaboratory Practices (21 CFR 58) and use drug substance prepared\n\naccording to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (21 CFR 210\n\nand 211). The drug used in nonclinical studies should preferably\n\nbe in the same form (the final formulation of the drug product) as\n\nthat intended for human use, especially in those circumstances in\n\nwhich the effect of the final formulation of the drug is or could\n\nbe a major determinant of the drug's toxicity.\n\nb. Pharmacokinetics\n\nThe absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME)\n\nof a drug should be adequately studied as part of its preclinical development. In general, the sponsor should develop analytical methodology for quantifying systemic and tissue levels of the drug and its primary metabolites. The drug's ADME profile should be a primary determinant of the design and interpretation of animal toxicity studies for that drug, including the choice of test spc_dies, route of administration, dose-range and schedule of administration, histopathology and clinical pathology measurements, and the need to include additional observations in the study design. As discussed below, ADME data are important for justifying the route of administration used in animal toxicity studies when the investigator plans to use a route of administration other than that proposed for human use.\n\nFor topically applied drugs, the systemic absorption of the drug product should be determined in animals using models representative of the clinical use of the topical drug preparation.\n\nc. Single-dose acute toxicity studies\n\nTo support first-time use of a new drug in humans the single-dose acute toxicity of the drug should be determined in at least three animal species, at least one being a non-rodent. Acute toxicity studies are intended to provide information about the toxicity produced by a single administration of the drug. As discussed above, these are not classical LD-50 or acute lethality tests.\n\nThe drug should be administered by the same route of administration as that intended for use in humans, in addition to IV administration if that is not the intended route of administration.\n\nd. Repeat-dose Toxicity Studies\n\nTo support clinical studies in which a new drug will be given in repeated administrations for up to one month, the drug's toxicity should be evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies of at least 4-weeks duration. Two animal species should be tested, at least one being a non-rodent. The dose-range used in these studies should be chosen to enable each toxicity study to identify the highest non-toxic dose as well as allow a thorough qualitative and quantitative characterization of the drug's toxicity. Usually, a minimum of three doses are used for these studies, with the highest dose producing overt toxicity and the lowest showing no toxicity. The middle dose should be chosen to best facilitate calculating the dose-response relationship of the drug's toxicity.\n\nThe route of administration used for repeat-dose animal toxicity studies should be the same as that proposed for human use of the drug. If the human route of administration can not be duplicated in the animal, then alternative routes can be proposed to DAVDP. As discussed above, supporting ADME data for the test species are often necessary for justifying that the ADME profile resulting from the alternative route of administration will be adequate for the purposes of studying the drug's toxicity.\n\nAnother important point to consider is the schedule of administration of the drug. If the drug is expected to be administered to humans in multiple daily doses, then the dosing schedule in animal toxicity studies should reflect this. The schedule dependency of a drug's toxicity should be a primary consideration in the design of toxicity studies since the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of a drug may change significantly according to its schedule of administration during repeated dosing. If single daily dosing in animals does not allow an adequate characterization of the drug's toxicity to be made, then such studies might not support clinical studies in which the drug is to be used in multiple daily administrations since the toxicity study did not adequately describe the potential toxicity of the drug under conditions similar to its proposed clinical use. Additionally, an accurate description of the drugs's schedule-specific toxicity greatly facilitates choosing the starting dose and schedule for clinical trials.\n\nTo support repeated administration of the drug to humans for longer than one month, the sponsor should evaluate the drug's toxicity in repeat-dose animal toxicity studies of at least 3 months duration in at least two animal species, with at least one being a non-rodent. The same general considerations discussed above for the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity studies also apply to 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies.\n\nFor topical drug preparations, toxicity studies specifically addressing the drug's potential to produce dermal irritation and sensitization should be conducted. Additionally, because of the potential for topically applied drugs to get into the eyes, ophthalmic irritation studies should also be conducted. The overall design of dermal toxicity studies should reflect the manner in which the drug will be used in humans.\n\ne. Immunotoxicology\n\nAn evaluation of the drug's effects on the immune system may be necessary as part of the preclinical development of the new drug. To evaluate the immunotoxicity of a drug, a tiered approach such as that developed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) can be used (Luster et al., Fundamental and Applied Toxicology 10:2-19 1988). The NTP's tiered approach for evaluating immunotoxicity uses a battery of assays in which the first-tier assays constitute a preliminary screen for detecting functional and pathologic effects on the major components of the mammalian immune system.\n\nIt is expected that for most new drugs only the first-tier studies would be needed prior to Phase I studies.\n\nf. Genetic Toxicology\n\nThe genetic toxicity of the drug should be evaluated in a battery of genetic toxicity tests. Because of ongoing developments in the field of genetic toxicology, drug developers are urged to contact DAVDP reviewers for specific guidance concerning genetic toxicity studies for a particular drug so that the current state of scientific knowledge can be applied. In general, however, it is anticipated that no single test will be sufficient to adequately characterize the potential genetic toxicity or carcinogenicity of a new drug. The drug should be tested in a battery of short-term assays that are relevant to the various mechanisms by which genetic damage can occur.\n\ng. General Pharmacology\n\nAn evaluation of the drug's general pharmacological or physiological activity should be performed. This evaluation can be accomplished using established in vitro and in vivo assays that screen for the major types of pharmacological or physiological responses that can be produced as side effects of drugs, such as effects on the central nervous system, autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular system. Because the general pharmacology studies measure drug-induced effects which may not be detected in the other toxicity studies, they are needed to complete the overall profile of the drug's potential toxicity and are intended to complement the animal toxicity studies described above.\n\nHUMAN CLINICAL DATA\n\nIn certain instances, data from prior human use of the drug may exist. Whenever possible these data should be submitted for review by FDA by inclusion in the IND or NDA. Depending on the scientific quality of the data and its relevance to the proposed clinical use, DAVDP may modify the nonclinical toxicology requirements on a case by case basis.\n--------------------\nContext title: Reference Guide for the Nonclinical Toxicity Studies of Antivial Drugs Indicated for the Treatment of N:A Non-Life Threatening Disease Evaluation of Drug Toxicity Prior to Phase I Clinical Studies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.1369428634643555", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: Microdose\n\nRadopharmaceutical\n\nDiagnostic Drugs: Nonclinical Study Recommendations\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nAugust 2018\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors of microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs on the nonclinical studies recommended to support human clinical trials and marketing applications.2 This guidance addresses the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking regarding regulation of this class of drugs and provides complementary recommendations to the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers Exploratory IND (Investigational New Drug Application) Studies (exploratory IND guidance) and the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (ICH M3(R2)).\n\nFootnote 2: As defined by the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers Exploratory IND (Investigational New Drug Application) Studies, a microdose is less than 1/100 of the dose of a test substance calculated (based on animal data) to yield a pharmacologic effect of the test substance with a maximum dose of less than or equal to 100 micrograms ((\\upmu)g). The maximum dose for protein products is less than or equal to 30 nanomoles (nmol). This definition corresponds to approach 1 in Table 3: Recommended Nonclinical Studies to Support Exploratory Clinical Trials in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThis guidance discusses how to refine nonclinical study recommendations for this class of drug given its unique characteristics (e.g., microdose, radiolabeled, single (or infrequent) use, clinical use setting, the Agency's nonclinical and clinical safety experience with these drugs).\n\nThis guidance also is intended to help sponsors facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials, reduce the use of animals with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles, and reduce the use of drug development resources. While both the exploratory IND and the ICH M3(R2) guidancesdescribe recommended nonclinical studies intended to be conducted early in phase 1 exploratory studies of microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the guidances do not address what additional nonclinical studies are recommended for marketing approval. This guidance is intended to provide recommendations for a pathway to full drug development (marketing authorization) for microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs.\n\nAs used in this guidance, a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical drug is (1) a drug that is intended for use in the diagnosis or monitoring of a disease or a manifestation of a disease in humans and that exhibits spontaneous disintegration of unstable nuclei with the emission of nuclear particles or photons or (2) any nonradioactive kit or nuclide generator that is intended to be used in the preparation of such a drug.3 These drugs are used in nuclear medicine procedures, including planar imaging, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and in combination with other radiation detection probes. As technology advances, microdose drugs that use new modalities may emerge. Although this guidance describes recommendations for current radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the general principles discussed could apply to new diagnostic drugs.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 315 and 601.31.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to radioactive drugs for research that are used in accordance with 21 CFR 361.1.4 These issues are addressed in the guidance for industry and researchers The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application.\n\nFootnote 4: A radiolabeled compound without an IND can be administered at doses that are known to have no pharmacologic effect in humans when the compound has been studied in humans and the results of the studies have been published in the literature. These basic research studies should be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board and a radioactive research committee (21 CFR 361.1).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFor radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the microdose evaluated during early clinical trials does not differ significantly from the microdose intended for marketing approval and is less than or equal to 100 micrograms ((\\upmu)g). Because these diagnostic drugs are administered using a dose at the low end of the dose-response curve, dose-related adverse events are unlikely to occur. The Agency recommends that sponsors tailor the amount and type of nonclinical supporting data to account for the low potential for adverse events.\n\nBecause each drug is unique, the Agency encourages sponsors to consult the Division of Medical Imaging Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research before submitting an IND and during drug development. If, at any stage of development, a sponsor determines that particular nonclinical pharmacology or toxicology studies are not needed and provides adequate justification in a waiver request, the Agency may grant a waiver for specific studies.5\n\nFootnote 5: 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nIII Recommendations for Nonclinical Studies\n\nThe Agency recommends that the sponsor schedule the nonclinical studies to facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials (including appropriate safety monitoring based on findings in nonclinical studies) and to reduce unnecessary use of animals and other resources. Nonclinical recommendations for microdose diagnostic radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \\hline\nStudy Type & Phase & Comments \\ \\hline Pharmacology & Before phase 1 & These studies can include in vivo and in vitro pharmacologic characterizations (e.g., receptor/target/off-target profiling, imaging/radiation dosimetry studies). These studies should provide evidence that radiolabeling of an unlabeled moiety does not significantly alter pharmacologic characterizations. The studies should be of sufficient sensitivity to rule out pharmacologic effects at the anticipated clinical dose. \\ \\hline Extended single-dose toxicity in one species (usually a rodent) & Before phase 1 & FDA accepts the use of extended single-dose toxicity studies in animals to support single-dose clinical trials in humans. When a toxicity study is recommended, a sponsor can use a single mammalian species (both sexes). The route of exposure in animals should be the intended clinical route. To establish safety margins, the sponsor should use a formulation that is as similar as possible to the formulation intended for use in clinical trials for marketing approval.* \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIn extended single-dose studies, animals should be observed for 14 days after dosing with an interim necropsy, typically on day 2, and evaluated endpoints should include body weights, clinical signs, clinical chemistries, hematology, and histopathology (high dose and control only if no pathology is seen at the high dose). The sponsor should design the study to establish a dose inducing a minimal toxic effect or, alternatively, establishing a margin of safety. To establish a margin of safety, the sponsor should demonstrate that a large multiple of the proposed human dose (e.g., 100 times the human dose) does not induce adverse effects in the experimental animals. Scaling from animals to humans based on milligram per kilogram for IV or milligram per square meter for oral administration can be used to select the dose for use in the clinical trial. Scaling based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodeling would also be appropriate if such data are available and the suggested dose does not exceed the dose determined from milligram per kilogram or milligram per square meter scaling.\n--------------------\nContext title: Microdose Radiopharmaceutical Diagnostic Drugs- Nonclinical Study Recommendations Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.69923734664917", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nChapter 1 Nonclinical Evaluation of Endocrine-Related Drug Toxicity Guidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4th Floor Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 Tel: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353; Email: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nPharmacology and Toxicology\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNonclinical Evaluation of Endocrine-Related Drug Toxicity\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of New Drugs in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to sponsors of investigational new drug applications, new drug applications, and biologics license applications regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regarding nonclinical studies intended to identify the potential for a drug to cause endocrine-related toxicity.2\n\nFootnote 2: For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs include both human drugs and therapeutic biological products unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe goals of this guidance are to:\n\nDescribe how endocrine-related toxicity is assessed using the standard battery of nonclinical tests\n\nIdentify situations in which additional studies should be considered to more fully characterize the endocrine-related toxicity of a drug\n\nThis guidance focuses on nonclinical testing designed to assess the potential for a drug to cause endocrine effects that are unintentional and adverse. It does not provide guidance relating to the development of drugs that are intended to interfere with the endocrine system to prevent or treat a particular disease or condition, and it does not provide detailed recommendations regarding clinical studies to investigate adverse endocrine-related activity. Environmental assessment issues are not covered in this guidance.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSome compounds can interfere with the endocrine system of an organism or its progeny, resulting in adverse effects in one or more sensitive tissues. Compounds can do this through multiple mechanisms, including: (1) mimicking or enhancing the action of an endogenous hormone; (2) blocking a hormone receptor, thereby preventing the action of an endogenous hormone; or (3) affecting the synthesis, transport, metabolism, or excretion of an endogenous hormone. These effects may be intended, as in the case of oral contraceptives, or they may be an unintended side effect. For biologically significant effects to be produced, exposure needs to be sufficiently high at the target site and the substance needs to be of sufficient potency. It is noted that not all perturbations of the endocrine system are adverse. For pharmaceuticals, only effects seen at clinically relevant exposures are of concern.\n\nTest articles that affect the endocrine system include, but are not limited to, those that alter the function of the sex hormones (e.g., estrogen and androgen), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hormones, and thyroid hormone, and the hormones involved in feedback regulation of endocrine systems (e.g., the gonadotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin). The perturbation of endocrine systems potentially can cause a wide variety of adverse effects on development. Appropriate hormonal exposure during the different developmental stages is critical to normal development. Increased or decreased estrogenic or androgenic activity at inappropriate times can produce transient or permanent alterations in end-organ structure and/or function. For example, animal studies have shown that males exposed to antiandrogens during a specific perinatal period can be demasculinized in morphology, physiology, and behavior.\n\nEndocrine-active compounds also can affect the nervous system through receptors expressed on neuroendocrine cells or on neurons. In rodents, for example, early developmental exposure to estradiol or testosterone establishes permanent sex-dependent brain morphology. Sexual differentiation is also regulated by metabolism of steroid hormones in the brain via enzymes controlling steroidogenesis such as CYP19A1 (P450 aromatase), which converts testosterone to estradiol. For example, in rodents, compounds that alter aromatase activity can cause an imbalance in sex hormones that result in altered sexual behavior.\n\nIt is important to assess drugs being developed for human use for their potential effects on hormonal systems. Nonclinical testing is appropriate for this assessment because endocrine systems are similar among vertebrates, and many species respond similarly with regard to their sensitivity to hormones. Based on review of recent literature and experience with drugs being developed for human use, including those that target the endocrine systems, it is possible to identify potential endocrine effects in drugs not intended to possess those activities. Endocrine effects in patient populations have been successfully predicted by standard nonclinical test batteries. The potential need for additional testing under specific circumstances is discussed in section IV.\n\nIII Overview of Nonclinical Assesssments\n\nAs a part of the safety evaluation of drugs for human use, CDER recommends a standard battery of toxicity tests using study designs intended to identify potential toxicity (see the ICH guidances for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals and S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals).3 A well-designed nonclinical testing program conducted using the recommended paradigm will detect clear adverse effects related to endocrine perturbation by drugs under development. If endocrine effects are identified, other factors -- such as the indication; target population; and route, duration, and level of exposure relative to the expected clinical exposure -- will determine how to proceed (e.g., whether further nonclinical testing or clinical monitoring is appropriate or not warranted).\n\nFootnote 3: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThe typical nonclinical studies conducted during drug development are discussed below, with a focus on the information that the studies can provide about potential endocrine-related toxicity.\n\nReceptor-Binding Assays\n\nBinding assays that include endocrine receptors can serve as an initial screen. A lack of binding does not rule out a potential endocrine effect (e.g., a drug that does not bind to a receptor still could affect synthesis or metabolism of a hormone, resulting in an indirect adverse endocrine effect). Similarly, if binding does occur, this does not provide conclusive evidence that the interaction will lead to a significant biological change. If a drug binds to an endocrine receptor, then additional testing -- including in vitro studies and nonclinical in vivo functional assays -- can be used to characterize the interaction, if warranted.\n\nEnzyme assays also can be used to screen for the potential of a drug to interfere with the endocrine system by altering the activity of certain enzymes. For example, some of the cytochrome P450 isozymes are involved in anabolism and catabolism of steroid hormones. These include CYP 11A1, 11B1, 11B2, 17A1, and 21A1, which act in steroid biosynthesis. Similarly, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase in the liver metabolize circulating thyroid hormones.\n\nPharmacology Studies\n\nSponsors typically conduct nonclinical studies to assess intended pharmacologic effects, including studies on the effects of the drug in in vitro and in vivo models of disease. In some cases, the intended pharmacologic target of the drug can be within an endocrine-related pathway. The pharmacology studies can help characterize this endocrine activity.\n\nRepeat-Dose Toxicity Studies\n\nNonclinical safety assessments for most new drugs include repeat-dose toxicology studies in two species.4 For drugs intended to be used chronically, this typically means studies exposing two animal species to a wide range of doses of the test drug for up to 6 (rodent) or 9 (nonrodent) months. These studies generally include a variety of endpoints that can identify adverse endocrine-related activity. Changes in organ weight, gross organ pathology, clinical chemistry, and histopathology can all be indicative of particular endocrine effects.\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Evaluation of Endocrine-Related Drug Toxicity \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.731000900268555"], "Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProceduralProduct Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -\n\nCompliance Policy\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are availablefrom:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{\\text{th}}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drug/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: (ocod)@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers \"affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce\" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms \u201chomogeneous\u201d and \u201chomogenous\u201d are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term \u201chomogenous\u201d throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product's standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, \"Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA\u2019s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.14424021542072296", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6915342807769775", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.5.1 FDA Regionally Controlled Terminology for Section G.k: Drug(s) Information\n\nFDA currently uses regional controlled terminologies to support ISO IDMP Standards. The FDA regionally controlled terminologies are defined in Section G.k, Drug(s) Information, to support use of FDA regional product identifiers and FDA specialized product categories:\n\nMedicinal Product Identifier (MPID) (ISO 11615:2012)\n\nMedicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source\n\nSubstance/Specified Substance TermID (ISO 11238:2012)\n\nAuthorization/Application Number\n\nPharmaceutical Dosage Form TermID (ISO 11239:2012)\n\nFDA Additional Information on Drug\n\nFDA Specialized Product Category\n\n4.2.5.2 Data Element G.k.2.1.1b: Medicinal Product Identifier (MPID)\n\nThe FDA National Drug Code (NDC), when known, should be used as the regional MPID.23 If the NDC or MPID is unknown, please refer to the E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG. Information about obtaining a list of the NDCs can be found on the NDC Structured Product Labeling Data Elements (\"NDSE\") web page (see https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/nsde).\n\nFootnote 23: The full three segments of the NDC are technically referred to as Packaged Medicinal Product Identifier (PCID) per ISO 11615. Reporters can use either only the first two segments of the NDC or the full NDC as regional MPID in ICSR reporting to FDA.\n\n4.2.5.3 Data Element G.k.2.2: Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source\n\nFDA validates Medicinal Product Names for products marketed in the United States against the available Structured Product Labeling (SPL)24 XML file or the label that was submitted with the ICSR as an attachment. When the product has an SPL file, use the same naming convention in the ICSR as the name appears in the SPL file. When submitting a product label as an attachment to an ICSR, use the name as it appears on the submitted product label.\n\nIf the Medicinal Product Name is not provided but the active substance name is known, provide the active substance as it appears in the FDA SRS Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNII) (see https://precision.fda.gov/unisearch) list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.\n\nIf data element G.k.2.2, Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source, is a foreign product trade name, provide the active substance name as it appears in the FDA SRS UNII list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name. Additionally, provide the foreign product trade name in data element G.k.2.2.\n\n4.2.5.4 Data Element G.k.2.3.r.2b: Substance/Specified Substance TermID\n\nIf the Substance/Specified Substance TermID (data element G.k.2.3.r.2b) is not available, the FDA SRS UNII list should be used to populate data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.\n\nFDA recommends that applicants proactively validate substance information with primary source reporters before preparing the ICSR submission. FDA UNII codes are updated monthly and may be obtained from the FDA SRS UNII list.\n\n4.2.5.5 Data Element G.k.3.1: Authorisation/Application Number\n\nFDA requires the use of a prefix to determine the application type associated with products. For example, for human drug products, include the acronym \"NDA\" or \"ANDA\" immediately followed by the application number with no spaces (e.g., NDA123456, ANDA012345). Table 3 describes format specifications for FDA application numbers and exceptions such as marketed unapproved prescription drug products (use 000000), marketed unapproved nonprescription drug products (use 999999), and compounded products (use COMP99).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline Product Type & FDA Application Type & Recommended Format \\ \\hline Human drug product & NDA/ANDA & NDA123456 or ANDA012345 \\ \\hline Biological product & BLA & BLA123456 \\ \\hline Prescription drug products marketed without an approved application & Rx No Application & 000000 \\ \\hline Non-prescription drug product marketed without an approved application & Non-Rx No Application & 999999 \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: FDA Product and Format Specifications\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]\n\nSubmission Rules\n\nThe submission rules define conditions that will result in a negative acknowledgement and not be accepted by FAERS, if not met.

The tab \"Rejection and Warning Rules\" lists the rejection rules that will result in a negative acknowledgement, and the warning rules that will list a warning but result in positive acknowledgement.\n\nForward Compatibility\n\nThe forward compatibility defines the rules to migrate existing FDA regional E2B(R2) data elements to the FDA regional E2B R3 data elements. The document FDA E2B(R3) Forward Compatible Rules lists the data elements and the rules to be applied when moving from E2B(R2) to E2B(R3) format. Additionally, the guidance for industry Appendix I (B) to the ICH E2B(R3) ICSRs Implementation Guide -- Backwards and Forwards Compatibility (April 2022) should be referenced for data elements whose \"Source\" is ICH.\n\nGeneral Data Completion Instruction\n\nRequired and Optional Data Elements\n\nA required data element is one that needs to be present (i.e., not to be omitted) either in the ICSR message or an instance of a repeating data element section within the ICSR message.\n\nA required data element may or may not allow a nullFlavor, depending on the data validation rules associated with the data element.\n\nAn optional data element generally does not have to be included in the message if it does not have a value. But in some cases, a referential data validation rule may necessitate an optional data element be indicated with a nullFlavor under certain circumstances.\n\nThe FDA E2B(R3) Core and Regional Data Elements and Business Rules document lists all data elements, including ICH and FDA regional data elements, and validation rules used to process incoming ICSRs. The Business Rules document provides detailed information on the conformance, format, and where applicable, allowed values, nullFavors, and controlled terminologies for each data element.\n\nRegional extensions not described in the FDA E2B(R3) Core and Regional Data Elements and Business Rules document are not allowed.\n\nDescription in English\n\nAll ICSR data elements should be completed in English with the exceptions of the following elements:\n\n\"Reaction/Event as Reported by the Primary Source in Native Language\" (E.i.1.1a);\n\n\"Case Summary and Reporter's Comments in Native Language\" (H.5.r)\n\nDate/Time Data Elements\n\nActual local dates and times should be used and offset (i.e., +/-ZZzz) is attached where appropriate. A single format (CCYYMMDDhhmmss.UUUU[+/-ZZzz]) is used to represent dates and times. The minimum level of precision for the date data elements is specified in theBusiness Rules; however, as much information as is available (e.g., known) should be provided. Future dates are not acceptable in an ICSR message.\n\nUse of Metric Units\n\nMetric units should be used for measurement values.\n\nVersion of Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)\n\nA single version of MedDRA should be used for all MedDRA coding data elements within the same ICSR (i.e., ICSR message). Therefore, the same MedDRA version should be reflected in all the populated data elements concerning MedDRA version information. However, within a safety message (i.e., a batch of ICSRs), different ICSRs can refer to different MedDRA versions.\n\nStandard Terminologies and Codelists\n\nIf a data element is defined with a specific codelist (in the \"Values\" column of the Business Rules), the associated codelist needs to always be used. Also, when the codelist code is captured as the value of a data element, its text name should be provided in display name to make the XML code human readable.\n\nUse of nullFlavors\n\nNullFlavors are used to explain the reason for the lack of data on required elements. The definitions of nullFlavors are from the E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG and can be used as appropriate.\n\nICSR Attachment(s)\n\nIn accordance with E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG, ICSR attachments should be sent inline as embedded files using base 64 encoding (refer to E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG Section 3.5 (Document Attachments) for further information). To facilitate ICSR attachment file processing, the data element \"Attachment file name\" must be included using the (<)reference value(>) data element in the XML file, which must be placed after the (<)text mediaType(>) tag.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n(<)reference typeCode=\"REFR\"(>)\n\n(<)document classCode=\"DOC\" moodCode=\"EVN\"(>)\n\n(<)code code=\"1\" codeSystem=\"2.16.840.1.113883.3.989.2.1.1.27\"\n\ndisplayName=\"documentsHeldBySender\"/(>)\n\n(<)title(>)Narrative Summary Report\n\n(<)text mediaType=\"text/plain\" representation=\"B64\"(>)\n\n(<)reference value=\"Narrative Summary Report.pdf\"/(>)\n\nVGhllIHBhdGllbnQgd2FzIGEgMzUgeWxlIHdpdGggbbm8gc=\n\n(<)/text(>)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(<)/document(>)\n\n(<)/reference(>)\n\nSpecial Note: the \"attachment file name\" must follow the naming convention for a valid \"url\".

You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers who want to use physical-chemical identifiers (PCIDs) in solid oral dosage forms (SODFs). A PCID is a substance or combination of substances possessing a unique physical or chemical property that unequivocally identifies and authenticates a drug product or dosage form.\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to pharmaceutical manufacturers on (1) design considerations for incorporating PCIDS into SODFs, (2) supporting documentation to be submitted in new drug applications (NDAs) and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to address the proposed incorporation of PCIDs in SODFs, (3) supporting documentation to be submitted in postapproval submissions to report or request approval to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs, and (4) procedures for reporting or requesting approval to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs as a postapproval change.\n\nThe incorporation of components or features used in radiofrequency identification for drug products is outside the scope of this guidance. In addition, this guidance does not apply to manufacturing or formulation changes, made in conjunction with the addition of a PCID, that go beyond simply inserting the PCID into a blending or mixing operation (e.g., adding a PCID to a non-functional tablet film coating is covered by this guidance, but adding a non-functional film coating that contains a PCID to a previously uncoated tablet involves manufacturing changes that are not covered by this guidance). The incorporation of a PCID into the packaging or labeling is not covered in this guidance.\n\nOther guidance documents, which may be applicable to proposed changes outside the scope of this guidance, are located on FDA's guidance Web site2 and should be consulted to help todetermine whether additional reporting or approval procedures may apply to proposed changes outside the scope of this guidance.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in an Agency guidance document means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers aiming to thwart drug product counterfeiting have been investigating readily available technologies that may make drug products more difficult to duplicate. One approach that pharmaceutical manufacturers appear to be considering involves adding a trace amount of an inactive ingredient(s) to an existing section3 of the dosage form. A unique physical-chemical characteristic of that ingredient makes it possible to detect and authenticate legitimate dosage forms, and to identify counterfeits.\n\nFootnote 3: Section is the term used for a discrete, contained solid or a layer in a solid oral dosage form. Any section can be described by its composition, the functional characteristics that distinguish it from other sections in that dosage form, and its position relative to other sections that may be present (e.g., coatings, capsule shells, encapsulated particles, a layer in a bi-layer tablet, and compressed powders).\n\nExamples of substances that may be incorporated into SODFs as PCIDs include inks, pigments, flavors, and molecular taggants. Such PCIDs may allow product authentication by their presence alone or may be used to code the product identity into or onto the SODF.\n\nThere are various available means for presentation and detection of PCIDs (e.g., photolithography, holography, optical microscopy, laser scanning devices, excitation/fluorescence detection). Some identifying characteristics, such as pigments or flavors, could be easily observed by patients, healthcare practitioners, and pharmacies. Others could require the use of a detection instrument (e.g., a scanner, photometric detector, mass spectrometry).\n\nFDA anticipates that many of the ingredients that will ultimately be employed as PCIDs are already used as food additives, colorants, or excipients with established safety profiles.\n\n3 Design Considerations for Incorporation of PCIDs in Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nPharmacological and Toxicological Considerations\n\nIf an applicant incorporates a PCID into a solid oral dosage form, we recommend that the ingredients comprising the PCID be pharmacologically inactive so the ingredients can be treated as excipients.\n\nTo minimize toxicological risk, FDA recommends using permissible direct food additives,4 food substances that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) (including direct food substancesaffirmed as GRAS),5 or those ingredients listed in the FDA Inactive Ingredient Guide (IIG) that have been used in SODFs.6\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR parts 182 and 184.\n\nFootnote 6: See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/iig/index.cfm.\n\nCertain substances could present a toxicological risk when used as a PCID in a SODF if the substance is:\n\nUsed at a level in excess of the limitations provided in the relevant IIG listing or Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapter for direct food additives\n\nAn ingredient that has never been used in an SODF or as a direct food additive\n\nAn ingredient that poses risk of adverse reaction (e.g., allergic reaction or irritation), including an ingredient derived from a major food allergen (i.e., milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans)7 Footnote 7: See section 201(qq) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nWe recommend that applicants contact the appropriate clinical review division for more information on how to assess the safety of such proposed PCIDs.\n\n2 Other Design Considerations\n\nA substance employed as a PCID should not adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, potency, or bioavailability of the SODF. To minimize the risk of adverse effects on these characteristics, FDA recommends that applicants add a PCID to an SODF at the lowest level that ensures identification of the dosage unit. Applicants also can minimize the potential for adverse interactions by using a PCID that is relatively inert (i.e., unreactive). Applicants also should consider the potential effect of a PCID on the quality, performance, and stability of the SODF both during the selection of a PCID and during the design of an SODF that will include a PCID.\n\nAnother factor that applicants should consider is the location of the PCID within the drug product. When considering where to place a PCID, the applicant may find it helpful to conceptually subdivide an SODF into sections that differ in composition that may or may not contain active drug substance. For example, a core section in an SODF is likely to contain one or more drug substances,8 while the external sections of the SODF may not. If an applicant places a PCID inside a core section of the SODF, that placement may increase the chances of interactions with the drug substance that could result in degradation. If the applicant is concerned the PCID will interact with core components, incorporating the PCID into an external section of the SODF (e.g., in a coating or an ink-imprinted logo) may reduce the possibility of such interaction.\n\nFootnote 8: The term drug substance is defined in FDA\u2019s regulations at 21 CFR 314.3.\n\nThe applicant should also consider whether the presence of the PCID might interfere with control of the release rate of modified-release SODFs (SODF-MRs), including extended-release and delayed-release dosage forms. Thus, FDA recommends that the applicant consider incorporating the PCID into a section of the SODF-MR that does not contain any release-controlling excipient.9 Since the mechanisms that impart modified-release characteristics are varied, the potential impact on drug product release rate and stability should be evaluated by the applicant prior to incorporating a PCID into an SODF-MR, regardless of the location of the PCID relative to the drug substance and release-controlling excipients.\n\nIV Supporting Documentation to Address the Proposed Incorporation of PCIDs in Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nSection A below describes FDA's recommendations for documentation to be submitted both by applicants proposing to incorporate PCIDs into new SODFs in an NDA or ANDA for initial approval of a drug product and by applicants proposing to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs as a postapproval change. In addition, as described in section B below, FDA recommends that applicants proposing to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs as a postapproval change submit certain additional documentation.\n--------------------\nContext title: Incorporation of Physical-Chemical Identifiers into Solid Oral Dosage Form Drug Products for Anticounterfeiting Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8682270050048828", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.3 Ndc\n\nTo identify each drug for which you are reporting, you will use the 10-digit NDC for the drug as listed with FDA.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA's regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as \"(b)(2)-dietary ingredients.\" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA's regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as \"the compliance requirements.\"\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA's Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.0765643119812012", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: GUIDANCE DOCUMENT\n\nGuidance for Industry: Exemptions from the Warning Label Requirement for Juice\n\nOCTOBER 2002\n\nFinal\n\nDocket Number: FDA-2001-D-0138 (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2001-D-0138).

Burnham,\n\n(240-402-2030). This guidance represents the agency's current thinking on reducing microbial food safety hazards in juice. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance document supercedes \"Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,\" September 18, 1998.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the Federal Register of July 8, 1998 (63 FR 37030), the Food and Drug Administration\n\n(FDA) published a final rule requiring a warning label on any juice that has not been\n\nprocessed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms that may be present\n\n(the \"juice labeling rule\"). In this guidance document, juice means any juice or juice\n\ningredient in a beverage, as defined by 21 CFR 120.1(a). Under 21 CFR 101.17(g), any juice or\n\njuice ingredient that is not processed to reduce pathogens by 100,000-fold (i.e., attain a 5-log\n\nreduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism) must bear a warning label. Becauselabeling may have limited effectiveness (i.e., it must be read and be understood), the warning label was intended to provide a measure of public safety until final Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations for juice could be established and implemented.\n\nIn the Federal Register of January 19, 2001 (66 FR 6138), FDA published a final rule requiring the application of HACCP principles to the processing of any juice or juice ingredient in a beverage (the \"juice HACCP rule\"). Juice produced in a retail establishment, i.e., a facility that produces juice that is only sold directly to consumers, is exempt from the HACCP requirements. Like the juice labeling rule, the juice HACCP rule utilizes the standard of a 5-log reduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism. Specifically, under $120.24(a), juice processors must establish control measures that will produce such a reduction.\n\nAfter the publication of the juice labeling rule, FDA's scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction evolved, as discussed in the preamble and as reflected in the requirements of the juice HACCP rule.\n\nPurpose of this Guidance\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide guidance to those juice processors not yet subject to the juice HACCP rule (e.g., small and very small processors who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule until January 21, 2003 and January 20, 2004, respectively) who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. This guidance document also provides guidance to processors at retail who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule and who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. FDA encourages those processors to operate consistently with this guidance in terms of 5-log pathogen reduction treatments because this guidance is based upon FDA's current scientific knowledge. In part, this guidance supercedes the previous 5-log pathogen reduction guidance in the juice labeling rule and FDA's guidance document, \"Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide\" (the \"small entity compliance guide\") (Ref. 1), because these documents no longer reflect FDA's current thinking.\n\nFDA Recommendations\n\nFDA's current scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction is based on information obtained from public meetings, discussions, comments to the juice HACCP proposed rule (63 FR 20450), and recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF) (Refs. 2 and 3). To assist juice processors in attaining a 5-log pathogen reduction consistent with current scientific knowledge, Table 1 compares FDA's previous and current recommendations for achieving the 5-log pathogen reduction. The following questions and answers provide additional guidance in terms of FDA's current recommendations for the 5-log reduction:Question: When in the process should the 5-log pathogen reduction treatment be applied? Answer: Based upon current scientific understanding, FDA recommends that the 5-log pathogen reduction and final product packaging occur under one firm's control, in a single production facility that is operating under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) and immediately before or immediately after packing. This recommendation is for both citrus and non-citrus juices. Although good agricultural practices (GAPs) and CGMPs at the farming and harvesting stages are encouraged, they should not be counted towards the 5-log pathogen reduction. The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6166). Question: What should be treated? Answer: FDA recommends that juice processors use treatments that directly contact all pathogens that may be present in or on the fruit or vegetables being processed. For most products, this means that the treatments should be performed on the juice after it is expressed. For citrus juices only, effective surface treatment of the citrus fruit may constitute direct contact with all pathogens, and thus, processors may consider counting such treatment toward the 5-log pathogen reduction. If surface treatments are used on citrus fruits to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction, FDA recommends that the treatment be applied to undamaged, tree-picked fruit (i.e., culled fruit that is U.S. Department of Agriculture choice or higher quality), that has been cleaned. (Note: There is no current USDA standard for choice or higher quality. FDA will consider undamaged tree-picked citrus fruit to meet the definition of \"culled\" for purposes of compliance with the juice HACCP regulation). The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6171).\n\nSummary\n\nSmall and very small processors (as defined in 21 CFR 120.1(b)) who do not treat their juice to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction should continue to comply with the juice labeling rule. All other juice processors are now required by the juice HACCP regulation (21 CFR Part 120) to apply HACCP principles to their processing operations and to have, in any resulting HACCP plan, measures to achieve a 5-log reduction in pathogens. Based upon FDA's current knowledge, processing juice in accordance with the recommendations in the small entity compliance guide for the juice labeling rule may not reduce pathogens to an acceptable level. Therefore, juice processors claiming exemption from the warning label requirement on the basis of the 5-log pathogen reduction provision of 21 CFR 101.17(g)(7) should consider the principles in this guidance. On August 31, 2001, FDA published a guidance document, \"The Juice HACCP Regulation: Questions and Answers\" to provide additional information on the juice HACCP rule, including assistance in achieving a 5-log pathogen reduction. As a follow-up to that document, FDA plans to publish additional information in question and answer format that processors may find useful, as well as additional guidance documents including, \"Guidancefor Industry: Juice HACCP Hazards and Control Guide\" and \"Guidance on Bulk Transport of Juice Concentrates and Certain Shelf Stable Juices.\" All documents will be available electronically.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] FDA, DHHS, \"Guidance for Industry: Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,\" September 18, 1998.\n\n[2] FSIS, USDA, \"National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi2\n\n[3] dhname=1999 register&docid=99-30222-filed),\" 64 FR 63281-63282, November 19, 1999.\n\n[4] NACMCF, \"National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food, Meeting on Fresh Citrus Juice; Transcript of Proceedings,\" December 8 to 9, 1999, public meeting.\n\nThe above guidance document supercedes the previous version dated December 21, 2001.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Exemptions from the Warning Label Requirement for Juice \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.2866222858428955", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.479361057281494", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Ingredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice: Guidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling\n\nFood Labeling and Standards Staff, HFS-820\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-2371\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

Each class or subclass of food is to be given a common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods. The common or usual name, which may be a coined term, must accurately describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients; must be uniform among all identical or similar products; and may not be \"confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name\" (21 CFR 102.5(a)).\n\nSugar cane products exist in many different forms, ranging from raw sugars and syrups to refined sugar and molasses. These products are differentiated by their moisture, molasses, and sucrose content as well as by crystal size and any special treatments (e.g., treatment with sulfur).2 Sugar cane products with common or usual names established by regulation are sugar (21 CFR 101.4(b)(20)) and cane sirup (alternatively spelled \"syrup\") (21 CFR 168.130). Several other sugar cane products have common or usual names established by common usage (e.g., molasses, brown sugar, turbinado sugar, muscovado sugar, and demerara sugar). For purposes of ingredient labeling, \"sugar\" is defined to mean sucrose obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1854, the regulation affirming that sucrose is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food when used under specified conditions. The GRAS regulation describes sucrose as the substance \"obtained by crystallization from sugar cane or sugar beet juice that has been extracted by pressing or diffusion, then clarified and evaporated\" (21 CFR 184.1854(a)). To be GRAS for use in food, sucrose must be of a purity suitable for its intended use (21 CFR 184.1854(b)).\n\nFootnote 2: Honig, P. Principles of Sugar Technology. Elsevier Publishing Company. 1953.\n\nOn October 7, 2009, FDA published a draft guidance entitled \"Guidance for Industry:\n\nIngredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice\" in the Federal Register (74 FR 51610) to advise industry of FDA's view that the common or usual name for the solid or dried form of sugar cane syrup is \"dried cane syrup,\" and that sweeteners derived from sugar cane syrup should not be declared on food labels as \"evaporated cane juice\" because that term falsely suggests the sweeteners are juice. On March 5, 2014, we reopened the comment period (79 FR 12507) for the draft guidance seeking further comments, data, and information about how the ingredient sometimes declared as \"evaporated cane juice\" is produced, what its basic nature and characterizing properties are, and how it compares with other sweeteners made from sugar cane. We received numerous comments on the draft guidance. The majority of comments objected to the term \"dried cane syrup.\" Several comments from sugar producers asserted that this term does not accurately describe the ingredient they produce, mostly because the standardized food \"cane syrup\" is not the starting material or an intermediate step for the ingredient they refer to as \"evaporated cane juice.\" Based on comments stating that the ingredient sometimes declared as evaporated cane juice is not made from cane syrup as defined in 21 CFR 168.130, FDA is no longer recommending that this ingredient be labeled as \"dried cane syrup.\"\n\nMany comments described the process used to manufacture the ingredient described as \"evaporated cane juice,\" and some comments also described the manufacturing process for other products derived from sugar cane. The initial processing steps are generally the same for all products produced from sugar cane. After sugar cane is harvested, it is cut or shredded and then crushed to extract the fluid. The extracted fluid is clarified and then evaporated to concentrate the solids. To make the product \"evaporated cane juice,\" the concentrated cane extract is filtered and undergoes a single crystallization process. The crystals are then separated from the molasses using centrifugation. From the comments, the method of filtering the \"evaporated cane juice\"\n\nfluid varies from producer to producer, as does the method used for single crystallization.\n\nMost other common types of cane sugar (e.g., white sugar, brown sugar) are not filtered prior to the first crystallization. After the crystals are separated from the molasses using centrifugation, as part of the refining process, the sugar is melted and re-crystallized. Most cane-based sweeteners, including white sugar, undergo multiple crystallization steps.\n\nSome comments stated that \"evaporated cane juice\" has essentially the same composition as white sugar and other sweeteners derived from sugar cane. As support for this point, one comment provided a specification sheet for \"evaporated cane juice\" indicating that the ingredient contains between 99.0 and 99.8% sucrose. The comment also included a specification sheet for another product identified as \"certified organic sugar\" and pointed out that the composition of the two products was identical except that the organic ingredient was made with organic sugar cane. Other comments focused on the differences between \"evaporated cane juice\" and other cane-based sweeteners. For example, some of these comments stated that \"evaporated cane juice\" has a different composition from white sugar because it retains traces of molasses and minerals. A few comments said that \"evaporated cane juice\" is different than other less refined, \"alternative\" sugars because it contains less molasses and can be substituted for white sugar in processed foods without affecting the taste or appearance of the finished product.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nThis guidance is intended to help consumers make informed choices among sweeteners by promoting accurate and consistent labeling. To that end, we are advising the regulated industry of our view that the term \"evaporated cane juice\" is not the common or usual name of any type of sweetener and that this ingredient should instead be declared on food labels as \"sugar,\" preceded by one or more truthful, non-misleading descriptors if the manufacturer so chooses (e.g., \"cane sugar\").\n\nIn developing this guidance, FDA reviewed the Codex Alimentarius Commission's (Codex's) Standard for Sugars, Codex Stan. 212-1999 (Ref. 4), which provides standards for certain sugars intended for human consumption without further processing, to determine whether Codex had established a standard for a product similar to that described on some U.S. food labels as \"evaporated cane juice.\" The Codex Standard for Sugars contains no product identified as \"evaporated cane juice.\" However, the Codex standard does define \"raw cane sugar\"3 as \"[p]artially purified sucrose, which is crystallised from partially purified cane juice, without further purification, but which does not preclude centrifugation or drying, and which is characterised by sucrose crystals covered with a film of cane molasses.\" This standard appears to describe the same sweetener referred to in many of the comments as \"evaporated cane juice.\" We agree that the common or usual name used to describe this ingredient on food labels should include the term \"sugar\" because that term describes the basic nature and characterizing properties of the food.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Ingredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.5911216735839844", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Manual\n\nGuidance for Industry: Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling\n\nMARCH 1998\n\nDocket Number:\n\nFDA-2020-0-1961 (http://www.nequidations.gov/docket/FDA-2020-0-1961)\n\nIssued by:\n\n(In regulatory:information/search:fta-guidance-documents/guidance-industry:guide-developing-and-using-data-bases-nutrition-labeling)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nMore Food Labeling and Nutrition Guidance Documents (/labeling-nutrition)\n\nFor updated examples of nutrition labels see Examples of Revised Nutrition Facts Panel Listing Trans Fat (http://wyback.archive-it.org/2093/20170110105214/http://www.fta.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/labelingNutrition/ucm?\n\n(http://www.fta.gov/about-fta/website-policies/website-disclaimer).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nForeword: Purpose of the Manual\n\nThe Nutrition Label\n\nChapter I: Introduction and Background\n\nWhat Are Nutrition Labeling Data Bases?\n\nManufacturer's Responsibility\n\nSubmitting Data Bases to FDA is Voluntary.\n\nHow Compliance Works - Title a of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 101.0(g))\n\nWhy_Submit a Data Base to FDA?\n\nChapter II: How to Develop a Nutrition Labeling Data Base\n\n1.

It has been written by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to assist industry in the task of preparing nutrient information for labels (see sample below) and labeling that meets the requirements of FDA regulations. This manual gives generic instructions for developing and preparing an acceptable data base, as well as the recommended statistical methodology to develop nutrition label values. A manufacturer, trade association, or other data base developer may follow the guidelines presented here or may choose to use alternative procedures not provided in this document. FDA recommends that those choosing to use alternative procedures discuss the procedures further with the agency to prevent expenditure of resources and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable to FDA._FDA is committed to working with all interested parties to achieve reliable nutrition labeling data in the most economical fashion. The agency acknowledges that following all of the recommendations/guidance in this manual could pose an economic hardship. Therefore, in certain instances, FDA may accept a proposal to develop a data base over several years to help defer costs. This manual also includes FDA's policy statement regarding its data base review process. The agency has modified its review process in response to concerns expressed by industry.\n\nThe Nutrition Label\n\nNutritional information is based on product as packaged 101.9(b)(9)\n\nChapter I: Introduction and Background\n\nOver 25 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated regulatory activities directed toward the development of regulations for nutrition labeling of food products. In 1973, FDA published the first regulations that required the nutrition labeling of certain foods: those with added nutrients and those for which a nutrition claim was made on the label, or in labeling or advertising. However, it wasn't until the 1990's that regulations promulgated under the authority of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) expanded mandatory nutrition labeling to virtually all foods regulated by FDA. In response to these regulations, industry has expressed greater interest in creating nutrition labeling data bases.\n\nWhat Are Nutrition Labeling Data Bases?\n\nNutrition labeling data bases are generally collections of nutrient data for specific products or commodities, which are compiled by a manufacturer, organization, or trade association representing a group of manufacturers. The majority of the nutrition labeling data bases that industry has submitted to FDA for review fall into the \"finished food\" category. The submitted data are supported and accompanied by documentation that describes the sampling strategies, analytical methodology, and statistical treatment of data.\n\nAnother type of nutrition labeling data base is an ingredient or \"recipe\" data base that is comprised of nutrient data from several sources. For such data bases, software is used to calculate label values derived from the nutrient content of ingredients that comprise a product's recipe, while taking into account nutrient losses during processing.\n\nNutrition labeling data bases are proprietary. They are owned by the developer and are seldom publicly available. Proprietary nutrition labeling data bases developed by industry and submitted to FDA for review should not be confused with data available from the scientific literature or commercially available software.\n\nManufacturer's Responsibility\n\nFDA's continuing policy since the 1970s assigns the manufacturer the responsibility for assuring the validity of a product label's stated nutrient values. Accordingly, the source of the data used to calculate nutrition label values is the prerogative of the manufacturer, but FDA's policy recommends that the nutrient values for labeling be based on product composition, as determined by laboratory analysis of each nutrient. FDA continues to recommend the use of the Official Methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists International (AOAC), with non-AOAC Official Methods used only in the absence of appropriate AOAC validated methods. For each product that is included in a nutrition labeling data base submitted to FDA, the agency requests that the developer include a table identifying proposed analytical methods that were used in the analysis of each nutrient, with accompanying information containing validation of the method used by the onsite or commercial laboratory for the matrix of interest.\n\n5.1 Submitting Data Bases to FDA is Voluntary\n\nAlthough FDA encourages industry to submit nutrition labeling data bases to the agency for review, submission of a data base to FDA for the purpose of nutrition labeling is voluntary. The agency has not and does not intend to prescribe how an individual company is to determine nutrient content for labeling purposes.\n\nHow Compliance Works -- Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 101.9(g))\n\nFDA analyzes food samples that have been randomly collected from lots to determine compliance with labeling regulations. The agency defines a food lot as a collection of the same size, type and style of the food that is designated by a common container code or marking, or that constitutes a day's production. The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of 1z subsamples (consumer units), taken 1 from each of 1z randomly chosen shipping cases. FDA will then analyze the nutrient content of this 1 composite test sample.\n\nThe agency generally analyzes composites by appropriate methods found in the most recent edition of Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International (AOAC International, Gaithersburg, MD, 16th edition, 1995, and yearly revisions/updates) (see below for additional information on selection of methods). The ratio between the nutrient level derived by analytical testing and the label value is calculated to determine whether the nutrient in question is in compliance with applicable regulations. The ratio is defined as:\n\n(laboratory value / label value) x 100 = %\n\nIn order to evaluate the accuracy of nutrition label information against a standard for compliance purposes, FDA regulations define two nutrient classes (Class I and Class II) (2i CFR 101.9(g)(3)) and list a third group (Third Group) of nutrients (2i CFR 101.9(g)(5)). Class I nutrients are those added in fortified or fabricated foods. These nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. Class I nutrients must be present at 100% or more of the value declared on the label ; in other words, the nutrient content identified by the laboratory analysis must be at least equal to the label value. For example, if vitamin C is added in a fortified product and the label states that vitamin C is present at 10% Daily Value (DV), the laboratory value must equal at least 6 mg of vitamin C/serving (i.e., 10% of the 60 mg Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C that is specified in 2i CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The ratio between a laboratory finding of 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving (i.e., 8% DV) and the label value of 10% DV would be calculated as follows:\n\n(8% / 10%) x 100 = 80% or (4.8 mg / 6 mg) x 100 = 80%\n\nand the label value would not be in compliance.\n\nClass II nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat, or potassium that occur naturally in a food product. Class II nutrients must be present at 80% or more of the value declared on the label. As an example: If vitamin C is a naturally occurring nutrient in a product, and the product declares 10% DV vitamin C (i.e., 6 mg/serving) on its label, then laboratory analysis must find at least 80% of the label value (80% of 6 mg or 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving) for the product to be in compliance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.567653656005859", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: 33742 at 33795.\n\nIn summary, we considered whether a physiological effect-based definition was appropriate for total carbohydrates and determined that it was not because of the wide variety of effects of different types of carbohydrates.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed in the final rule, the information in the Nutrition Facts label is not targeted to individuals with acute or chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease). The nutrient declaration and percent Daily Values on the label are to help consumers make more informed choices to consume a healthy diet and not intended for the clinical management of an existing disease (81 FR 33742 at 33750). Inclusion of allulose in the declaration of \"Total Carbohydrate\" on Nutrition and Supplement Facts label is also consistent with how we have considered the declaration of other substances that are captured under the method that is currently used for the determination of \"Total Carbohydrate\" on the label, including those that provide few or no calories, such as sugar alcohols and dietary fibers.\n\nTherefore, because allulose is a carbohydrate, it is captured under the calculation method for \"Total Carbohydrate\" described in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6), like a number of other substances without significant caloric contribution. We have determined that our existing definition of carbohydrate is the most appropriate and allulose must be included in the amount of \"Total Carbohydrate\" declared on the label under the existing regulations.\n\n3 FDA's Consideration of Allulose as a Sugar\n\nTotal Sugars are defined in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii) as the sum of all free mono-and disaccharides (such as glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose). Allulose is a monosaccharide that is an epimer of D-fructose. In the final rule, we said that consumption of sugars continues to be associated with an increased risk of dental caries; thus, the \"Total Sugars\" declaration continues to be necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices (81 FR 33742 at 33798).\n\nThe 2015 Tate & Lyle citizen petition (Ref. 1) suggested that allulose should not be included in the \"Total Sugars\" declaration because it is not metabolized like a sugar, does not raise blood glucose levels, and inclusion in the \"Total Sugars\" declaration would be confusing to consumers, particularly those who monitor their blood glucose levels. A summary of the evidence related to the cariogenic potential, metabolism, and caloric value of, and glycemic response to, allulose is provided in a memorandum to the file (Ref. 8).\n\nWe have traditionally determined what is captured under the \"Total Sugars\" declaration on the label by chemical structure. Due to advances in food technology, novel sugars are now available that are not metabolized and that do not contribute 4 kcal/g to the diet like other traditional sugars. Consequently, we need to consider how information about sugars like allulose should be captured on the label.\n\nOur current thinking is that, consistent with the goal of section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the nutrient declarations to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, we should consider not only the chemical structure of sugars, but also other evidence, including their association with dental caries and how they are metabolized in the body (e.g., caloric contribution and their effect on blood glucose and insulin levels), when determining whether a sugar should be included in the declaration of \"Total Sugars\" on the label.\n\nSugars are known to be associated with an increased risk of dental caries (21 CFR 101.80). Sugars that are metabolized by oral bacteria produce polymers that adhere to the tooth surface (i.e., dental plaque) and generate acids resulting in a decrease in the pH (Ref. 9) of dental plaque. The low pH provides an environment that allows for decalcification of the teeth (e.g., solubilization of calcium from dental enamel), increasing the risk of dental caries (or tooth decay) (Ref. 10). The \"Total Sugars\" declaration provides consumers with information that they can use to evaluate the contribution of sugars in their diet to the risk of dental caries. We therefore believe that evidence related to the association between consumption of a sugar and dental caries is an important consideration when determining whether the amount of a particular sugar in a serving of a product should be excluded from the \"Total Sugars\" declaration on the label.\n\nMono and disaccharides typically provide 4 kcal/g (Ref. 2). If a consumer wishes to determine how many calories are contributed by sugars in their diet, they can multiply the grams of Total Sugars per serving by 4 kcal/g. Current dietary recommendations suggest that Americans should limit their consumption of calories from sugars, and particularly added sugars, and stay within calorie limits (Ref. 11). As a result, manufacturers are substituting sugars that provide much less than 4 kcal/g, such as allulose, for sugars that provide 4 kcal/g in an effort to reduce caloric content. Including sugars that contribute much less than 4 kcal/g to the diet in the \"Total Sugars\" declaration would not accurately reflect the caloric contribution to the diet of sugars like allulose that contain much less than 4 kcal/g. Therefore, we consider the caloric contribution of a sugar to be an important consideration when determining if the sugar should be excluded from the amount of the \"Total Sugars\" declaration.\n\nDuring digestion, disaccharides are hydrolyzed into two monosaccharide units in the upper small intestine. Primarily, the body breaks sugars down into glucose, which is used as energy by cells in the body or stored as glycogen (Ref. 12). Consuming sugar increases circulating glucose in the blood stream. The presence of glucose in the blood triggers the release of the hormone insulin from the pancreas. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, when traditional sugars like glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose are consumed, there is a rise in blood glucose and insulin levels (Ref. 12). The \"Total Sugars\" declaration provides consumers with information that they can use to determine whether a product contains sugars that are likely to cause an increase in circulating blood glucose and insulin levels. Some consumers expect that when they eat sugars, the result will be an increase in blood glucose and insulin levels. Therefore, we consider a sugar's effect on blood glucose and insulin levels to be important considerations when determining whether a sugar should be excluded from the \"Total Sugars\" declaration.\n\nAllulose, like other non-cariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners listed in 21 CFR 101.80(c)(2)(ii), does not result in a decrease in dental plaque pH below 5.7, which is associated with decalcification of the dental enamel (Ref. 10). Therefore, given the low variogenic potential of allulose, we conclude that allulose does not promote dental caries. Furthermore, based on our review of the evidence, we conclude that allulose, once ingested, is rapidly absorbed (within 1 hour) and cleared from plasma in 24 hours, and 70% of orally consumed allulose is eliminatedintact in urine and feces within 48 hours (Ref. [8]).7 Allulose produces only a negligible increase in glycemic and insulinemic responses and is not readily fermented in the large intestine, providing no more than 0.4 kcal/g (Ref. [8]). Based on the totality of the available evidence from which scientific conclusions can be drawn, allulose does not promote dental caries and is virtually unmetabolized in the human body (Ref. [8]).\n\nFootnote 7: In this mass-balance study, 70.4% of the ({}^{14})C radiotracer orally administered to seven subjects was eliminated as intact allulose in urine and feces, while 1.5 % was identified as glucose and fructose, 11.7% were not identified (unknown), and the remaining radioactivity was lost during the process (Ref. [8]).\n\nAs previously discussed, allulose does not result in a decrease in the dental plaque pH below 5.7, at which decalcification of dental enamel may begin, and thus, does not promote dental caries. It provides much less than 4 kcal/g. Additionally, the consumption of allulose produces only a negligible increase in glycemic and insulinemic responses. Therefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the exclusion of allulose from the amount of \"Total Sugars\" declared on the label pending future rulemaking regarding amending the definition of \"Total Sugars.\"\n\nFinally, we note that allulose must be declared in the ingredient statement in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4 if it is present in a product so that consumers can determine when it is an ingredient in a food.\n\n4 FDA's Consideration of Allulose as an Added Sugar\n\nAdded sugars are sugars that are either added during the processing of foods, or are packaged as such, and include sugars (free, mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type.\n\nAs previously discussed, we did not decide whether allulose should be excluded from the amount of \"Added Sugars\" declared on the label in the final rule and stated that allulose must be included in the declaration of \"Added Sugars\" pending any future rulemaking regarding excluding allulose from the declaration.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.8557233810424805"], "Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Interpretation of the \"Deed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nDecember 2018\n\nProceduralInterpretation of the \"Deed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{th}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: occod@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guida\n\nnces/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nDecember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInterpretation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the\n\nBiologicals Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for\n\nBiologicals Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or\n\nAgency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA\n\nor the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the\n\napplicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff\n\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's interpretation of the provision of the Biologic's Price Competition\n\nand Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) under which an application for a biological product\n\napproved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21\n\nU.S.C. 355) as of March 23, 2020, will be deemed to be a license for the biological product\n\nunder section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262) on March 23, 2020. Specifically, this guidance describes FDA's interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\"\n\nprovision in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act for biological products that are approved under\n\nsection 505 of the FD&C Act as of March 23, 2020 (the transition date). This guidance also\n\nprovides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in\n\nan application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or\n\nbefore March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nAlthough the majority of therapeutic biological products have been licensed under section 351 of\n\nthe PHS Act, some protein products historically have been approved under section 505 of the\n\nFD&C Act (see the Appendix to this guidance for examples of such products). On March 23,\n\n2010, the BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n(Public Law 111-148). The BPCI Act clarified the statutory authority under which certain\n\nprotein products will be regulated by amending the definition of a \"biological product\"2 in\n\nsection 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a \"protein (except any chemically synthesizedpolypeptide),\"3 and describing procedures for submission of a marketing application for certain biological products.\n\nFootnote 3: FDA has described its interpretation of the statutory terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cchemically synthesized polypeptide\u201d in the amended definition of \u201cbiological product\u201d in guidance. See draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic. FDA\u2019s guidances for industry are available on the FDA Drugs guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs web guidance page. In addition, in the Federal Register of December 12, 2018, FDA also has issued a proposed rule to amend its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cchemically synthesized polypeptide.\u201d When final, this regulation will codify FDA\u2019s interpretation of these terms.\n\nThe BPCI Act requires that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act; this requirement is subject to certain exceptions during a 10-year transition period ending on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(1)-(3) and (e)(5) of the BPCI Act and section II of this guidance). On March 23, 2020 (i.e., the transition date), an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (see section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act). This guidance sets forth FDA's current interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the \"Hatch-Waxman Amendments\"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system such as a microorganism, or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines \"biosimilarity\" to mean that \"the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for \"interchangeability,\" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nThe BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.590873718261719", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: The term applicant means the owner, holder, or sponsor of a new drug application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA).\n\nContents\n\nThe term application includes both NDAs and BLAs.\n\nThe term drug includes drug and biologic products.\n\nThe term final dosage form means, with respect to a prescription drug product, a finished dosage form which is approved for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.5 Substantial further manufacturing does not include packaging.6 FDA generally considers a product to be in final dosage form unless one or more of the following operations is required but has yet to be performed: mixing, granulating, milling, molding, lyophilizing, tableting, encapsulating, coating, sterilizing, and filling sterile, aerosol, or gaseous drugs into dispensing containers.\n\nThe term human drug application means an application for (1) approval of a new drug submitted under section 505(b) of the Act or (2) license of a biological drug product under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).7 For purposes of this guidance, the term human drug application does not include the following:\n\nFootnote 5: Section 735(4) of the Act.\n\nFootnote 6: See section 735(5) of the Act.\n\nFootnote 7: Section 735(1) of the Act.\n\nA supplement to such an application\n\nAn application with respect to whole blood or a blood component for transfusion\n\nAn application with respect to a bovine blood product for topical application licensed before September 1, 1992\n\nAn application for an allergenic extract product\n\nAn application for a device licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act\n\nAn application with respect to a large volume parenteral drug product approved before September 1, 1992\n\nAn application for a license of a biological product for further manufacturing use only\n\nAn application submitted by a State or Federal Government entity for a drug that is not distributed commercially8 Footnote 8: Id.\n\nThe term person means the person subject to fees and includes any affiliates of that person.9 The term person includes an individual, partnership, corporation, and association.10 This document will also use the term person when referring to an applicant.

Each is addressed in a separate waiver guidance. Specifically, for companies participating in the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, see the guidance document, User Fee Waivers for FDC and Co-Packaged HIV Drugs for PEPFAR.

Fees-exceed-the-costs waivers and reductions are not addressed in this guidance document.13\n\nFootnote 13: There is a separate guidance document that discusses the Agency\u2019s current thinking on the fees-exceed-the-costs waiver provision. For more information, see the guidance document, Fees-Exceed-the-Costs Waivers Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and its addendum at the guidance Web page.\n\nAppendix A Public Health\n\nUnder section 736(d)(1)(A) of the Act, an applicant may qualify for a waiver of or reduction in application, product, and/or establishment fees if the waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the public health. Under this provision, FDA may grant a public health waiver of or reduction in user fees if the Agency finds that the following two criteria are met:\n\nThe product protects the public health; and\n\nThe applicant shows that a waiver or reduction is necessary to continue an activity that protects the public health.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTo qualify for a waiver or reduction in user fees under this provision, an applicant must meet both criteria.\n\n2.2.2 Does the product protect the public health?\n\nFor user fee purposes, a product that has been approved for marketing in the United States is not automatically deemed to be a product that protects the public health. In evaluating whether a product protects the public health, the Agency asks the following questions:\n\nIs the drug product a significant improvement (or does it have the potential to be a significant improvement if the drug product is not yet approved) compared to other marketed products, including other dosage forms or routes of administration and non-drug products or therapies?\n\nAre there treatment alternatives? The existence of alternatives would weigh against a determination that a product is necessary to protect the public health.\n\nIs the drug product designated as a priority drug,14 has it been granted fast track status,15 or has it been determined to be a new molecular entity? Affirmative answers to these questions usually indicate that a product protects the public health. Other questions the Agency may consider include:\n\nFootnote 14: Further information regarding priority drugs can be found in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research\u2019s (CDER\u2019s) Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) 6020.3R, Review Classification Policy: Priority (P) and Standard (S). MAPP 6020.3R is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov, search by MAPP number.\n\nFootnote 15: Further information regarding fast track status can be found in CDER\u2019s guidance for industry on Fast Track Development Programs \u2014 Designation, Development, and Application Review.\n\nDoes the drug product demonstrate an increased effectiveness in the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of disease?\n\nDoes it eliminate or substantially reduce a treatment-limiting drug reaction?\n\nDoes the drug product enhance patient adherence to treatment?\n\nHas the drug product shown potential evidence of safety and effectiveness for a new or underserved subpopulation (e.g., treatment for a drug resistant microbe or response to a homeland security concern)?\n\nIs the drug product intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition?\n\nDoes the drug product address unmet medical needs or demonstrate the potential to do so?\n\nIs the product designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition under section 526 of the Act (i.e., does it have an orphan designation)?Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the product is approved, is it available to the public? There is no benefit to the public health if a product is not made available to the public.16 Footnote 16: We would consider products stockpiled for homeland security concerns as available to the public for user fee waiver purposes.\n\nIs the waiver or reduction necessary to continue an activity that protects the public health?\n\nTo determine whether a waiver of or reduction in user fees is necessary to continue an activity that protects the public health, the Agency considers not only the benefit to the public health, but also whether the waiver or reduction is necessary. The legislative history of PDUFA I states that FDA may waive or reduce fees unless such a waiver or reduction is not necessary to protect the public health, or it is apparent that the fee will not be a disincentive to innovation.17 It also expressly notes that FDA should consider the \"limited resources\" of the applicant when evaluating a request for a fee waiver or reduction under section 736(d).18 Therefore, the Agency believes that a financial test is appropriate for the public health waiver provision. The Agency considers the relationship between the annualized cost of user fees and the financial resources of the applicant, including affiliates, requesting the waiver or reduction. The financial considerations are discussed in section IV.C below.\n\nFootnote 17: House Report 102-895 (1992) at 17.\n\nBarrier to Innovation\n\nUnder section 736(d)(1)(B) of the Act, an applicant may qualify for a waiver of or reduction in application, product, and/or establishment fees when the assessment of the fees would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to the applicant or other circumstances. Under this provision, FDA may grant a waiver of or reduction in user fees if:\n\nThe product or other products or technologies under development by the applicant are innovative; and\n\nThe fee(s) would be a significant barrier to the applicant's ability to develop, manufacture, or market innovative products or to pursue innovative technology.\n\nTo qualify for a waiver or reduction in user fees under this provision, an applicant must meet both criteria.\n--------------------\nContext title: User Fee Waivers, Reductions, and Refunds for Drug and Biological Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.6843409538269043", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Accordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020.

For example, a pending \"stand-alone\" efficacy supplement to a \"stand-alone\" NDA16 (e.g., a supplement intended to address a post-approval requirement or post-approval commitment) will be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date and reviewed under applicable standards for 351(a) BLAs. Similarly, a pending CBE supplement to an application submitted under the FD&C Act will be administratively converted to a pending CBE supplement to the deemed BLA on the transition date, irrespective of whether the change described in the CBE supplement has been implemented before or after the transition date. The Agency also intends to maintain the same goal date, where applicable, for completion of its review of such supplements.\n\nFootnote 15: See generally 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nFootnote 16: See section III.B.1 of this guidance for information on \u201cstand-alone\u201d NDAs. There may be additional considerations for a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA and a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application.\n\nii.2.2 Removal of Biological Products from the Orange Book on March 23, 2020\n\nFDA intends to remove biological products that have been approved in NDAs from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book)17 on March 23, 2020, based on the Agency's position that these products are no longer \"listed drugs\" and such NDAs may not be relied upon by a 505(b)(2) applicant (or ANDA applicant) for approval. After March 23, 2020, FDA will not approve any NDA (or ANDA), including those that are pending or tentatively approved, for a biological product.\n\nFootnote 17: Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be listed in FDA\u2019s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity, the exclusivity provisions of the FD&C Act serve to limit the submission or approval of applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act, but not under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that no applications for biological products may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act after the transition date. Accordingly, on March 23, 2020, any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act (e.g., 5-year exclusivity or 3-year exclusivity) would\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\ndeemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. Reference product exclusivity recognizes the fact that the sponsor of an eligible reference product generated (and submitted for review) the data and information required to obtain a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and limits competition from biosimilar and interchangeable products for a limited period of time. The biological products that will be deemed to have BLAs on the transition date, however, have already obtained marketing approval under a different statutory authority. Allowing such products to obtain a separate 12-year period of reference product exclusivity would inappropriately impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition in several product classes.\n\nRecognizing these principles, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act together with section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act such that section 351(k)(7)(A)-(B) of the PHS Act applies only to products that have undergone review and licensing under section 351(a), and not to biological products that will be deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date. At the same time, FDA interprets the limitations on eligibility for reference product exclusivity in section 351(k)(7)(C) of the PHS Act to apply to any \"reference product,\" without regard to whether such product was \"first licensed under subsection (a)\" or instead deemed to be a license under section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act. Nothing in the BPCI Act suggests that Congress intended holders of deemed BLAs to be able to circumvent the statutory limitations on eligibility for a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity through subsequent submissions simply because the previous reference product was deemed to be licensed under section 7002(e). Therefore, FDA interprets section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act together with section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act such that section 351(k)(7)(C) will operate to bar supplements to deemed BLAs and, where applicable, subsequent BLAs from being eligible for their own periods of reference product exclusivity.\n\nRecommendations for Sponsors of Proposed Protein Products Intended for Submission in an Application Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act\n\nSponsors of development programs for proposed protein products should evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. FDA's recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a \"stand-alone\" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 \"Stand-Alone\" New Drug Applications\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6605826020240784", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Applicant: Any person or legal entity that has submitted an application to manufacture a product subject to licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262).

FDA's recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a \"stand-alone\" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 \"Stand-Alone\" New Drug Applications\n\nAn application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (i.e., a \"stand-alone\" NDA) contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness that were conducted by or for the applicant or for which the applicant has a right of reference or use. Sponsors of a proposed protein product intended for submission in an NDA under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. A 351(a) BLA for a biological product can be submitted before, on, or after March 23, 2020. Sponsors can contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER with any questions about a BLA submission.19\n\nFootnote 19: FDA has taken measures to minimize differences in the review and approval of products required to have approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act and products required to have approved NDAs under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (see section 123(f) of FDAMA). However, certain differences continue to exist. For additional information on how FDA intends to address these issues, see the Transition Q&A Draft Guidance or contact the relevant review division. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n2.2.2 505(b)(2) Applications\n\nA 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature). A 505(b)(2) application that seeks to rely on a listed drug must contain adequate data and information to demonstrate that the proposed product is sufficiently similar to the listed drug to justify reliance, in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the listed drug. Any aspects of the proposed product that differ from the listed drug must be supported by adequate data and information to support the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product.\n\nCongress did not provide an approval pathway under the PHS Act that directly corresponds to section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Accordingly, there are additional considerations for sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in a 505(b)(2) application or a 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement, and sponsors may contact the relevant review division with any questions. If a sponsor anticipates that a planned 505(b)(2) application or 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement may not receive final approval before the transition date (e.g., due to the need for a second cycle of review, applicable unexpired exclusivity or listed patents, or a stay of approval due to patent infringement litigation), the sponsor should consider the following options:\n\nModifying the development program to support submission of an application or efficacy supplement under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a \"stand-alone\" BLA) before or after March 23, 2020. This may involve, for example, obtaining a right of reference from the application holder for the listed drug on which the proposed 505(b)(2) application or 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement would have relied or conducting studies with the proposed product to provide the scientific data that otherwise would have been relied upon to support approval of the application or the change proposed in the supplement, as applicable.20 Footnote 20: FDA has issued guidance for industry on Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Drug Products \u2013 Submitting NDAs and is considering how the concepts described in the guidance would apply to proposed pancreatic enzyme products submitted under the PHS Act.\n\nModifying the development program to support submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar product or a proposed interchangeable product at such time as there is a biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a reference product.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSponsors evaluating whether a proposed product could be submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act should consider whether they would be able to provide information demonstrating that, among other things, the proposed product:\n\nIs \"highly similar\" to a single reference product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, and that there are \"no clinically meaningful differences\" between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nHas the same route of administration, dosage form, and strength as the reference product;\n\nUtilizes the same mechanism(s) of action as the reference product for the proposed condition(s) of use (but only to the extent that the mechanism(s) of action are known); and\n\nSeeks licensure for a condition(s) of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) previously approved for the reference product.21\n\nFootnote 21: See section 351(k) of the PHS Act; see also, generally, FDA\u2019s guidance documents on biosimilar products.\n\nA sponsor of a proposed biological product that could meet the requirements for a proposed biosimilar and other applicable requirements would be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that cites the listed drug as its reference product after the NDA for the listed drug is deemed to be a BLA (or after another product that could be a reference product for the proposed product is licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act). Sponsors that intend to adapt their development programs to meet the requirements for a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act can request meetings with FDA, including a Biosimilar Biological Product Development (BPD) Type 3 meeting, before March 23, 2020, to support the development and review of a proposed biosimilar product or a proposed interchangeable product. Such meetings may be based on relevant comparative data with a listed drug that is the \"intended reference product\" (i.e., the listed drug that is intended to be the reference product after the NDA for such drug is deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act).\n\nProposed products that are intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different dosage forms, routes of administration, strengths, or conditions of use) from a previously approved product likely would need to be submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for a 351(a) BLA. Such products likely would be unable to use the 351(k) pathway to abbreviate their development program due to lack of a reference product or the inability to meet the statutory requirements for a proposed biosimilar product.\n\nA sponsor may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a product-specific basis regarding the development of a protein product intended for submission in an application under the FD&C Act (during the transitionperiod described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act) or under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act, as appropriate.22\n\nFootnote 22: For information on requesting a formal meeting regarding the development of a proposed biosimilar product intended for submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, see FDA\u2019s draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of BsUFA Products.

When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAs a general matter, in assessing the therapeutic equivalence of a proposed generic drug-device combination product, FDA intends to consider whether the proposed generic product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.50 While FDA does not expect the proposed generic combination product and its RLD to be identical in all respects, any differences identified between a proposed generic combination product and its RLD should be adequately analyzed, scientifically justified, and otherwise not preclude approval under an ANDA. The extent to which differences between the proposed generic combination product and the RLD affect the approximability of the ANDA product will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 314.3. See also the Orange Book, preface to the 41({}^{\\text{a}}) edition, at page vii.\n\nAppendix C Biologic-Led Combination Products\n\nBiologic-led combination products are licensed through one of the two BLA pathways under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), either under a section 351(a) BLA (i.e.,a stand-alone BLA) or under a section 351(k) BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product.51\n\nFootnote 52: Section 351(a)(2)(C) of the PHS Act.\n\n3.2.1 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) Submitted Under Section 351(a)\n\nTo be licensed, a biological product must be shown to be safe, pure, and potent, and the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held must meet standards designed to ensure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.52 A BLA submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act is a stand-alone application in that all of the information and data necessary to demonstrate that these requirements are met are included in the application. This pathway is generally appropriate for biologic-led combination products other than products that are proposed to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a previously licensed biological product.53\n\nFootnote 52: See footnote 17.\n\nFor example, this pathway would be appropriate for the following products when the sponsor is not seeking to rely on FDA's license of another biological product in order to demonstrate biosimilarity to, or interchangeability with, such product:\n\na gene therapy combined with a specialized delivery catheter\n\na vaccine in a pre-filled syringe\n\na protein product in an autoinjector\n\n_BLAs for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Submitted Under Section 351(k)_Section 351(k) of the PHS Act sets forth the requirements for the licensure of biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.54 Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean that the product \"is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences\" between the two products with respect to safety, purity, and potency. To meet the interchangeability standard, an applicant must show that its product \"is biosimilar to the reference product,\" and must further show that the product \"can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient\" and that, for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, \"the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the [two products] is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.\"55 Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nFDA has published guidance indicating the availability of this abbreviated pathway for combination products, as well as considerations related to demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability of such products. With respect to demonstrating biosimilarity, Q.I.4 of the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance) states that some design differences in the delivery device used with the proposed biosimilar product may be permissible, and explains that it may be possible to obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product in a pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, for example, even though the reference product is a biological product licensed in a vial presentation, provided that the proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standard for biosimilarity.\n\nThe Biosimilars Q&A Guidance also explains that licensure under section 351(k) would not be possible if design difference in a delivery device results in any of the following:\n\nA clinically meaningful difference between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nA different route of administration;\n\nA condition of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) for which the reference product has not been previously approved; or\n\nA proposed biosimilar product that otherwise does not meet the standard for biosimilarity.\n\nSee Biosimilars Q&A Guidance for considerations for seeking licensure of a combination product as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product.\n\nAnnex\n\nAnalysis of Pathway Availability for Device-Led Combination Products - Illustrative Examples\n\nTo date, questions regarding pathway availability for combination products have focused most often on device-led combination products. Accordingly, we have included this annex to address common questions utilizing the analyses discussed in section IV.1. The outcomes are also consistent with the expectations discussed in section III, that the application enable evaluation substantially similar to that which would occur if the constituent parts were reviewed under separate applications for the use.\n\nThese hypothetical examples are not intended to reflect a complete analysis of the premarket review considerations that need to be addressed for the types of products discussed in the examples or other types of combination products. In addition, specific products may raise distinct issues that are not taken into account in the examples below. If manufacturers have specific questions relating to their particular products, the Agency recommends that they contact the lead center for the product or OCP, as needed, for assistance.\n\nFor the purposes of the illustrative examples below, it is assumed that the sponsor submitted a 510(k) to CDRH for the combination product.\n\nExample 1: Antimicrobial coating added for the first time to a previously classified device type\n\nPredicate Product:\n\nA previously classified hypothetical class II device (product has no drug or biological product constituent part), which is subject to 510(k) requirements (e.g., an externally-communicating device intended to be implanted in the abdominal cavity for drainage of excessive fluids).\n\nDrug Constituent Part:\n\nA hypothetical antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) that contains the same active ingredient that is in an NDA drug product approved for intravenous administration that has a well-established and understood risk profile as an antimicrobial indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The sponsor has provided FDA documentation of a right of reference to the NDA.56\n\nFootnote 56: Alternatively, the sponsor could rely on FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the NDA approved antimicrobial product, provided all of the requirements of 503(g)(5)(A) and (C) are satisfied and it is scientifically justified. FDA may then consider such findings in its review of a device premarket submission.\n\nNew Product:\n\nThe sponsor proposes to add an antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) to the predicate product described above, making a single-entity combination product (hereinafter referred to as Product A). The purpose of adding the antimicrobial to this device is to prevent infections associated with the surgical procedure and continued use of the product. The sponsor requests the product be considered substantially equivalent to the previously cleared uncoated version of the device. An antimicrobial drug product has never been combined with this devicetype. To make a substantial equivalence determination, the following questions are generally asked:\n\nIs the predicate product legally marketed? Yes.\n\nDoes the predicate product have the same intended use? While both the predicate and the new combination product are intended to drain excessive fluid from the abdominal cavity, the addition of the proposed drug constituent part and the indication of preventing infection are not applicable to the predicate product. These changes raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, precluding a meaningful comparison with the predicate product.57 Therefore, these changes in indications for use of the product and of adding the constituent part would result in a new intended use, and the product would be found not substantially equivalent (NSE). Also, the addition of Antimicrobial A is a different technological characteristic that would raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 57: See 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5) and the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5784322023391724"], "Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: In summary, the CGMP regulations require that manufacturing processes be designed and controlled to assure that in-process materials and the finished product meet predetermined quality requirements and do so consistently and reliably.\n\nIV Recommendations\n\nIn the following sections, we describe general considerations for process validation, the recommended stages of process validation, and specific activities for each stage in the product lifecycle.\n\nGeneral Considerations for Process Validation\n\nIn all stages of the product lifecycle, good project management and good archiving that capture scientific knowledge will make the process validation program more effective and efficient. The following practices should ensure uniform collection and assessment of information about the process and enhance the accessibility of such information later in the product lifecycle.\n\nWe recommend an integrated team approach11 to process validation that includes expertise from a variety of disciplines (e.g., process engineering, industrial pharmacy, analytical chemistry, microbiology, statistics, manufacturing, and quality assurance). Project plans, along with the full support of senior management, are essential elements for success. Footnote 11: This concept is discussed in more detail in FDA\u2019s guidance for industry, Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory/Information/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, various studies can be initiated to discover, observe, correlate, or confirm information about the product and process. All studies should be planned and conducted according to sound scientific principles, appropriately documented, and approved in accordance with the established procedure appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle.\n\nThe terms attribute(s) (e.g., quality, product, component) and parameter(s) (e.g., process, operating, and equipment) are not categorized with respect to criticality in this guidance. With a lifecycle approach to process validation that employs risk based decision making throughout that lifecycle, the perception of criticality as a continuum rather than a binary state is more useful. All attributes and parameters should be evaluated in terms of their roles in the process and impact on the product or in-process material, and reevaluated as new information becomes available. The degree of control over those attributes or parameters should be commensurate with their risk to the process and process output. In other words, a higher degree of control is appropriate for attributes or parameters that pose a higher risk. The Agency recognizes that terminology usage can vary and expects that each manufacturer will communicate the meaning and intent of its terminology and categorization to the Agency.\n\nMany products are single-source or involve complicated manufacturing processes. Homogeneity within a batch and consistency between batches are goals of process validation activities. Validation offers assurance that a process is reasonably protected against sources of variability that could affect production output, cause supply problems, and negatively affect public health.\n\nStage 1 -- Process Design\n\nProcess design is the activity of defining the commercial manufacturing process that will be reflected in planned master production and control records. The goal of this stage is to design a process suitable for routine commercial manufacturing that can consistently deliver a product that meets its quality attributes.\n\nii.2.1 Building and Capturing Process Knowledge and Understanding\n\nGenerally, early process design experiments do not need to be performed under the CGMP conditions required for drugs intended for commercial distribution that are manufactured during Stage 2 (process qualification) and Stage 3 (continued process verification). They should, however, be conducted in accordance with sound scientific methods and principles, including good documentation practices. This recommendation is consistent with ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System.12 Decisions and justification of the controls should be sufficiently documented and internally reviewed to verify and preserve their value for use or adaptation later in the lifecycle of the process and product.\n\nFootnote 12: Available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nAlthough often performed at small-scale laboratories, most viral inactivation and impurity clearance studies cannot be considered early process design experiments. Viral and impurity clearance studies intended to evaluate and estimate product quality at commercial scale should have a level of quality unit oversight that will ensure that the studies follow sound scientific methods and principles and the conclusions are supported by the data.\n\nProduct development activities provide key inputs to the process design stage, such as the intended dosage form, the quality attributes, and a general manufacturing pathway. Process information available from product development activities can be leveraged in the process design stage. The functionality and limitations of commercial manufacturing equipment should be considered in the process design, as well as predicted contributions to variability posed by different component lots, production operators, environmental conditions, and measurement systems in the production setting. However, the full spectrum of input variability typical of commercial production is not generally known at this stage. Laboratory or pilot-scale models designed to be representative of the commercial process can be used to estimate variability.\n\nDesigning an efficient process with an effective process control approach is dependent on the process knowledge and understanding obtained. Design of Experiment (DOE) studies can help develop process knowledge by revealing relationships, including multivariate interactions, between the variable inputs (e.g., component characteristics 13 or process parameters) and the resulting outputs (e.g., in-process material, intermediates, or the final product). Risk analysis tools can be used to screen potential variables for DOE studies to minimize the total number of experiments conducted while maximizing knowledge gained. The results of DOE studies can provide justification for establishing ranges of incoming component quality, equipmentparameters, and in-process material quality attributes. FDA does not generally expect manufacturers to develop and test the process until it fails.\n\nOther activities, such as experiments or demonstrations at laboratory or pilot scale, also assist in evaluation of certain conditions and prediction of performance of the commercial process. These activities also provide information that can be used to model or simulate the commercial process. Computer-based or virtual simulations of certain unit operations or dynamics can provide process understanding and help avoid problems at commercial scale. It is important to understand the degree to which models represent the commercial process, including any differences that might exist, as this may have an impact on the relevance of information derived from the models.\n\nIt is essential that activities and studies resulting in process understanding be documented. Documentation should reflect the basis for decisions made about the process. For example, manufacturers should document the variables studied for a unit operation and the rationale for those variables identified as significant. This information is useful during the process qualification and continued process verification stages, including when the design is revised or the strategy for control is refined or changed.\n\nii.2.2 Establishing a Strategy for Process Control\n\nProcess knowledge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach to process control for each unit operation and the process overall. Strategies for process control can be designed to reduce input variation, adjust for input variation during manufacturing (and so reduce its impact on the output), or combine both approaches.\n\nProcess controls address variability to assure quality of the product. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points (SS 211.110(c)). Decisions regarding the type and extent of process controls can be aided by earlier risk assessments, then enhanced and improved as process experience is gained.\n\nFDA expects controls to include both examination of material quality and equipment monitoring. Special attention to control the process through operational limits and in-process monitoring is essential in two possible scenarios:\n\nWhen the product attribute is not readily measurable due to limitations of sampling or detectability (e.g., viral clearance or microbial contamination) or\n\nWhen intermediates and products cannot be highly characterized and well-defined quality attributes cannot be identified.\n\nThese controls are established in the master production and control records (see SS 211.186(a) and (b)(9)).\n\nMore advanced strategies, which may involve the use of process analytical technology (PAT), can include timely analysis and control loops to adjust the processing conditions so that the output remains constant. Manufacturing systems of this type can provide a higher degree of process control than non-PAT systems. In the case of a strategy using PAT, the approach to process qualification will differ from that used in other process designs. Further information on PAT processes can be found in FDA's guidance for industry on PAT -- A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance.14\n--------------------\nContext title: Process Validation- General Principles and Practices Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.092653751373291", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: Commercial Manufacturing (3.1.3)\n\nThe goals of manufacturing activities include achieving product realization, establishing and maintaining a state of control, and facilitating continual improvement. The pharmaceutical quality system should assure that the desired product quality is routinely met, suitable process performance is achieved, the set of controls are appropriate, improvement opportunities are identified and evaluated, and the body of knowledge is continually expanded.\n\nProduct Discontinuation (3.1.4)\n\nThe goal of product discontinuation activities is to manage the terminal stage of the product lifecycle effectively. For product discontinuation, a predefined approach should be used to manage activities such as retention of documentation and samples and continued product assessment (e.g., complaint handling and stability) and reporting in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System Elements (3.2)\n\nThe elements described below might be required in part under regional GMP regulations.\n\nHowever, the Q10 model's intent is to enhance these elements to promote the lifecycle approach to product quality. These four elements are:\n\nProcess performance and product quality monitoring system\n\nCorrective action and preventive action (CAPA) system\n\nChange management system\n\nManagement review of process performance and product quality\n\nThese elements should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognizing the differences among the stages and the different goals of each stage. Throughout the product lifecycle, companies are encouraged to evaluate opportunities for innovative approaches to improve product quality.\n\nEach element is followed by a table of example applications of the element to the stages of the pharmaceutical lifecycle.\n\nProcess Performance and Product Quality Monitoring System 3.2.1\n\nPharmaceutical companies should plan and execute a system for the monitoring of process performance and product quality to ensure a state of control is maintained. An effective monitoring system provides assurance of the continued capability of processes and controls to produce a product of desired quality and to identify areas for continual improvement. The process performance and product quality monitoring system should:1. Use quality risk management to establish the control strategy. This can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control. The control strategy should facilitate timely feedback/feedforward and appropriate corrective action and preventive action. 2. Provide the tools for measurement and analysis of parameters and attributes identified in the control strategy (e.g., data management and statistical tools). 3. Analyze parameters and attributes identified in the control strategy to verify continued operation within a state of control. 4. Identify sources of variation affecting process performance and product quality for potential continual improvement activities to reduce or control variation. 5. Include feedback on product quality from both internal and external sources (e.g., complaints, product rejections, nonconformances, recalls, deviations, audits and regulatory inspections, and findings). 6. Provide knowledge to enhance process understanding, enrich the design space (where established), and enable innovative approaches to process validation.\n\n3.2.2 Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) System (3.2.2)\n\nThe pharmaceutical company should have a system for implementing corrective actions and preventive actions resulting from the investigation of complaints, product rejections, nonconformances, recalls, deviations, audits, regulatory inspections and findings, and trends from process performance and product quality monitoring. A structured approach to the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{85.4pt}|p{85.4pt}|p{85.4pt}|p{85.4pt}|} \\hline\nPharmaceutical Development & Technology Transfer & Commercial Manufacturing & Product Discontinuation \\ \\hline Process and product knowledge generated and process and product monitoring & Monitoring during scale-up activities can provide a preliminary indication of process & A well-defined system for process & Once manufacturing ceases, monitoring such as stability testing should continue to completion of the studies.

The level of effort, formality, and documentation of the investigation should be commensurate with the level of risk, in line with ICH Q9. CAPA methodology should result in product and process improvements and enhanced product and process understanding.\n\n3.3.3 Change Management System (3.2.3)\n\nInnovation, continual improvement, the outputs of process performance and product quality monitoring, and CAPA drive change. To evaluate, approve, and implement these changes properly, a company should have an effective change management system. There is generally a difference in formality of change management processes prior to the initial regulatory submission and after submission, where changes to the regulatory filing might be required under regional requirements.\n\nThe change management system ensures continual improvement is undertaken in a timely and effective manner. It should provide a high degree of assurance there are no unintended consequences of the change.\n\nThe change management system should include the following, as appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle:\n\nQuality risk management should be utilized to evaluate proposed changes. The level of effort and formality of the evaluation should be commensurate with the level of risk.\n\nProposed changes should be evaluated relative to the marketing authorization, including design space, where established, and/or current product and process understanding. There should be an assessment to determine whether a change to the regulatory filing is required under regional requirements. As stated in ICH Q8, working within the design space is not considered a change (from a regulatory filing perspective). However, from a pharmaceutical quality system standpoint, all changes should be evaluated by a company's change management system.\n\nProposed changes should be evaluated by expert teams contributing the appropriate\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}} \\hline\nPharmaceutical Development & Technology Transfer & Commercial Manufacturing & Product Discontinuation \\ \\hline Product or process variability is explored.

After implementation, an evaluation of the change should be undertaken to confirm the change objectives were achieved and that there was no deleterious impact on product quality.\n\n3.2.4 Management Review of Process Performance and Product Quality (3.2.4)\n\nManagement review should provide assurance that process performance and product quality are managed over the lifecycle. Depending on the size and complexity of the company, management review can be a series of reviews at various levels of management and should include a timely and effective communication and escalation process to raise appropriate quality issues to senior levels of management for review.\n\nThe management review system should include: 1. The results of regulatory inspections and findings, audits and other assessments, and commitments made to regulatory authorities 2. Periodic quality reviews, that can include: 1. Measures of customer satisfaction such as product quality complaints and recalls 2. Conclusions of process performance and product quality monitoring 3. The effectiveness of process and product changes including those arising from corrective action and preventive actions 3. Any follow-up actions from previous management reviews 2. The management review system should identify appropriate actions, such as: 1. Improvements to manufacturing processes and products 2.

FDA will publish a notice in the Federal Register of advisory committee meetings. In general, ten copies of written submissions to a committee are to be sent to the executive secretary unless otherwise specified in the Federal Register notice.24 Submissions for a Public Hearing under Part 14 do not need to be sent to FDA's Dockets Management Staff.\n\nFootnote 24: 21 CFR 14.35(a).\n\n4 Public Hearing Before the FDA Commissioner (21 CFR Part 15)\n\nA hearing under Part 15 is held at the discretion of the Commissioner, when provided by law or regulation, or as an alternative to a formal evidentiary hearing (where granted in the discretion of the Commissioner), to permit persons to present information and views at a public hearing on any matter pending before the FDA. Examples of issues that can be referred to a Part 15 hearing include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nProposals to allow persons to order custom devices;\n\nProposed Quality System (formerly Good Manufacturing Practice) Regulation;\n\nProposed exemptions from federal preemption of state and local device requirements.25\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 808.25(e).\n\nFDA will publish a notice of hearing in the Federal Register. The scope of a hearing is determined by the notice of hearing and any regulation under which the hearing is held. A person may submit information or views on the subject of the hearing in writing to FDA's Dockets Management Staff as described previously.26\n\nFootnote 26: 21 CFR 15.25.\n\n5 Regulatory Hearing Before the FDA (21 CFR Part 16)\n\nA hearing under 21 CFR Part 16 (Regulatory Hearing Before the Food and Drug Administration) is called at the discretion of the FDA Commissioner when considering regulatory action, or when provided by law or regulation. Part 16 provides an opportunity for a regulatory hearing on various matters including but not limited to:\n\nSections 520(g)(4) and (g)(5) of the FD&C Act, relating to disapproval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or notice of a proposed withdrawal of approval;\n\n21 CFR 814.46(c), relating to withdrawal of approval of a PMA;\n\nRescission of a 510(k) clearance;\n\nAn order suspending or revoking an FDA certificate issued to a U.S. mammography facility pursuant to the MQSA.\n\nA regulatory hearing is initiated by a notice of opportunity for hearing from FDA.

Under 21 CFR 16.26(a), a request for a hearing may be denied if the request fails to demonstrate a genuine and substantial issue of fact that warrants a hearing; therefore, the request should specify the grounds for the hearing request. FDA and the party requesting the hearing will, if feasible, at least one day before the hearing provide to each other written notice of any published articles or written information to be presented or relied on at the hearing. A regulatory hearing is informal and the rules of evidence do not apply.27\n\nFootnote 27: 21 CFR 16.60(c).\n\nVI Judicial Review\n\nFDA is frequently asked about judicial remedies. A party seeking judicial review of a final action taken by FDA should consult its attorney or perform its own research of applicable statutes and regulations. It is not appropriate for FDA to offer advice or assistance concerning whether, and how, a party may seek judicial review of an adverse decision, and nothing in this guidance should be construed as constraining the ability of a stakeholder to exercise any remedies provided by statute or regulation.\n\nIn general, FDA believes it is in the public interest for parties to avail themselves of administrative remedies within the agency prior to engaging in litigation, so that FDA has the opportunity to reconsider and review any dispute concerning an FDA action before it is referred to judicial review.28 In the event that a petitioner brings judicial action relating to a matter that is subject to a pending review under 21 CFR 10.75 or 10.33, or any other administrative process, the Commissioner may request that the court refer the matter back to the Agency or hold its review in abeyance pending completion of administrative reconsideration.29 Moreover, the Commissioner will generally consider a petition for reconsideration only before the petitioner brings legal action in the courts.\n\nFootnote 28: 21 CFR 10.45.\n\nFootnote 29: 21 CFR 10.33(h).\n\nVII Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 8 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.0026092529296875", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.1.3 Commercial Manufacturing\n\nThe goals of manufacturing activities include achieving product realisation, establishing and maintaining a state of control and facilitating continual improvement. The pharmaceutical quality system should assure that the desired product quality is routinely met, suitable process performance is achieved, the set of controls are appropriate, improvement opportunities are identified and evaluated, and the body of knowledge is continually expanded.\n\n3.1.4 Product Discontinuation\n\nThe goal of product discontinuation activities is to manage the terminal stage of the product lifecycle effectively. For product discontinuation, a pre-defined approach should be used to manage activities such as retention of documentation and samples and continued product assessment (e.g., complaint handling and stability) and reporting in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System Elements\n\nThe elements described below might be, required in part under regional GMP regulations. However, the Q10 model's intent is to enhance these elements in order to promote the lifecycle approach to product quality. These four elements are:\n\nProcess performance and product quality monitoring system;\n\nCorrective action and preventive action (CAPA) system;\n\nChange management system;Management review of process performance and product quality.\n\nThese elements should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognising the differences among, and the different goals of, each stage. Throughout the product lifecycle, companies are encouraged to evaluate opportunities for innovative approaches to improve product quality.\n\nEach element is followed by a table of example applications of the element to the stages of the pharmaceutical lifecycle.\n\n3.2.1 Process Performance and Product Quality Monitoring System\n\nPharmaceutical companies should plan and execute a system for the monitoring of process performance and product quality to ensure a state of control is maintained. An effective monitoring system provides assurance of the continued capability of processes and controls to produce a product of desired quality and to identify areas for continual improvement. The process performance and product quality monitoring system should:\n\nUse quality risk management to establish the control strategy. This can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control. The control strategy should facilitate timely feedback / feedforward and appropriate corrective action and preventive action;\n\nProvide the tools for measurement and analysis of parameters and attributes identified in the control strategy (e.g., data management and statistical tools);\n--------------------\nContext title: Q10 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.097567558288574", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: Drug CGMPs: The current good manufacturing practice regulations set forth in 21 CFR 210 and 21 CFR part 211.

HARMONISED TRIPARTITE GUIDELINE\n\nGood Manufacturing Practice Guide for\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nQ7\n\nCurrent Step 4 version\n\ndated 10 November 2000\n\nThis Guideline has been developed by the appropriate ICH Expert Working Group and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH Process. At Step 4 of the Process the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and USA.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n1 Introduction\n\nObjective\n\nThis document (Guide) is intended to provide guidance regarding good manufacturing practice (GMP) for the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) under an appropriate system for managing quality. It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide \"manufacturing\" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term \"should\" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms \"current good manufacturing practices\" and \"good manufacturing practices\" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.1405613422393799", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: The ICH guidance for industry Q7A Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients provides guidance for manufacturing under an appropriate system for managing quality.\n\nThe ICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals provides an overall description of what nonclinical studies of biological products should be considered to support clinical trials.\n\nThe draft guidance for industry Microbiological Data for Systemic Antibacterial Drug Products -- Development, Analysis, and Presentation provides an overview of the nonclinical microbiology studies that help to support clinical development.23 Footnote 23: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nThe guidance for industry Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products describes in general the types of information that should accompany an IND submission. See also the Questions and Answers companion document.\n\nThe guidance for industry INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies -- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information describes the CMC information that should be submitted for phase 2 and phase 3 trials conducted under INDs.\n\nAppendix 2 Guidances for clinical development24\n\nFootnote 24: These guidances can be found on the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThe following guidances can be useful in the area of clinical development of drugs for NTDs:\n\nThe ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials summarizes statistical areas for clinical trials.\n\nThe ICH guidance for industry E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials highlights some of the important aspects of using an appropriate control group. The guidance discusses some of the considerations for the noninferiority trial to ensure the appropriate demonstration of efficacy when compared to an active-controlled drug.\n\nEffective treatment of some NTDs includes the use of combinations of antimicrobial drugs to enhance efficacy or prevent the development of resistant pathogens. Some development programs may include two or more new investigational drugs. The guidance for industry Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination covers this area.\n\nSome NTDs have known effective treatment, and clinical trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of an investigational drug to the control drug can be used in this situation. The noninferiority clinical trial design poses some unique scientific and regulatory challenges, which focus on an ability to describe a reliable treatment effect of the control drug. Two guidances in this area include the draft guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials25 and the guidance for industry Antibacterial Drug Products: Use of Noninferiority Trials to Support Approval. Footnote 25: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nThe principles of good meeting management practices and standardized procedures for meetings are outlined in the guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants.\n\nThe guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products provides a general overview of the approach to demonstrating effectiveness.\n\nThe draft guidance for industry Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases explains the FDA's current thinking about possible streamlined development programs and clinical trial designs for drugs to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients who have an unmet medical need.26\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 The FDA's\n2.1 The FDA's\n2.2 The FDA's\n2.3 The FDA's\n2.4 The FDA's\n2.5 The FDA's\n2.6 The FDA's\n2.7 The FDA's\n2.8 The FDA's\n2.9 The FDA's\n\n2.10 The FDA's\n\n2.11 The FDA's\n\n2.12 The FDA's\n\n2.13 The FDA's\n\n2.14 The FDA's\n\n2.15 The FDA's\n\n2.16 The FDA's\n\n2.17 The FDA's\n\n2.18 The FDA's\n\n2.19 The FDA's\n\n2.20 The FDA's\n\n2.21 The FDA's\n\n2.22 The FDA's\n\n2.23 The FDA's\n\n2.24 The FDA's\n\n2.25 The FDA's\n\n2.26 The FDA's\n\n2.27 When final, this guidance will represent the FDA's current thinking on this topic.\n--------------------\nContext title: Neglected Tropical Diseases of the Developing World- Developing Drugs for Treatment or Prevention \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.12987108528614044", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Final Concept Paper\n\nICH Q7 Q&As\n\nQ7: Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nDated and endorsed by the Steering Committee: 17 October 2012\n\nType of Harmonization Action Proposed\n\nImplementation Working Group (Q7 IWG) on Q7 (Q&A document).\n\nStatement of the Perceived Problem\n\nThe ICH Q7 Guideline is implemented successfully in the regulatory framework by WHO and most authorities around the world. However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1948095560073853", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Q7 Implementation Working Group\n\nICH Q7 Guideline: Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nCurrent version\n\ndated 10 June 2015\n\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use\n\nICH Secretarial, Chemin des Mines 9, P.O.

Changes in batch size within the approved batch size range can be managed within the PQS. Any post-approval change beyond the approved range should be supported by data (Section 3.2) and appropriately managed (i.e., prior approval or notification).\n\nA suitable quantitative metric with acceptance criteria should be defined within the PQS to establish batch-to-batch consistency and system robustness. For example, when a batch size is defined by the amount of collected material, the amount of diverted materials relative to that of collected materials for each batch should be considered.\n\nThe actual intended size of a given batch should be defined before manufacturing begins.\n\nProcess Models\n\nThe level of detail provided in the dossier regarding model development, validation, and maintenance over the lifecycle should be commensurate with the model type and impact category. The process model should be specific for the defined system (e.g., equipment, layout, connections). Information to support models used as part of commercial manufacturing should be available during site inspection and maintained at or be accessible to the manufacturing site. Refer to Points to Consider: ICH-Endorsed Guide for ICH Q8/Q9/Q10 Implementation for regulatory expectations on process models.\n\nDrug Substance and Drug Product Stability\n\nRegulatory expectations for the stability data package generally do not differ between CM and batch manufacturing modes (refer to ICH Q1A, ICH Q5C). Batches used to generate primary stability data should be manufactured using a manufacturing process and equipment representative of the commercial process. Primary stability batches should incorporate the variability described in the ICH stability guidelines (e.g., different drug substance batches).\n\nAdditionally, for chemical drug substances or drug products:\n\nStability batches could be obtained with a single start-up/shutdown sequence provided the aforementioned variability is incorporated into the batches (e.g., by introducing different batches of drug substances in a sequential manner).\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8167248964309692", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Adoption of the principles in this guidance can support the justification of alternative approaches to the setting of specification attributes and acceptance criteria as described in ICH Q6A and Q6B.\n\nProduct Lifecycle Management and Continual Improvement (2.6)\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, companies have opportunities to evaluate innovative approaches to improve product quality (see ICH Q10).\n\nProcess performance can be monitored to ensure that it is working as anticipated to deliver product quality attributes as predicted by the design space. This monitoring could include trend analysis of the manufacturing process as additional experience is gained during routinemanufacture. For certain design spaces using mathematical models, periodic maintenance could be useful to ensure the model's performance. The model maintenance is an example of activity that can be managed within a company's own internal quality system provided the design space is unchanged.\n\nExpansion, reduction, or redefinition of the design space could be desired upon gaining additional process knowledge. Change of design space is subject to regional requirements.\n\nIII Submission of Pharmaceutical Development and Related Information in Common Technical Document (CTD) Format (3)\n\nPharmaceutical development information is submitted in Section P.2 of the CTD. Other information resulting from pharmaceutical development studies could be accommodated by the CTD format in a number of different ways, and some specific suggestions are provided below. However, the applicant should clearly indicate where the different information is located. In addition to what is submitted in the application, certain aspects described in this guidance (e.g., product lifecycle management, continual improvement) are handled under the applicant's pharmaceutical quality system (see ICH Q10).\n\nQuality Risk Management and Product and Process Development (3.1)\n\nQuality risk management can be used at different stages during product and process development and manufacturing implementation. The assessments used to guide and justify development decisions can be included in the relevant sections of P.2. For example, risk analyses and functional relationships linking material attributes and process parameters to product CQAs can be included in P.2.1, P.2.2, and P.2.3. Risk analyses linking the design of the manufacturing process to product quality can be included in P.2.3.\n\nDesign Space (3.2)\n\nAs an element of the proposed manufacturing process, the design space(s) can be described in the section of the application that includes the description of the manufacturing process and process controls (P.3.3). If appropriate, additional information can be provided in the section of the application that addresses the controls of critical steps and intermediates (P.3.4). The product and manufacturing process development sections of the application (P.2.1, P.2.2, and P.2.3) are appropriate places to summarize and describe product and process development studies that provide the basis for the design space(s). The relationship of the design space(s) to the overall control strategy can be discussed in the section of the application that includes the justification of the drug product specification (P.5.6).\n\nControl Strategy (3.3)\n\nThe section of the application that includes the justification of the drug product specification (P.5.6) is a good place to summarize the overall drug product control strategy. However, detailed information about input material controls and process controls should still be provided in the appropriate CTD format sections (e.g., drug substance section (S), control of excipients (P.4),description of manufacturing process and process controls (P.3.3), controls of critical steps and intermediates (P.3.4)).\n\nDrug Substance Related Information (3.4)\n\nIf drug substance CQAs have the potential to affect the CQAs or manufacturing process of the drug product, some discussion of drug substance CQAs can be appropriate in the pharmaceutical development section of the application (e.g., P.2.1).\n\nIV Annex Glossary (4)\n\nControl Strategy: A planned set of controls, derived from current product and process understanding that ensures process performance and product quality. The controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control. (ICH Q10)\n\nCritical Process Parameter (CPP): A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality.\n\nCritical Quality Attribute (CQA): A physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality.\n\nDesign Space: The multidimensional combination and interaction of input variables (e.g., material attributes) and process parameters that have been demonstrated to provide assurance of quality. Working within the design space is not considered as a change. Movement out of the design space is considered to be a change and would normally initiate a regulatory postapproval change process. Design space is proposed by the applicant and is subject to regulatory assessment and approval (ICH Q8).\n\nLifecycle: All phases in the life of a product from the initial development through marketing until the product's discontinuation (ICH Q8).\n\nProven Acceptable Range: A characterized range of a process parameter for which operation within this range, while keeping other parameters constant, will result in producing a material meeting relevant quality criteria.\n\nQuality: The suitability of either a drug substance or a drug product for its intended use. This term includes such attributes as the identity, strength, and purity (ICH Q6A).\n\nQuality by Design (QbD): A systematic approach to development that begins with predefined objectives and emphasizes product and process understanding and process control, based on sound science and quality risk management.\n\nQuality Target Product Profile (QTPP): A prospective summary of the quality characteristics of a drug product that ideally will be achieved to ensure the desired quality, taking into account safety and efficacy of the drug product.\n\nReal-Time Release Testing: The ability to evaluate and ensure the quality of in-process and/or final product based on process data, which typically include a valid combination of measured material attributes and process controls.\n\nAppendix 1 Differing Approaches to Pharmaceutical Development\n\nThe following table has been developed to illustrate some potential contrasts between what might be considered a minimal approach and an enhanced, quality by design approach regarding different aspects of pharmaceutical development and lifecycle management. The comparisons are shown merely to aid in the understanding of a range of potential approaches to pharmaceutical development and should not be considered to be all-encompassing. The table is not intended to specifically define the only approach a company could choose to follow. In the enhanced approach, establishing a design space or using real time release testing is not necessarily expected. Current practices in the pharmaceutical industry vary and typically lie between the two approaches presented in the table.\n\nAppendix 2 Illustrative Examples\n\nUse of a Risk Assessment Tool\n\nFor example, a cross-functional team of experts could work together to develop an Ishikawa (fishbone) diagram that identifies potential variables that can have an impact on the desired quality attribute. The team could then rank the variables based on probability, severity, and detectability using failure mode effects analysis (FMEA) or similar tools based on prior knowledge and initial experimental data. Design of experiments or other experimental approaches could then be used to evaluate the impact of the higher ranked variables, to gain greater understanding of the process, and to develop a proper control strategy.\n\nIshikawa Diagram\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n2.2.1 Depiction of Interactions\n\nThe figure below depicts the presence or absence of interactions among three process parameters on the level of degradation product (\\mathrm{Y}). The figure shows a series of two-dimensional plots showing the effect of interactions among three process parameters (initial moisture content, temperature, mean particle size) of the drying operation of a granulate (drug product intermediate) on degradation product (\\mathrm{Y}). The relative slopes of the lines or curves within a plot indicate if interaction is present. In this example, initial moisture content and temperature are interacting; but initial moisture content and mean particle size are not, nor are temperature and mean particle size.\n\nPresentations of Design Space\n\nExample 1: Response graphs for dissolution are depicted as a surface plot (Figure 0(a)) and a contour plot (Figure 0(b)). Parameters 1 and 2 are factors of a granulation operation that affect the dissolution rate of a tablet (e.g., excipient attribute, water amount, granule size.)\n\nTwo examples are given of potential design spaces. In Figure 0(c), the design space is defined by a nonlinear combination of parameter ranges that delivers the dissolution critical quality attribute. In this example, the design space is expressed by the response surface equation resolved at the limit for satisfactory response (i.e., 80% dissolution). The acceptable range of one parameter is dependent on the value of the other. For example:\n\nIf Parameter 1 has a value of 46, then Parameter 2 has a range of 0 and 1.5\n--------------------\nContext title: Q8(R2) Pharmaceutical Development \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.830535411834717"], "As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: The \"Supplement Facts\" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter \"o,\" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement \"Made in the U. S. A.\"? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements. The U.S. Customs Service regulates country of origin marking (i.e., \"Made in the U.S.A.\") as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930. Their website is www.customs.ustreas.gov.\n* 13.How do I obtain a UPC bar code? The UPC bar code may be obtained from the Uniform Code Council. Their website is www.uc-council.org. Click on the button that says \"I Need a UPC Bar Code.\"\n* 14.Must expiration dating be included on the label of dietary supplements? No. However, a firm may include this information if it is supported by valid data demonstrating that it is not false or misleading.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter I.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (\"the final rule\"). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" and \"I\" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of \"infants\" (or \"infants 7 to 12 months\") and \"children less than 4 years\" have been changed to \"infants through 12 months\" and \"children 1 through 3 years of age\" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines \"food\" as: \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of \"drug\") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of \"food,\" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8609188199043274", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nYou must identify a dietary supplement by using the term \"dietary supplement\" in the statement of identity, except that you may delete the word \"dietary\" and replace it with the name of the dietary ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., \"calcium supplement\") or an appropriately descriptive term indicating the type of dietary ingredient(s) in your dietary supplement product (e.g., \"herbal supplement with vitamins\").\n\n21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(C), 21 U.S.C. 343(s)(2)(B) and 21 CFR 101.3(g)\n\n3. Can the term \"dietary supplement\" by itself be considered the statement of identity?\n\nYes. This term describes the basic nature of a dietary supplement and therefore is an \"appropriately descriptive term\" that can be used as the product's statement of identity. The statement of identity for a dietary supplement may therefore consist simply of the term \"dietary supplement,\" or \"dietary supplement\" may be part of a longer statement of identity (e.g., \"cod liver oil liquid dietary supplement\"). In either case, the word \"dietary\" may be deleted and replaced by another appropriately descriptive term identifying the contents of the product, such as \"calcium supplement,\" \"herbal supplement\", or \"herbal supplement with vitamins.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.3(g)\n\n4. Should I make the statement of identity stand out?\n\nYes. You must make the statement of identity one of the most important features on the principal display panel. To do this, you must use bold type and a type size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the front panel of your label.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n\n5. How should I place the statement of identity on the principal display panel?\n\nYou must place the statement of identity of your dietary supplement product in lines generally parallel to the base of the package.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter II.

If the principal display panel of your product is 5square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent does not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of 21 CFR 101.105(f)\n3. How must I express the net quantity of contents statement on my label? You must express the net quantity of contents statement in either weight, measure, numerical count or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. When you express this quantity as a weight or measure, you must specify both metric (grams, kilograms, milliliters, or liters) and U.S. Customary System (ounces, pounds, or fluid ounces) terms. Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992 and 21 CFR 101.105\n4. Why must I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You must calculate the area of the principal display panel (calculated in square inches or square centimeters) to determine the minimum type size that is permitted for the net quantity of contents statement.\n5. How do I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You may calculate the area of the principal display panel for rectangular or square shaped packages by multiplying the height by the width (both in inches or both in centimeters), and for cylindrical shaped packages by multiplying 40% of the circumference by the height. For example, a rectangular package that is 8 inches high and 6 inches wide would have a principal display panel of 48 square inches. A cylindrical package having a circumference of 10 inches and a height of 2 inches would have a principal display panel of 8 square inches.\n6. Am I required to place the net quantity of contents statement conspicuously and prominently on my product labels? Yes. You are required to use a print style that is prominent, conspicuous, and easy to read, with letters not more than three times as high as wide. Use letters that contrast sufficiently with the background.\n7. What is the minimum type size that I can use for the net quantity of contents statements? The smallest type size permitted for the net quantity of contents statement is based on the size of the principal display panel. You may determine the height of the type by measuring the height of upper case letters, when only upper case letters are used, or the height of a lower case letter \"o,\" or its equivalent, when mixed upper and lower case letters are used. The table below sets out the minimum type size in inches (in.), with metric equivalents (millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm)) in parentheses.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nMinimum Type Size & Area of Principal Display Panel \\ \\hline\n1/16 in.

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide \"manufacturing\" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term \"should\" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms \"current good manufacturing practices\" and \"good manufacturing practices\" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.3301079273223877", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: The ICH guidance for industry Q7A Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients provides guidance for manufacturing under an appropriate system for managing quality.\n\nThe ICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals provides an overall description of what nonclinical studies of biological products should be considered to support clinical trials.\n\nThe draft guidance for industry Microbiological Data for Systemic Antibacterial Drug Products -- Development, Analysis, and Presentation provides an overview of the nonclinical microbiology studies that help to support clinical development.23 Footnote 23: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nThe guidance for industry Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products describes in general the types of information that should accompany an IND submission.

The guidance discusses some of the considerations for the noninferiority trial to ensure the appropriate demonstration of efficacy when compared to an active-controlled drug.\n\nEffective treatment of some NTDs includes the use of combinations of antimicrobial drugs to enhance efficacy or prevent the development of resistant pathogens. Some development programs may include two or more new investigational drugs. The guidance for industry Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination covers this area.\n\nSome NTDs have known effective treatment, and clinical trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of an investigational drug to the control drug can be used in this situation. The noninferiority clinical trial design poses some unique scientific and regulatory challenges, which focus on an ability to describe a reliable treatment effect of the control drug. Two guidances in this area include the draft guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials25 and the guidance for industry Antibacterial Drug Products: Use of Noninferiority Trials to Support Approval. Footnote 25: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nThe principles of good meeting management practices and standardized procedures for meetings are outlined in the guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants.\n\nThe guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products provides a general overview of the approach to demonstrating effectiveness.\n\nThe draft guidance for industry Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases explains the FDA's current thinking about possible streamlined development programs and clinical trial designs for drugs to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients who have an unmet medical need.26\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 The FDA's\n2.1 The FDA's\n2.2 The FDA's\n2.3 The FDA's\n2.4 The FDA's\n2.5 The FDA's\n2.6 The FDA's\n2.7 The FDA's\n2.8 The FDA's\n2.9 The FDA's\n\n2.10 The FDA's\n\n2.11 The FDA's\n\n2.12 The FDA's\n\n2.13 The FDA's\n\n2.14 The FDA's\n\n2.15 The FDA's\n\n2.16 The FDA's\n\n2.17 The FDA's\n\n2.18 The FDA's\n\n2.19 The FDA's\n\n2.20 The FDA's\n\n2.21 The FDA's\n\n2.22 The FDA's\n\n2.23 The FDA's\n\n2.24 The FDA's\n\n2.25 The FDA's\n\n2.26 The FDA's\n\n2.27 When final, this guidance will represent the FDA's current thinking on this topic.\n--------------------\nContext title: Neglected Tropical Diseases of the Developing World- Developing Drugs for Treatment or Prevention \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1694021224975586", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Final Concept Paper\n\nICH Q7 Q&As\n\nQ7: Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nDated and endorsed by the Steering Committee: 17 October 2012\n\nType of Harmonization Action Proposed\n\nImplementation Working Group (Q7 IWG) on Q7 (Q&A document).\n\nStatement of the Perceived Problem\n\nThe ICH Q7 Guideline is implemented successfully in the regulatory framework by WHO and most authorities around the world. However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.1556713581085205", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where:\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified;\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established;\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API.\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process.\n\nProcess Validation Program\n\nThe number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified.\n\nCritical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation.\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to or better than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies.\n\nPeriodic Review of Validated Systems\n\nSystems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation.\n\nCleaning Validation\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4473763704299927", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Prospective validation should normally be performed for all API processes as defined in 12.1. Prospective validation of an API process should be completed before the commercial distribution of the final drug product manufactured from that API. (12.42)\n\nConcurrent validation can be conducted when data from replicate production runs are unavailable because only a limited number of API batches have been produced, API batches are produced infrequently, or API batches are produced by a validated process that has been modified. Prior to the completion of concurrent validation, batches can be released and used in final drug product for commercial distribution based on thorough monitoring and testing of the API batches. (12.43)\n\nAn exception can be made for retrospective validation of well-established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where the following apply: (12.44)\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches produced during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency.

(12.45)\n\nProcess Validation Program (12.5)\n\nThe number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from 10 to 30 consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified. (12.50)Critical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation. (12.51)\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to, or better than, historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies. (12.52)\n\nPeriodic Review of Validated Systems (12.6)\n\nSystems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation. (12.60)\n\nCleaning Validation (12.7)\n\nCleaning procedures should normally be validated. In general, cleaning validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or carryover of materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. For example, in early production it may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where residues are removed by subsequent purification steps. (12.70)\n\nValidation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage patterns. If various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or API can be selected for cleaning validation. This selection should be based on the solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on potency, toxicity, and stability. (12.71)\n\nThe cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned, procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and controlled, and analytical methods. The protocol should also indicate the type of samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labeled. (12.72)\n\nSampling should include swabing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. The sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. Swab sampling may be impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such as micronizers and microfluidizers). (12.73)\n\nValidated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or contaminants should be used. The detection limit for each analytical method should be sufficiently sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or contaminant. The method's attainable recovery level should be established. Residue limits should be practical, achievable, verifiable, and based on the most deleterious residue. Limits can be established based on the minimum known pharmacological, toxicological, or physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component. (12.74)\n\nEquipment cleaning/sanitation studies should address microbiological and endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile products). (12.75)\n\nCleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after validation to ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine production. Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual examination, where feasible. Visual inspection can allow detection of gross contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by sampling and/or analysis. (12.76)\n\nValidation of Analytical Methods (12.8)\n\nAnalytical methods should be validated unless the method employed is included in the relevant pharmacopoeia or other recognized standard reference. The suitability of all testing methods used should nonetheless be verified under actual conditions of use and documented. (12.80)\n\nMethods should be validated to include consideration of characteristics included within the ICH guidances on validation of analytical methods. The degree of analytical validation performed should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the stage of the API production process. (12.81)\n\nAppropriate qualification of analytical equipment should be considered before initiating validation of analytical methods. (12.82)\n\nComplete records should be maintained of any modification of a validated analytical method. Such records should include the reason for the modification and appropriate data to verify that the modification produces results that are as accurate and reliable as the established method. (12.83)\n\nChange Control (13)\n\nA formal change control system should be established to evaluate all changes that could affect the production and control of the intermediate or API. (13.10)\n\nWritten procedures should provide for the identification, documentation, appropriate review, and approval of changes in raw materials, specifications, analytical methods, facilities, support systems, equipment (including computer hardware), processing steps, labeling and packaging materials, and computer software. (13.11)\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAny proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the appropriate organizational units and reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s). (13.12)\n\nThe potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated process. Changes can be classified (e.g., as minor or major) depending on the nature and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. Scientific judgment should determine what additional testing and validation studies are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process. (13.13)\n\nWhen implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure that all documents affected by the changes are revised. (13.14)\n\nAfter the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the first batches produced or tested under the change. (13.15)\n\nThe potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be added to the stability monitoring program. (13.16)\n\nCurrent dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from established production and process control procedures that can affect the quality of the API. (13.17)\n\nXiv Rejection and Re-Use of Materials (14)\n\nRejection (14.1)\n\nIntermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be identified as such and quarantined. These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or reworked as described below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.928346872329712", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: In summary, the CGMP regulations require that manufacturing processes be designed and controlled to assure that in-process materials and the finished product meet predetermined quality requirements and do so consistently and reliably.\n\nIV Recommendations\n\nIn the following sections, we describe general considerations for process validation, the recommended stages of process validation, and specific activities for each stage in the product lifecycle.\n\nGeneral Considerations for Process Validation\n\nIn all stages of the product lifecycle, good project management and good archiving that capture scientific knowledge will make the process validation program more effective and efficient. The following practices should ensure uniform collection and assessment of information about the process and enhance the accessibility of such information later in the product lifecycle.\n\nWe recommend an integrated team approach11 to process validation that includes expertise from a variety of disciplines (e.g., process engineering, industrial pharmacy, analytical chemistry, microbiology, statistics, manufacturing, and quality assurance). Project plans, along with the full support of senior management, are essential elements for success. Footnote 11: This concept is discussed in more detail in FDA\u2019s guidance for industry, Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory/Information/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, various studies can be initiated to discover, observe, correlate, or confirm information about the product and process. All studies should be planned and conducted according to sound scientific principles, appropriately documented, and approved in accordance with the established procedure appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle.\n\nThe terms attribute(s) (e.g., quality, product, component) and parameter(s) (e.g., process, operating, and equipment) are not categorized with respect to criticality in this guidance. With a lifecycle approach to process validation that employs risk based decision making throughout that lifecycle, the perception of criticality as a continuum rather than a binary state is more useful. All attributes and parameters should be evaluated in terms of their roles in the process and impact on the product or in-process material, and reevaluated as new information becomes available. The degree of control over those attributes or parameters should be commensurate with their risk to the process and process output. In other words, a higher degree of control is appropriate for attributes or parameters that pose a higher risk. The Agency recognizes that terminology usage can vary and expects that each manufacturer will communicate the meaning and intent of its terminology and categorization to the Agency.\n\nMany products are single-source or involve complicated manufacturing processes. Homogeneity within a batch and consistency between batches are goals of process validation activities. Validation offers assurance that a process is reasonably protected against sources of variability that could affect production output, cause supply problems, and negatively affect public health.\n\nStage 1 -- Process Design\n\nProcess design is the activity of defining the commercial manufacturing process that will be reflected in planned master production and control records. The goal of this stage is to design a process suitable for routine commercial manufacturing that can consistently deliver a product that meets its quality attributes.\n\nii.2.1 Building and Capturing Process Knowledge and Understanding\n\nGenerally, early process design experiments do not need to be performed under the CGMP conditions required for drugs intended for commercial distribution that are manufactured during Stage 2 (process qualification) and Stage 3 (continued process verification). They should, however, be conducted in accordance with sound scientific methods and principles, including good documentation practices. This recommendation is consistent with ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System.12 Decisions and justification of the controls should be sufficiently documented and internally reviewed to verify and preserve their value for use or adaptation later in the lifecycle of the process and product.\n\nFootnote 12: Available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nAlthough often performed at small-scale laboratories, most viral inactivation and impurity clearance studies cannot be considered early process design experiments. Viral and impurity clearance studies intended to evaluate and estimate product quality at commercial scale should have a level of quality unit oversight that will ensure that the studies follow sound scientific methods and principles and the conclusions are supported by the data.\n\nProduct development activities provide key inputs to the process design stage, such as the intended dosage form, the quality attributes, and a general manufacturing pathway. Process information available from product development activities can be leveraged in the process design stage. The functionality and limitations of commercial manufacturing equipment should be considered in the process design, as well as predicted contributions to variability posed by different component lots, production operators, environmental conditions, and measurement systems in the production setting. However, the full spectrum of input variability typical of commercial production is not generally known at this stage. Laboratory or pilot-scale models designed to be representative of the commercial process can be used to estimate variability.\n\nDesigning an efficient process with an effective process control approach is dependent on the process knowledge and understanding obtained. Design of Experiment (DOE) studies can help develop process knowledge by revealing relationships, including multivariate interactions, between the variable inputs (e.g., component characteristics 13 or process parameters) and the resulting outputs (e.g., in-process material, intermediates, or the final product). Risk analysis tools can be used to screen potential variables for DOE studies to minimize the total number of experiments conducted while maximizing knowledge gained. The results of DOE studies can provide justification for establishing ranges of incoming component quality, equipmentparameters, and in-process material quality attributes. FDA does not generally expect manufacturers to develop and test the process until it fails.\n\nOther activities, such as experiments or demonstrations at laboratory or pilot scale, also assist in evaluation of certain conditions and prediction of performance of the commercial process. These activities also provide information that can be used to model or simulate the commercial process. Computer-based or virtual simulations of certain unit operations or dynamics can provide process understanding and help avoid problems at commercial scale. It is important to understand the degree to which models represent the commercial process, including any differences that might exist, as this may have an impact on the relevance of information derived from the models.\n\nIt is essential that activities and studies resulting in process understanding be documented. Documentation should reflect the basis for decisions made about the process. For example, manufacturers should document the variables studied for a unit operation and the rationale for those variables identified as significant. This information is useful during the process qualification and continued process verification stages, including when the design is revised or the strategy for control is refined or changed.\n\nii.2.2 Establishing a Strategy for Process Control\n\nProcess knowledge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach to process control for each unit operation and the process overall. Strategies for process control can be designed to reduce input variation, adjust for input variation during manufacturing (and so reduce its impact on the output), or combine both approaches.\n\nProcess controls address variability to assure quality of the product. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points (SS 211.110(c)). Decisions regarding the type and extent of process controls can be aided by earlier risk assessments, then enhanced and improved as process experience is gained.\n\nFDA expects controls to include both examination of material quality and equipment monitoring. Special attention to control the process through operational limits and in-process monitoring is essential in two possible scenarios:\n\nWhen the product attribute is not readily measurable due to limitations of sampling or detectability (e.g., viral clearance or microbial contamination) or\n\nWhen intermediates and products cannot be highly characterized and well-defined quality attributes cannot be identified.\n\nThese controls are established in the master production and control records (see SS 211.186(a) and (b)(9)).\n\nMore advanced strategies, which may involve the use of process analytical technology (PAT), can include timely analysis and control loops to adjust the processing conditions so that the output remains constant. Manufacturing systems of this type can provide a higher degree of process control than non-PAT systems. In the case of a strategy using PAT, the approach to process qualification will differ from that used in other process designs. Further information on PAT processes can be found in FDA's guidance for industry on PAT -- A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance.14\n--------------------\nContext title: Process Validation- General Principles and Practices Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.341505289077759"], "Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance document\n\nGuidance for Industry: Interim Procedures for Qualified\n\nHealth Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food\n\nand Human Dietary Supplements\n\nJULY 2003\n\nDocket Number:\n\nFDA-2003-N-0103 (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2003-N-0103).\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-interim-procedures:\n\nqualified-health-claims-labeling-conventional-human-food-and)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFor questions regarding this draft document contact the Center for Food Safety and Applied\n\nNutrition (CFSAN) at 240-402-1450.\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

OBJECTIVE\n\nA. Criteria for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion\n\nB. Procedures\n\nFiling Review\n\nPrioritization\n\nOpportunity for Public Comment\n\nScientific Review\n\nConsolidation of Like Petitions\n\nConsultation with Other Federal Agencies\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nA Criteria for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion FDA plans to establish criteria for considering exercising enforcement discretion for qualified health claims based on the extent to which the totality of the publicly available evidence supports the claim (see Guidance for Industry and FDA: Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data). Different levels of evidence will result in different qualifying language as described in Table 1, which provides standardized language for the B, C, and D categories to be used as part of the qualifying language for qualified health claims until consumer research [3] is complete.\n\nProcedures\n\nFiling Review FDA plans to begin accepting petitions for qualified health claims on September 1, 2003. Within 45 days of receipt of a qualified health claim petition, FDA intends to determine whether the petition is complete (see Section C below). If the petition is incomplete, the agency plans to inform the petitioner of the deficiencies and what steps the petitioner should take to rectify these deficiencies. If FDA determines that the petition is complete, it intends to file the petition. The agency recognizes that it can evaluate petitions more efficiently and effectively if they are well-organized and contain all the relevant information. FDA encourages potential petitioners to meet with the agency prior to preparing a petition to discuss their plans.\n\nPrioritization\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline\nScientific Ranking & FDA & \\\nRanking & Category & Appropriate Qualifying Language*** \\ \\hline Second Level & B &... \u201calthough there is scientific evidence supporting the claim, the evidence is not conclusive.\u201d \\ \\hline Third Level & C & \u201cSome scientific evidence suggests... however, FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive.\u201d \\ \\hline Fourth Level & D & \u201cVery limited and preliminary scientific research suggests... FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim.\u201d \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nFrom Guidance for Industry and FDA: Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data.\n\n***The language reflects wording used in qualified health claims as to which the agency has previously exercised enforcement discretion for certain dietary supplements. During this interim period, the precise language as to which the agency considers exercising enforcement discretion may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Standardized Qualifying Language for Qualified Health Claims.\n\nFDA has only limited resources for reviewing health claims. Thus, to maximize the public health benefit of its claims review process, FDA intends to prioritize on a case-by-case basis all complete petitions according to several factors, including whether the food or dietary supplement that is the subject of the petition is likely to have a significant impact on a serious or life-threatening illness; the strength of the evidence; whether consumer research has been provided to show the claim is not misleading; whether the substance of the claim has undergone an FDA safety review (i.e., is an authorized food additive, has been GRAS (generally recognized as safe) affirmed, listed, or has received a letter of \"no objection\" to a GRAS notification); whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has been adequately characterized so that the relevance of available studies can be evaluated; whether the disease is defined and evaluated in accordance with generally accepted criteria established by a recognized body of qualified experts; and whether there is prior review of the evidence or the claim by a recognized body of qualified experts.\n3. Opportunity for Public Comment Upon filing of a petition, FDA intends to post the petition on its website and request public comment for 60 days. FDA plans to post comments submitted by the public on FDA's website or to make comments available for public review at the Division of Dockets Management, HFA-305.\n4. Scientific Review After the comment period closes, FDA may pursue any one of several options for scientific review of data submitted in a petition in support of the substance/disease relationship. For example, FDA may conduct the review internally, it may convene an advisory subcommittee, or it may use appropriate third-party reviewers under contract to FDA, e.g., the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ). In the case of a petition forwarded to AHRQ, AHRQ plans to send the petition to an Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC) with which it has a contract to review the scientific evidence in the petition and to rank the degree of scientific certainty of the validity of the substance/disease relationship. AHRQ also plans to ask the EPC to review those science-related public comments received by FDA that discuss or provide evidence. Within 120 days after the commencement of the third party review, FDA would expect to receive a report that includes a description of the evidence reviewed, an analysis of that evidence, a summary of and response to public comments that pertain to the evidence, and its assessment as to the degree of scientific certainty in support of the substance/disease relationship.\n5. Consolidation of Like Petitions_If FDA receives more than one petition for a qualified health claim that describes the same relationship between a substance and a disease or health-related condition during its review, the agency plans to consolidate all of the related petitions received, if appropriate.\n6. _Consultation with Other Federal Agencies To fully inform FDA's review, FDA intends, as appropriate, on a case-by-case-basis, to consult with other scientific Federal agencies with official responsibility for public health protection or research related to human nutrition and dietary supplements.\n7. Regulatory Decision As mentioned above, FDA plans to either conduct its own review or use an appropriate third party to conduct a scientific review. In the case of third party review, after FDA receives, for example the EPC report, FDA intends, based on the totality of the publicly available evidence, public comment, and other relevant regulatory considerations, to determine whether to consider exercising enforcement discretion with respect to the proposed claim. If FDA decides to consider exercising enforcement discretion, the agency plans to determine what qualifying statement(s) and other information should accompany the claim to ensure that it is truthful and not misleading. In reaching its determination, FDA intends to review and evaluate the third party report, the totality of the publicly available evidence, and all of the public comments submitted within the comment period, as well as consider how the proposed qualified claim will affect consumers' dietary choices. FDA also intends to consider whether to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to other requirements in 21 CFR 101.14, and what other factors, in addition to qualifying language, are relevant to considering the exercise of enforcement discretion.\n8. Notification to Petitioner On or before day 270 after receipt of the filed petition, FDA plans to notify the petitioner in a letter of: a) the agency's determination; b) the basis for its determination; and c) if the agency decides to consider exercising enforcement discretion, the qualified claim for which the agency intends to consider exercising such discretion and the provisions of 21 CFR 101.14 for which the agency intends to consider exercising such discretion. FDA also plans to notify the petitioner of any other factors the agency intends to consider in deciding whether to exercise enforcement discretion when the claim appears in labeling of conventional human food or dietary supplements. FDA plans to post the letter and any third party report on the agency's website.\n9. _Extensions_If the agency determines that it is appropriate, upon good cause, FDA may, decide to extend by 30-60 days the time period to notify the petitioner.\n\nReconsideration\n\nIf a petitioner or other party disagrees with an FDA determination, that party may request reconsideration. FDA intends to reconsider its determination if the party presents significant new relevant evidence or provides a persuasive analysis that the agency's interpretation of the original evidence was incorrect. FDA intends to use the same process described above for reconsideration of the agency's determination. FDA may, on its own initiative, decide to reconsider a determination.\n\nContent of Petitions\n\nRequirements\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7045996189117432", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance Document\n\nGuidance for Industry: FDA's Implementation of Qualified Health Claims\n\nMAY 2006\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-fda-implementation-qualified-health-claims)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nComments and suggestions regarding this document may be submitted at any time.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You may use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nBackground\n\nWhy is FDA providing for \"qualified\" health claims?\n\nThrough the Better Nutrition Information for Consumer Health Initiative (see Consumer Health Information for Better Nutrition Initiative (/food/labeling:\n\nnutrition/consumer-health-information-better-nutrition-initiative-task-force-final-report), issued July 10, 2003), FDA acknowledged that consumers benefit from more information on food labels concerning diet and health. As part of this initiative, the agency established interim procedures whereby \"qualified\" health claims can be made not only for dietary supplements but for conventional foods as well (see Interim\n\nProcedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food\n\nAn example of dietary guidance, which does not refer to a specific substance but rather refers to a broad class of foods without an expressed or implied connection to a specific substance that is present the class of foods is: \"Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer\". One element is present, but not both. It is not a health claim because it cannot reasonably be understood to be about a specific substance. A dietary guidance statement that refers to a specific food or food component but not a disease or health-related condition is: \"Carrots are good for your health, \" or \"Calcium is good for you.\" Again, one element is present, but not both.\n8. How is dietary guidance provided for on food labels? Truthful, non-misleading dietary guidance statements may be used on food labels, and do not undergo pre-review by FDA. However, once the food is marketed with the statement, FDA can consider whether the statement meets the requirement to be truthful and not misleading (see 21 CFR 101.14). FDA, as part of its recent Better Nutrition Information for Consumer Health Initiative, recognized that scientifically sound and non-misleading dietary guidance statements may be useful to consumers when placed on food labels.\n\nProcedures for Qualified Health Claims\n\nWhat are the regulatory procedures associated with qualified health claims? All health claims, whether SSA or qualified, require that a petition be submitted to FDA. The requirements for health claim petitions are specified in 21 CFR 101.70, and the general requirements for health claims are in 21 CFR 101.14. Both types of health claims can be applicable to conventional foods and dietary supplements, must characterize the substance's ability to reduce the risk of disease, and cannot be about mitigating or treating disease. Qualified health claims have differences that relate to scientific support, wording of the claim, use of enforcement discretion, and timelines.\n\nHow is the science supporting a qualified health claim different from that for an SSA health claim? SSA health claims require significant scientific agreement based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (see 21 CFR 101.14). Qualified health claims are still based on the totality of publicly available evidence but the scientific support does not have to be as strong as that for significant scientific agreement. Under its interim guidance (see Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04400072/044-0072-pdn0001-05-FDA-vol5.pdf)), FDA is tentatively providing for 3 levels of science below the SignificantScientific Agreement standard: good to moderate level of scientific agreement, low level of scientific agreement, and very low level of scientific agreement. The criteria for the scientific review are described in the interim guidance.\n\nHow the language for qualified health claims is different? Qualified health claims language must be worded (\"qualified\") in such a way that consumers are not misled about the nature of the supporting science. As part of its interim guidance (see Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04q0072/04q-0072-pdn0001-05-FDA-vol5.pdf)), FDA has specified qualifying language for the 3 levels of scientific support below the Significant Scientific Agreement standard. FDA also notes that it may consider other qualifying language on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHow do the regulatory procedures for qualified health claims differ from SSA health claims? Petitions requesting an SSA health claim are evaluated under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard (see Significant Scientific Agreement in the Review of Health Claims for Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements_ (http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/995424GD.pdf)). If FDA decides that standard is met, it authorizes the claim through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Petitions requesting a qualified health claim are posted on the FDA web page for a 60-day public comment period. Qualified health claims meeting the interim procedures criteria are provided for by letters of enforcement discretion (as described above). The letter of enforcement discretion will be posted on the FDA web page. Petitions for a qualified health claim that have no credible scientific evidence for the claim may be denied. These letters will be posted on FDA's website.\n\n*What is the procedural timeline for qualified health claims?\n\nWithin 15 days of receipt, FDA will acknowledge the petition.\n\nWithin 45 days of receipt, FDA will file the petition and a docket number will be assigned. Note: Petitions that do not meet content requirements as specified in 21 CFR 101.70 will not be filed and will be returned to the petitioner.\n\nAt the time of filing, FDA will post the petition on the FDA webpage for a 60-day public comment period. During this time, written comments may be submitted to the docket.\n\nOn or before 270 days after receipt of the petition, a final decision will be sent to the petitioner in the form of a letter as to whether FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to a qualified health claim or deny the petition. The letter will be posted on FDA's website.\n\nExtensions beyond 270 days can be granted upon mutual agreement between the petitioner and the agency.\n\nSubmitting a Petition\n\nHow will FDA know that I wish to have my petition reviewed under the standards for a qualified health claim rather than those for an SSA health claim (i.e., under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard)? The petitioner may indicate within the petition's cover letter that he/she is waiving the right to a review under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard and request that the petition be reviewed under the interim procedures for a qualified health claim. This request will result in FDA proceeding directly to the qualified health claim procedures and its 270-day timeline (see next question). In the absence of such a request, FDA contacts the petitioner to determine if they are petitioning for a SSA or qualified health claim.\n\nWhat information is required to be included in the petition? The requirements of 21 CFR 101.70 apply. A general summary of these requirements follows. 1. Preliminary Requirements (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)(A)) Explanation of how substance conforms to the requirements of CFR 101.14(b): * Relationship between substance and disease in U.S; * Substance contributes taste, aroma, nutritive value, or a technical effect listed in 21 CFR 170.3(0); * Substance is a food, food ingredient, or component that has been shown to be safe and lawful at levels necessary to justify a claim. 2.

These provisions are intended to expedite the process by which the scientific basis for such claims is established. Since the passage of FDAMA, FDA has been reviewing both the statute and the accompanying legislative history in order to determine the most appropriate approach for implementing these new provisions. Due to the speed with which the FDAMA provisions became effective, the agency has decided to issue this guidance document during the initial phase of implementing these new provisions. Submission procedures and use of a public docket for claims Notifications should be submitted in duplicate to Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740 or by email at label.claims@cfsan.fda.gov (mailto:label.claims@cfsan.fda.gov). The notification should be clearly marked as \"Notification for a Health Claim (or Nutrient Content Claim) Based on an Authoritative Statement.\" Whether notifications will be placed in a public docket upon receipt will be addressed in notice and comment rulemaking for an implementing regulation. When a notification is received, FDA intends to review whether the notification includes the information necessary for the claim to be authorized under sections 303 and 304 of FDAMA. This may include, for example, a review for the submission of all the required elements and the identification of an appropriate statement from an appropriate scientific body (as identified below). The agency intends to notify the submitter by letter as soon as possible within the 120 days after submission when the notification does not comply with sections 303 and 304. When a notification does not meet the requirements of sections 303 and 304, the use of the claim is not authorized under FDAMA. The submitter may choose to revise the notification and resubmit it, in which case a food could not be marketed with the claim until at least 120 days after resubmission. As provided by FDAMA, FDA also may act to prohibit or modify a claim by regulation or a United States district court may find that the requirements of section 303 or 304 of FDAMA have not been met. Scientific body FDAMA permits claims based on current, published authoritative statements from \"a scientific body of the United States with official responsibility for public health protection or research directly related to human nutrition... or the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or any of its subdivisions.\" The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are federal government agencies specifically identified as scientific bodies by FDAMA. FDA believes that other federal agencies may also qualify as appropriate sources for such authoritative statements. Along with NAS (or any of its subdivisions), the agency currently considers that the following federal scientific bodies may be sources of authoritative statements: the CDC, the NIH, and the Surgeon General within Department of Health and Human Services; and the Food and Nutrition Service, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Agricultural Research Service within the Department of Agriculture.\n\nAuthoritative statement FDA also believes it is necessary to clarify what constitutes an authoritative statement under FDAMA. FDAMA itself states that an authoritative statement: (1) is \"about the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-related condition\" for a health claim, or \"identifies the nutrient level to which the claim refers\" for a nutrient content claim, (2) is \"published by the scientific body\" (as identified above), (3) is \"currently in effect,\" and (4) \"shall not include a statement of an employee of the scientific body made in the individual capacity of the employee.\"\n\nIn addition, given the legislative history of sections 303 and 304 of FDAMA, FDA currently believes authoritative statements also should: (5) reflect a consensus within the identified scientific body if published by a subdivision of one of the Federal scientific bodies, and (6) be based on a deliberative review by the scientific body of the scientific evidence.\n\nNot all pronouncements by the designated scientific bodies would meet these criteria. For example, authoritative statements by the Surgeon General would normally be found only in the Surgeon General Reports.\n\nFDA intends to consult, as appropriate, with the scientific body that is the source of a statement cited as the basis for a claim, as well as with the other federal scientific bodies that have public health responsibilities and expertise relative to the claim. The agency has already begun this liaison process.\n\nScientific standard with respect to health claims FDAMA upholds the \"significant scientific agreement\" standard for health claims. This conclusion is based on FDAMA and its legislative history. FDAMA provides that FDA may issue a regulation under section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the Act to prohibit or modify a claim. Section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) permits FDA to promulgate regulations authorizing health claims only if FDA \"determines, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.\"\n\nConsistent with this provision, FDA intends to determine whether the standard of significant scientific agreement is met by a health claim based on an authoritative statement. And consistent with earlier regulations, FDA does not believe this standard would allow for a claim based on, for example, findings characterized as preliminary results, statements that indicate research is inconclusive, or statements intended to guide future research.\n\nFDATA requires that a person must submit a notification of the claim at least 120 days before the first introduction into interstate commerce of the food with a label containing the claim. FDA notes that, as indicated by FDAMA, the notification is to include: (1) \"the exact words used in the claim,\" (2) \"a concise description of the basis upon which such person relied for determining that the requirements\" for an authoritative statement \"have been satisfied,\" (3) \"a copy of the statement referred to...upon which such person relied in making the claim,\" and (4) for a health claim, \"a balanced representation of the scientific literature relating to the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-related condition to which the claim refers,\" or, for a nutrient content claim, \"a balanced representation of the scientific literature relating to the nutrient level to which the claim refers.\"\n\nFDA expects that to provide a \"balanced representation of the scientific literature,\" a bibliography of the scientific literature on the topic of the claim would be compiled. A brief, balanced account or analysis of how this literature either supports or fails to support the authoritative statement should be submitted.\n\nFDAMA imposes several additional conditions on claims based on authoritative statements and the foods for which such claims are made. For example, FDAMA requires that such a claim be \"stated in a manner so that the claim is an accurate representation of the authoritative statement referred to\" and \"so that the claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided in the claim and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of a total daily diet.\"\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Notification of a Health Claim or Nutrient Content Claim Based on an Authoritative Statement of a Scientific Body \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.487669467926025", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: GUIDANCE DOCUMENT\n\nGuidance for Industry: Evidence-Based Review System for the Scientific Evaluation of Health Claims\n\nJANUARY 2009\n\nFinal\n\nDocket Number:\n\nEhA.2007.0-0371 (https://www.megulations.gov/docket/FDA-2007-0371)\n\nIssued by:\n\n(Iregulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-evidence-based-review-system-scientific-evaluation-health-claims)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

It represents the agency's current thinking on 1) the process for evaluating the scientific evidence for a health claim, 2) the meaning of the significant scientific agreement (SSA) standard in section 403(7)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (z1 U.S.C. 343(r)(3)) and 21 CFR 101.14(c), and 3) credible scientific evidence to support a qualified health claim.\n\nThis guidance document describes the evidence-based review system that FDA intends to use to evaluate the publicly available scientific evidence for SSA health claims or qualified health claims on the relationship between a substance and a disease or health-related condition. (2) This guidance document explains the agency's current thinking on the scientific review approach FDA should use and is intended to provide guidance to health claim petitioners. (3)\n\nThe specific topics addressed in this guidance document are: (1) identifying studies that evaluate the substance/disease relationship, (2) identifying surrogate endpoints for disease risk, (3) evaluating the human studies to determine whether scientific conclusions can be drawn from them about the substance/disease relationship, (4) assessing the methodological quality of each human study from which scientific conclusions about the substance/disease relationship can be drawn, (5) evaluating the totality of scientific evidence, (6) assessing significant scientific agreement, (7) specificity of claim language for qualified health claims, and (8) reevaluation of existing SSA or qualified health claims.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency's guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nBack to top:\n\nThe Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) (Pub. L. 101-553) was designed to give consumers more scientifically valid information about foods they eat. Among other provisions, the NLEA directed FDA to issue regulations providing for the use of statements that describe the relationship between a substance and a disease (\"health claims\") in the labeling of foods, including dietary supplements, after such statements have been reviewed and authorized by FDA. (4) For these health claims, that is, statements about substance/disease relationships, FDA has defined the term \"substance\" by regulation as a specific food or food component (21 CFR 101.14(a)(2)). An authorized health claim be used on both conventional foods and dietary supplements, provided that the substance in the product and the product itself meet the appropriate standards in the authorizing regulation. Health claims are directed to the general population or designated subgroups (e.g., the elderly) and are intended to assist the consumer in maintaining healthful dietary practices.\n\nIn evaluating a petition for an authorized health claim, FDA considers whether the evidence supporting the relationship that is the subject of the claim meets the SSA standard. This standard derives from 21 U.S.C. 343 (r)(J)(J)(B)(J), which provides that FDA shall authorize a health claim to be used on conventional foods if the agency \"determines based on the totality of the publicly available evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.\" This scientific standard was prescribed by statute for conventional food health claims; by regulation, FDA adopted the same standard for dietary supplement health claims. See 21 CFR 101.14(c).\n\nThe genesis of qualified health claims was the court of appeals decision in Pearson v. Shadala (Pearson). In that case, the plaintiffs challenged FDA's decision not to authorize health claims for four specific substance-disease relationships in the labeling of dietary supplements. Although the district court ruled for FDA (14 F. Supp. 2d to (D.D.C. 1998), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the lower court's decision (164 F.3d 650 (D.C. Cir.1999)). The appeals court held that the First Amendment does not permit FDA to reject health claims that the agency determines to be potentially misleading unless the agency also reasonably determines that a disclaimer would not eliminate the potential deception. The appeals court also held that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) required FDA to clarify the \"significant scientific agreement\" (SSA) standard for authorizing health claims.\n\nOn December 22, 1999, FDA announced the issuance of its Guidance for Industry: Significant Scientific-Agreement in the Review of Health Claims for Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements (64 Fed. Reg.17494). This guidance document was issued to clarify FDA's interpretation of the SSA standard in response to the court of appeals' second holding in Pearson.\n\nOn December 20, 2002, the agency announced its intention to extend its approach to implementing the Pearson decision to include health claims for conventional foods (67 Fed. Reg. 78002). Recognizing the need for a scientific framework for qualified health claims, the Task Force on \"Consumer Health Information for Better Nutrition\" was formed. The Task Force recognized that there could be significant public health benefits when consumers have access to, and use, more and better information in conventional food as well as dietary supplement labeling to aid them in their purchases, information that goes beyond just price, convenience, and taste, but extends to include science-based health factors. Armed with more scientifically based information about the likely health benefits of the foods and dietary supplements they purchase, consumers can make a tangible difference in their own long-term health by lowering their risk of numerous chronic diseases.\n\nTo maximize the public health benefit of FDA's claims review process, the Task Force's Final Report(r) provides a procedure to prioritize on a case-by-case basis all complete petitions according to several factors, including whether the food or dietary supplement that is the subject of the petition is likely to have a significant impact on a serious or life-threatening illness; the strength of the evidence; whether consumer research has been provided to show the claim is not misleading, whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has undergone an FDA safety review (i.e., is an authorized food additive, has been Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) affirmed, listed, or has received a letter of \"no objection\" to a GRAS notification); whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has been adequately characterized so that the relevance of available studies can be evaluated; whether the disease is defined and evaluated in accordance with generally accepted criteria established by a recognized body of qualified experts; and whether there has been prior review of the evidence or the claim by a recognized body of qualified experts.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Evidence-Based Review System for the Scientific Evaluation of Health Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.981795787811279", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUse of the Term \"Healthy\" in the Labeling of Human Food Products: Guidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from: Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling Nutrition Program Staff, HFS-830 Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Food and Drug Administration 5001 Campus Drive College Park, MD 20740 (Tel) 240-402 -1450 http://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to advise manufacturers who wish to use the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\" to label their food products as provided by our regulations. More specifically, this guidance is intended to advise food manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion relative to foods that use the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\" on their labels which: (1) Are not low in total fat, but have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats; or (2) contain at least ten percent of the Daily Value (DV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC) of potassium or vitamin D.\n\nThis guidance is immediately effective because the agency has determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate (21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nUnder section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(A)), a food2 is misbranded if it bears claims, either express or implied, that characterize the level of a nutrient which is of a type required to be declared in nutritionlabeling3 unless the claim is made in accordance with a regulatory definition established by FDA (see section 403(r)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 343(r)(2)). 21 CFR 101.65(d) provides such regulatory definition for use of the term \"healthy\" or related terms (such as \"health,\" \"healthful,\" \"healthfully,\" \"healthfulness,\" \"health,\" \"healthiest,\" \"healthily,\" and \"healthiness\") as an implied nutrient content claim on the label or in labeling of a food. The \"healthy\" nutrient content claim can be used if the food meets certain nutrient conditions; and, when used with an explicit or implicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g. \"healthy, contains 3 grams of fat\"), suggests that a food, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in creating a diet that is consistent with dietary recommendations. The nutrient conditions for bearing a \"healthy\" nutrient content claim include specific criteria for nutrients to limit in the diet, such as total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, as well as requirements for nutrients to encourage in the diet, including vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, protein, and fiber. The criteria are linked to elements in the Nutrition Facts label and serving size regulations (see 21 CFR SSS 101.9 and 101.12). The nutrient criteria to use the claim can vary for different food categories (e.g., fruits and vegetables, or seafood and game meat) (see 21 CFR 101.65(d)(2)).\n\nFootnote 3: Section 201(m) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(m)) defines \u201clabeling\u201d as all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers or accompanying such article.\n\nIn addition, it is also important to note that under section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)), a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) provides that labeling is misleading if, among other things, it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued final rules updating the Nutrition Facts label and serving size information for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease (see 81 FR 33742, \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\"; 81 FR 34000, \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments\"). Updates to the Nutrition Facts label include changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes to the Daily Value (DV) of other individual nutrients, reflecting changes in recommended intake levels, based on current science. The individual nutrients included in Nutrition Facts and their DVs significantly influence the regulations on nutrient content and health claims. Because the framework for many of FDA's other nutrition labeling regulations is linked to elements in the Nutrition Facts label and serving size regulations, we plan to update those other regulations, such as those for health claims and nutrient content claims (including the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\"), to align with these most recent updates.\n\nWe are re-evaluating the regulatory criteria for use of the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\" in light of the latest nutrition science and the current dietary recommendations and seek input on possible future rulemaking to update the existing regulations for this claim. Because the rulemaking process can sometimes be lengthy, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion in the interim with respect to some of the existing criteria for the nutrient content claim \"healthy\" if the alternative nutrient criteria described below are met. We intend to exercise enforcement discretion until we amend 21 CFR 101.65(d)(2).\n\nLow Fat\n\nAs stated above, since we published the final rule defining \"healthy\" (58 FR 2302, January 6, 1993), the science related to public health recommendations for intake of dietary fats has evolved. The focus of the most recent dietary fat recommendations has shifted away from limiting total fat intake to encouraging intakes of mono and polyunsaturated fats. Foods that use the term \"healthy\" on their labels that are not low in total fat should have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats (i.e., sum of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are greater than the total saturated fat content of food). Consistent with consensus science and public health recommendations for dietary fats which no longer recommend low total fat intake, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the current requirement that any food bearing the nutrient content claim \"healthy\" meet the low fat requirement (SS101.65(d)(2)(i)), provided that: (1) The amounts of mono and polyunsaturated fats are declared on the label and (2) the amounts declared constitute the majority of the fat content. These conditions are necessary so that consumers are made aware that the total fat is mostly made up of fats that are encouraged by current dietary recommendations.\n\nBeneficial Nutrients\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Use of the Term \u201cHealthy\u201d in the Labeling of Human Food Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.446859359741211", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 232 / Wednesday, December 3, 1997 / Notices 64093\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nIndustry-Supported Scientific and Educational Activities\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Policy\n\nNovember 1997\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nIndustry-Supported Scientific and Educational Activities\n\nI. Background: Promotion, Education, and Independence\n\nTwo important sources of information on therapeutic products (human and animal drugs, biological products, and medical devices regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) for health care professionals are: (1) Activities (programs and materials) performed by, or on behalf of, the companies that market the products; and (2) activities, supported by companies, that are otherwise independent from the promotional influence of the supporting company. Although both provide valuable and sometimes vital information to health care professionals, the programs and materials performed and disseminated by companies are subject to the labeling and advertising provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), whereas the truly independent and nonpromotional industry-supported activities have not been subject to FDA regulation.2\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by FDA\u2019s Intra-Agency Working Group on Advertising and Promotion. This guidance represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on industry-supported scientific and educational activities. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the industry. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nFootnote 2: In this context, the terms \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cnonpromotional\u201d are not mutually exclusive. The agency views independence as an indication of whether an activity is nonpromotional.\n\nThis jurisdictional line is important because the constraints on advertising and labeling,3 when applied to scientific and educational activities, can restrict the freedom of participants to discuss their data or express their views. In particular, discussions of unapproved uses, which can be an important component of scientific and educational activities, are not permissible in programs that are or can be (because the provider is not functionally independent) subject to substantive influence by companies that market products related to the discussion. Thus, the agency, has traditionally sought to avoid regulating activities that are producedindependently from the influence of companies marketing the products. The agency recognizes that industry-supported activities can be both nonpromotional and educational.\n\nDemarcating the line between activities that are performed by or on behalf of the company, and thus, subject to regulation, and activities that are essentially independent of their influence has become more difficult due to the increasing role industry has played in supporting postgraduate and continuing education for health care professionals.\n\nThe agency traditionally has recognized the important public policy reasons not to regulate all industry-supported activities as advertising or labeling. To permit industry support for the full exchange of views in scientific and educational discussions, including discussions of unapproved uses, FDA has distinguished between those activities supported by companies that are nonpromotional and otherwise independent from the substantive influence of the supporting company and those that are not. Those activities that have been deemed by the agency to be independent from influence by the supporting company and nonpromotional have not been treated as advertising or labeling, and have not been subjected to the agency's regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIn determining whether an activity is independent of the substantive influence of a company, the agency examines whether and to what extent the company is in a position to influence the presentation of information related to its products or otherwise transform an ostensibly independent program into a promotional vehicle. FDA is concerned that companies may influence the content of educational programs both directly and indirectly. Directly, by being involved in the selection of speakers or in the treatment of topics. Indirectly, through the nature of the relationship between the company and the provider (e.g., if the provider has reason to believe that future financial support from the company depends upon producing programs that promote the company's products.)\n\nFDA is responsible for seeing that scientific and educational activities that are not intended to be promotional are designed to be truly independent from substantive influence by the marketers of regulated products. The agency recognizes, however, that the primary responsibility for overseeing the process of postgraduate and continuing professional education and scientific exchange lies with the scientific and health care communities and accrediting organizations. Accordingly, FDA will work closely with scientific and professional health care communities and accrediting organizations to help ensure that provider activities are independent.\n\nThe agency is providing this guidance to describe the agency's enforcement policy with regard to scientific and educational activities supported by industry. The guidance seeks to clarify the distinction drawn by the agency between scientific and educational activities that FDA considers nonpromotional and those that the agency considers promotional, and to provide guidance on how industry may support such activities without subjection to regulation under the labeling and advertising provisions of the act.\n\nThis guidance applies only to those company-supported activities that relate to the supporting company's products or to competing products. A company-supported educational activity or part thereof that does not relate to the company's products or a competing product, or suggest a use for the company's products, would not be considered a promotional activity under this guidance.\n\nII. Guidance: Industry-Supported Scientific and Educational Activities\n\nFDA has not regulated and does not intend to regulate, under the labeling and advertising provisions of the act, industry-supported scientific and educational activities that are independent of the influence of the supporting company. Companies and providers who wish to ensure that their activities will not be subject to regulation should design and carry out their activities free from the supporting company's influence and bias, based on the factors considered in evaluating activities and determining independence, as described below. These factors are provided to furnish guidance on the design and conduct of such activities, so that they will be educational and nonpromotional in nature. These factors will be considered as part of an overall evaluation of an activity; no individual factor is likely by itself to stimulate an action based on lack of independence.\n\nA. Factors Considered in Evaluating Activities and Determining Independence\n\nFDA will consider the following factors in evaluating programs and activities and determining independence:(1) Control of Content and Selection of Presenters and Moderators\n\nThe agency will consider whether the provider has maintained full control over the content of the program, planning of the program's content, and over the selection of speakers and moderators. In so doing, the agency will look at whether the supporting company has engaged in scripting, targeting points for emphasis, or other actions designed to influence the program's content. In addition, the agency will consider if the company has suggested speakers who are or were actively involved in promoting the company's products or who have been the subject of complaints or objections with regard to presentations that were viewed as misleading or biased in favor of the company's products.\n\n(2) Disclosures\n\nThe agency will consider whether there was meaningful disclosure, at the time of the program, to the audience of: (1) The company's funding of the program; (2) any significant relationship between the provider, presenters or moderators, and the supporting company (e.g., employee, grant recipient, owner of significant interest or stock); and (3) whether any unapproved uses of products will be discussed;\n\n(3) The Focus of the Program\n\nThe agency will consider whether the intent of the company and the provider is to produce an independent and nonprorotional activity that is focussed on educational content and free from commercial influence or bias. The agency will also consider whether the title of the activity fairly and accurately represents the scope of the presentation.\n\nThe agency also will look at the focus of the activity to determine if the central theme is based on a single product marketed by the company or a competing product, except when existing treatment options are so limited as to preclude any meaningful discussion of alternative therapies. This is not to suggest that each treatment option must be discussed with precisely equal emphasis. However, emphasis on a newer or, in the view of the presenter, more beneficial treatment modality should be provided in the context of a discussion of all reasonable and relevant options.\n\n(4) Relationship Between Provider and Supporting Company\n\nThe agency will consider whether there are legal, business, or other relationships between the company and the provider that could place the company in a position whereby it may exert influence over the content of the activity (e.g., a provider that is owned by, or is not viable without the support of, the company supporting the activity).\n\n(5) Provider Involvement in Sales or Marketing\n--------------------\nContext title: Industry Supported Scientific and Educational Activities Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.4746880531311035"], "Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: The BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nAn exclusivity period for the first biological product determined to be interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use, during which a second or subsequent biological product may not be determined interchangeable with that reference product (see section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act)\n\nProcedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(l) of the PHS Act)\n\nTransition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously would have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below:\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class4 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010. Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term \u201cproduct class\u201d for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term \u201creference product\u201d means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)\") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\" provision\n\nFDA's Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s draft guidance for industry The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.891510486602783", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: B.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n\nThe FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA).\n\nFootnote 12: See also footnote 10 in the response to Q2.\n\nFDA issues only one U.S. license number per BLA holder, regardless of the number of licensed biological products manufactured by that BLA holder under separate BLAs. Accordingly, if an NDA holder is also a BLA holder and has been assigned a U.S. license number for another biological product, the NDA holder will not be issued a different U.S. license number when its approved NDA for a biological product is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 351(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHS Act requires that each package of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, the applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. To minimize possible disruption in the distribution of biological products in the United States and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA intends to adopt a compliance policy for the labeling of biological products that are the subject of deemed BLAs (see Q14 and section IV below for additional information on the compliance policy for labeling of biological products in deemed BLAs).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision, along with the applicable provisions of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, to mean that an approved NDA, including an application submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (505(b)(2) application), will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020, and does not explicitly state whether an approved NDA will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA. The Agency's interpretation that an approved NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA is based on the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency). We expect that the measures FDA has taken to minimize differences in the review and approval of products in marketing applications submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will facilitate implementation of the statutory provision under which an approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA.\n\nThe Agency's interpretation that an approved 505(b)(2) application will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA reflects the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency).13 This approach also reflects the Agency's view that it is more appropriate to regulate a biological product approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway that may be intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different strength, dosage form, or route of administration or approved conditions of use) from a previously approved product under the statutory and regulatory framework for 351(a) BLAs, as such differences are not permitted under the statutory framework for 351(k) BLAs. Moreover, FDA's approval of a 505(b)(2) application reflects the Agency's evaluation of the data against a different statutory standard than a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing be deemed to be a BLA?*\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) states that an \"approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]\" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed.\n\nHow will the transition on March 23, 2020, affect the annual program fee for an approved NDA for a biological product?\n\nUnder section 736(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person named as the applicant in a human drug application (which refers to an NDA or a 351(a) BLA, subject to applicable statutory exceptions) is assessed an annual prescription drug program fee. A prescription drug program fee is assessed each fiscal year for each prescription drug product identified in a human drug application approved as of October 1 of the fiscal year, with certain exceptions described by statute. For more information about the prescription drug program fee, consult the FDA guidance for industry Assessing User Fees Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (May 2018).\n\nIn general, sponsors of biological products for which annual prescription drug program fees are assessed prior to the transition, and that are deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date, will continue to be assessed prescription drug program fees for such products after the transition, subject to applicable statutory requirements and exceptions.\n\nIf an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved on or before the transition date, or otherwise pending with FDA, and submits an application for the same product under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, will an additional PDUFA application fee be assessed?\n\nAn applicant (or the applicant's licensee, assignee, or successor) will not be charged a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee for the submission of an application under section 351(a) of the PHS Act if all of the following circumstances are satisfied (see section 736(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe applicant previously submitted an NDA for the same product and paid the associated PDUFA application fee for the NDA.\n\nThe NDA was accepted for filing. (Note that an NDA for a biological product will not be accepted for filing after the transition date.)\n\nThe NDA was not approved14 or was withdrawn (without a waiver). Footnote 14: An NDA that is tentatively approved is notan approved NDA (see 21 CFR 314.105(a)).\n\nFor questions regarding user fees, please contact the User Fee Staff at\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.6544365882873535", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA's draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.9985766410827637", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n\nExamples of biological products approved under the FD&C Act are listed in the Appendix to the Transition Policy Final Guidance. To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA's electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from \"NDA\" to \"BLA\") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA's Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA's preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA's website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA's draft guidance for industry Implementation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended definition of \"biological product\" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.641688346862793", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Chapter 1 Labeling for Biosimilar Products\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJuly 2018\n\nLabeling\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help applicants develop draft labeling for proposed biosimilar products for submission in an application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262(k)). The recommendations for prescription drug labeling in this guidance pertain only to the prescribing information (commonly referred to as the package insert), except for certain recommendations in section V pertaining to FDA-approved patient labeling (e.g., Patient Information, Medication Guide, and Instructions for Use).2 This guidance does not provide specific labeling recommendations for interchangeable products (see section VIII of this guidance).\n\nFootnote 2: Unless otherwise specified, the terms biosimilar product labeling and labeling as used in this guidance address only the prescribing information as described in 21 CFR 201.56 and 201.57.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Public Law 111-148) on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act amends the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated license pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference product3 (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the Affordable Care Act). Section 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product.\n\nFootnote 3: Reference product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSection 351(i) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean \"that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\"\n\nTo meet the standard for interchangeability, an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from:\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nUnder the PHS Act, FDA has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.\n\nUnder FDA regulations, prescription drug labeling must provide adequate information to enable health care providers to \"use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended\"; and to this end, the approved prescribing information summarizes the essential scientific information needed by health care providers for the safe and effective use of a drug.4 Prescription drug labeling reflects FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness5({}^{,})6 for the drug under the labeled conditions of use and facilitates prescribing decisions, thereby enabling the safe and effective use of drugs, including biological products, and reducing the likelihood of medication errors.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2647894620895386", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6147273778915405"], "Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical?

A definition of \"custom synthesised chemical\" was not provided in ICH Q11, but a custom synthesised chemical is generally understood to be one that is made specifically to a drug substance manufacturer's requirement, either in-house or externally, or available for purchase but where the only use is for pharmaceutical manufacture. The reference to \"non-pharmaceutical market\" in the ICH Q11 description of commercially available chemicals is intended to preclude purchased intermediates from being claimed as commercially available chemicals.\n\n[1]ICH Q11 makes an important distinction between commercially available chemicals and custom synthesised chemicals. An applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material, whereas a custom synthesised chemical proposed as a starting material should be justified in accordance with the ICH Q11 general principles. The availability of a chemical from multiple suppliers should not be the sole basis for the designation of a chemical as a commercially available starting material. This includes situations where a custom synthesized chemical has become available over time from multiple suppliers. Such chemicals should still be justified according to the ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials. It can be acceptable for a starting material that is demonstrated to be a commercially available chemical to enter late in the synthesis, e.g., in the last chemical transformation prior to the drug substance. A chemical manufactured on a small scale can be suitable as a commercially available starting material, provided that the scale is sufficient for the manufacture of the drug substance and that the chemical is also used in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market. In some cases, a chemical that does not meet the definition of a commercially available chemical (e.g., it does not have a non-pharmaceutical use) but is simple enough in structure may be accepted as a starting material (e.g., protected natural amino acids). However, in such cases, a rationale should be provided explaining why the starting material is considered appropriate (see Q&A 5.1) and why the proposed control strategy is appropriate to control impurities in the drug substance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.246997356414795", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: 5.2.1 Justification of Starting Material Selection for Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nThe applicant should provide a justification for how each proposed starting material is appropriate in light of the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1. This can include information on:\n\nThe ability of analytical procedures to detect impurities in the starting material;\n\nThe fate and purge of those impurities and their derivatives in subsequent processing steps;\n\nHow the proposed specification for each starting material will contribute to the control strategy.\n\nThe applicant should provide, as part of the justification, a flow diagram outlining the current synthetic route(s) for the manufacture of the drug substance, with the proposed starting materials clearly indicated. Changes to the starting material specification and to the synthetic route from the starting material to final drug substance are subject to regional, post-approval change requirements. In addition, regional requirements concerning starting material suppliers may also be applicable.\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material. A commercially available chemical is usually one that is sold as a commodity in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market in addition to its proposed use as starting material. Chemicals produced by custom syntheses are not considered to be commercially available. If a chemical from a custom synthesis is proposed as a starting material, it should be justified in accordance with the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1.\n\nIn some instances, additional purification steps by the drug substance manufacturer might be called for to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material. In these instances, the additional purification steps should be included as part of the description of the drug substance manufacturing process. Specifications should normally be provided for both incoming and purified starting material.\n\n5.2.2 Justification of Starting Material Selection for Semi-Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nIf an isolated intermediate is proposed as the starting material for a semi-synthetic drug substance, the applicant should provide a justification that explains how the proposed starting material complies with the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1. Otherwise, the applicant should describe the manufacturing process starting from the microorganism or botanical material, as appropriate, and these materials should be qualified.\n\n5.2.3 Qualification of Source or Starting Materials for Biotechnological/Biological Drug Substances\n\nGuidance is contained in ICH Q5A, Q5B and Q5D.\n\n6 Control Strategy\n\nGeneral Principles\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.058812141418457", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: 5 SELECTION OF STARTING MATERIALS AND SOURCE MATERIALS\n\n[5.4] Do the ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials and apply to processes where multiple chemical and multiple chemical transformations are performed. The ICH Q11 general principles apply to processes where multiple chemical transformations are performed without isolation of intermediates. In the absence of such isolations (e.g., crystallization, or starting materials and precipitation), design of the manufacturing process (e.g., kinetics) and/or unit operations (e.g., extraction, distillation, the use of scavenging agents) should be in place to adequately control and/or purge impurities and be described in the application.\n\n[5.5] ICH Q11 states that \"A starting material is incorporated as a significant structural fragment\" has frequently been misinterpreted as significant structural fragment into the structure of the drug substance.\" Why then are intermediates used are intermediates used for a very late intermediate as the starting material. A proposed starting material may be defined downstream from a commercially available chemical, provided that there are multiple chemical transformation steps between the proposed starting material and the drug substance, and provided the justification addresses the ICH Q11 general principles. The presence of a \"significant structural fragment\" should not be the sole basis for starting material selection.

A definition of \"custom synthesised chemical\" was not provided in ICH Q11, but a custom synthesised chemical is generally understood to be one that is made specifically to a drug substance manufacturer's requirement, either in-house or externally, or available for purchase but where the only use is for pharmaceutical manufacture. The reference to \"non-pharmaceutical market\" in the ICH Q11 description of commercially available chemicals is intended to preclude purchased intermediates from being claimed as commercially available chemicals.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.602261066436768", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical?

The ICH Q11 general principles apply to processes where multiple chemical transformations are performed without isolation of intermediates. In the absence of such isolations (e.g., crystallization, or starting materials and precipitation), design of the manufacturing process (e.g., kinetics) and/or unit operations (e.g., extraction, distillation, the use of scavenging agents) should be in place to adequately control and/or purge impurities and be described in the application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.5297892093658447", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: No. The ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials do not include a recommendation that all steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities should be included in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2. Similarly, the general principles do not include a recommendation that all steps that establish regio- or stereochemical configurations (which can therefore result in regio- or stereoisomerism) should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2. However, it is expected that the other ICH Q11 general principles on impurities (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) and inclusion of enough of the manufacturing process (see Q&A 5.11) be applied when deciding whether steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish regio- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included. As an example, a mutagenic compound could be introduced prior to the starting material, or be the starting material itself, provided the ICH Q11 general principles are addressed.\n\nQ11. ICH Q11 states that \"enough of the drug substance manufacturing process should be described in the application...\" What considerations should an applicant apply in the selection of the proposed starting materials to assure that enough of the drug substance manufacturing process will be described in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application? (5.11)\n\nIn deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application, the following considerations should be applied.\n\nThe applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\nNext, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n\nThey need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThey include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n\nAfter these considerations, if the evaluation would result in only a small number of chemical transformation steps, then it is generally appropriate to include one or more additional chemical transformation steps in section 3.2.S.2.2. This is to ensure that enough steps are conducted under GMP to appropriately mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material. The following paragraphs provide further clarification on this risk mitigation and should be considered together.\n\nAlthough ICH Q11 does not specify how many steps should be performed under GMP, ICH Q11 recommends the inclusion of \"multiple chemical transformation steps\" in section 3.2.S.2.2 in order to reduce the risk of contamination and support the effective implementation of the control strategy throughout the product lifecycle. When there would be a small number of steps, there is an increased risk of contamination that needs to be addressed by the applicant in their starting material justification, and will often be best mitigated by including one or more additional steps in section 3.2.S.2.\n\nPotential risks from future changes to the starting material synthesis should also be considered (see Q&A 5.16). There is an increased risk that impurities generated as a result of a change to the manufacturing process upstream of the starting material may not be detected or purged appropriately if the starting material is only a small number of steps from the drug substance. In order to determine how many additional steps to include, the applicant may also consider other approaches to risk mitigation; for example, inclusion of analytical methodologies in the specification of the proposed starting material that are designed to detect a wide range of possible impurities based on different physical and chemical separation and detection principles. Appropriate acceptance criteria for unspecified impurities should be included in the specification.\n\nThe applicant should include in their justification of the proposed starting material a comprehensive description as to what factors were considered in deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is provided in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application to ensure that risks are appropriately mitigated.\n\nWhat considerations are important for a starting material specification? (5.12)\n\nApplicants should provide and justify a specification (which includes a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria) for all proposed starting materials as part of the drug substance control strategy.\n\nThe specification of a starting material should include tests for identity and purity (e.g., controls on impurities) and, where applicable, could include acceptance criteria for assay, specified, unspecified and total impurities, residual solvents, reagents, elemental impurities and mutagenic impurities. The analytical procedures used should be suitably validated. The tests and acceptance criteria should be based on process knowledge and the drug substance control strategy. The justification of the specification should include an evaluation of the risks and the ability of the subsequent steps to adequately control and/or purge impurities.\n\nFor starting materials that are not commercially available chemicals, what information should be provided on the synthetic route? (5.13)\n\nInformation on how the proposed starting material is made (e.g., a flow chart of the starting material manufacturing process, showing all reagents, catalysts and solvents used) should be provided to help justify the controls applied to the starting material. Information about the actual and potential impurities in the proposed starting material should be provided.\n\nWhat information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material (see ICH Q11 section 5.2.1). However, the applicant should provide basic information on the starting material (chemical name, chemical formula, and molecular weight), information on the impurity profile of the starting material, and how the control strategy for the drug substance manufacturing process justifies the starting material specification.\n\nIf the drug substance manufacturer needs to perform additional purification steps to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material, ICH Q11 also recommends that these steps should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 as part of the drug substance manufacturing process.\n\nThe applicant should set appropriate controls and should justify the proposed specification for the actual and potential impurities that are reasonably expected in a proposed starting material, based on the scientific knowledge and available information.\n\nICH M7 states: \"For starting materials that are introduced late in the synthesis of the drug substance (and where the synthetic route of the starting material is known) the final steps of the starting material synthesis should be evaluated for potential mutagenic impurities.\" In the case where the starting material is a commercially available chemical, then this evaluation would be used to determine the appropriate control strategy.\n\nFor all starting materials, applicants should set appropriate controls and be able to justify the proposed specifications.\n\nCan the Life cycle Management section of ICH Q11 (section 9) apply to starting materials? (5.15)\n\nYes. In addition to what is submitted in the application, changes upstream of the defined starting material should be managed under the applicant's Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS), which should address residual risks to the drug substance quality.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe Lifecycle Management section of ICH Q11 reinforces management's responsibility described in Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10), which is applicable to starting material lifecycle management. ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) recommends that\n\nThe pharmaceutical quality system, including the management responsibilities described in this section, extends to the control and review of any outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials. The pharmaceutical company is ultimately responsible to ensure processes are in place to assure the control of outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials.\n\nICH Q7 sections 7 (Materials Management) and 13 (Change Control), ICH Q7 Q&A document sections 7 and 13, as well as ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) provide guidance that can be applied to the management of starting materials and starting material suppliers.\n\nICH Q9 and its Annexes provide guidance on the use of principles for quality risk management which can be applied to changes related to the starting materials (e.g., new starting material suppliers, manufacturing processes, or specifications).\n\nQ16. Does ICH Q11 include specific guidance for post-approval changes to steps upstream of the starting material (e.g., changes in synthetic route, reagents, solvents, starting material supplier)? (5.16)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances--Questions and Answers (Chemical Entities and Biotechnological:Biological Entities) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.3376967906951904", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: Q5. ICH Q11 states \"A starting material is incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the drug substance.\" Why then are intermediates used late in the synthesis, which clearly contain significant structural fragments, often not acceptable as starting materials? (5.5)\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nIn some cases, a chemical that does not meet the definition of a commercially available chemical (e.g., it does not have a non-pharmaceutical use) but is simple enough in structure may be accepted as a starting material (e.g., protected natural amino acids). However, in such cases, a rationale should be provided explaining why the starting material is considered appropriate (see Q&A 5.1) and why the proposed control strategy is appropriate to control impurities in the drug substance.\n\nQ7.: Q11 recommends that \"manufacturing steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance should normally be included in the manufacturing process described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application.\" At what level would a related substance or mutagenic impurity be considered to impact the impurity profile of the drug substance? (5.7)\n\nFor non-mutagenic related substances, the ICH Q3A identification threshold serves to identify the level above which a related substance is considered to have an impact on the impurity profile of the drug substance. A related substance with an acceptance criterion above the ICH Q3A identification threshold is considered to impact the drug substance impurity profile.\n\nFor mutagenic impurities, the 30 percent threshold of the ICH M7 acceptable limit serves to identify the level above which a mutagenic impurity is considered to have an impact on the impurity profile of the drug substance. In this situation, the control strategy will generally include a test for the impurity at the acceptable limit (see section 8 of ICH M7). Any of the approaches described in section 8 of ICH M7 can be used to determine which impurities are likely to be present in the drug substance above the 30 percent threshold.\n\nIn line with ICH M7 and ICH S9, there are situations (e.g., when the drug substance is itself genotoxic, and other circumstances as described in these guidances) when the selection of the starting material for a drug substance does not need to specifically consider the mutagenic impurity profile at the levels described above. In such cases, mutagenic impurities are not considered to impact the impurity profile of the drug substance unless they are above the ICH Q3A identification threshold. Impurities that persist through multiple steps of the manufacturing process should be considered in conjunction with Q&A 5.8.\n\nQ8.: What is meant by impurities that \"persist\" in ICH Q11 Example 4? (5.8)\n\nICH Q11 recommends that \"manufacturing steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance should normally be included in the manufacturing process described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application.\" However, as described in ICH Q11 Example 4, this principle does not necessarily apply when impurities originate early and \"persist\" across multiple steps to the drug substance. It is normally expected that the justification for an impurity that persists will be based on it being carried across one or more manufacturing steps upstream of the proposed starting material, when these steps do not otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance (for \"impact,\" see Q&A 5.7).\n\nIn Example 4, an impurity in Compound B impacts the impurity profile of the drug substance. Steps 2 and 3 (from Compound B to Compound D) do not introduce other impurities that impact the drug substance impurity profile. If impurities generated in Steps 2 or 3 do impact the drug substance impurity profile, these steps should also be considered for inclusion in 3.2.S.2.2 of the application.\n\nImpurities that persist may or may not react in subsequent steps, but are not removed to the extent that they would no longer be considered to impact the drug substance impurity profile. For example, an impurity that persists might have physico-chemical properties (e.g., solubility) similar to other intermediates or the drug substance, like the enantiomer in Example 4, which could make its removal intrinsically difficult.\n\nICH Q11 Example 4 illustrates that when the synthetic route contains an impurity that persists, it can be acceptable to control the impurity in the starting material specification even though it impacts the impurity profile of the drug substance. Therefore, it is not always necessary to include steps that form such an impurity in section 3.2.S.2.2, provided that the other ICH Q11 general principles are addressed (ICH Q11 section 5.1.1). Example 4 is not exclusive to stereoisomers and can be applied to other types of impurities that persist.\n\nIn Example 4, there are 3 chemical transformation steps between the starting material D and the drug substance. The 3 steps in Example 4 are not intended to imply that 3 chemical transformation steps are considered enough (see Q&A 5.11) in all cases, nor that 3 chemical transformation steps are mandatory.\n\nIn the case of Example 4, application of the ICH Q11 principles includes control of the enantiomer in the specification of the proposed starting material D, in combination with the understanding that the steps immediately prior to D do not introduce other impurities that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. The applicant should provide information in the application on the upstream process to justify the proposed starting material including control strategy of the impurity that persists.\n\nIn Example 4, there are 3 chemical transformation steps between the starting material D and the drug substance. The 3 steps in Example 4 are not intended to imply that 3 chemical transformation steps are considered enough (see Q&A 5.11) in all cases, nor that 3 chemical transformation steps are mandatory.\n\nIn the case of Example 4, application of the ICH Q11 principles includes control of the enantiomer in the specification of the proposed starting material D, in combination with the understanding that the steps immediately prior to D do not introduce other impurities that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. The applicant should provide information in the application on the upstream process to justify the proposed starting material including control strategy of the impurity that persists.\n\nIn the case of Example 4, application of the ICH Q11 principles includes control of the enantiomer in the specification of the proposed starting material D, in combination with the understanding that the steps immediately prior to D do not introduce other impurities that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. The applicant should provide information in the application on the upstream process to justify the proposed starting material including control strategy of the impurity that persists.\n\nQ9. What should an applicant consider when determining which manufacturing steps impact the mutagenic impurity profile of the drug substance, as part of the selection and justification of starting materials? (5.9)\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]\n\nto justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n\nQ10. Do all steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish regio- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application? (5.10)\n\nNo. The ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials do not include a recommendation that all steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities should be included in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2. Similarly, the general principles do not include a recommendation that all steps that establish regio- or stereochemical configurations (which can therefore result in regio- or stereoisomerism) should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2. However, it is expected that the other ICH Q11 general principles on impurities (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) and inclusion of enough of the manufacturing process (see Q&A 5.11) be applied when deciding whether steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish regio- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included. As an example, a mutagenic compound could be introduced prior to the starting material, or be the starting material itself, provided the ICH Q11 general principles are addressed.\n\nQ11. ICH Q11 states that \"enough of the drug substance manufacturing process should be described in the application...\" What considerations should an applicant apply in the selection of the proposed starting materials to assure that enough of the drug substance manufacturing process will be described in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application? (5.11)\n\nIn deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application, the following considerations should be applied.\n\nThe applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\nNext, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances--Questions and Answers (Chemical Entities and Biotechnological:Biological Entities) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.3322741985321045"], "As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: OOS results or significant atypical trends should be investigated.

This summary should be subjected to periodic review.\n\n3. Glossary\n\nThe definitions provided below apply to the words and phrases used in these guidelines. Although an effort has been made to use standard definitions as far as possible, they may have different meanings in other contexts and documents. The following definitions are provided to facilitate interpretation of the guidelines. The definitions are consistent with those published in other WHO quality assurance guidelines. The Quality Assurance of Medicines Terminology Database was established in August 2005 and includes the definitions of terms related to quality assurance of medicines. This database is intended to help harmonize terminology and to avoid misunderstandings that may result from the different terms and their interpretations used in various WHO publications. The main publications used as a source of information to create the Quality Assurance of Medicines Terminology Database are the quality assurance guidelines included in the thirty-sixth and subsequent reports of the WHO Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations.\n\naccelerated testing. Studies designed to increase the rate of chemical degradation and physical change of an active pharmaceutical ingredient or finished pharmaceutical product by using exaggerated storage conditions as part of the stability testing programme. The data thus obtained, in addition to those derived from long-term stability studies, may be used to assess longer-term chemical effects under non-accelerated conditions and to evaluate the impact of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions, as might occur during shipping. The results of accelerated testing studies are not always predictive of physical changes.\n\nactive pharmaceutical ingredient. Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical dosage form and that, when so used, becomes an active ingredient of that pharmaceutical dosage form. Such substances are intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure and function of the body.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.2102580070495605", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: method-dependent. For the purpose of stability testing, tests for purity should focus on methods for determination of degradation products.\n\nThe degree of purity, as well as the individual and total amounts of degradation products of the biotechnological/biological product entered into the stability studies, should be reported and documented whenever possible. Limits of acceptable degradation should be derived from the analytical profiles of batches of the drug substance and drug product used in the preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nThe use of relevant physicochemical, biochemical, and immunochemical analytical methodologies should permit a comprehensive characterization of the drug substance and/or drug product (e.g., molecular size, charge, hydrophobicity) and the accurate detection of degradation changes that may result from deamidation, oxidation, sulfoxidation, aggregation, or fragmentation during storage. As examples, methods that may contribute to this include electrophoresis (SDS09Page, immunoelectrophoresis, Western blot, isoelectrofocusing), high-resolution chromatography (e.g., reversed-phase chromatography, gel filtration, ion exchange, affinity chromatography), and peptide mapping.\n\nWherever significant qualitative or quantitative changes indicative of degradation product formation are detected during long-term, accelerated, and/or stress stability studies, consideration should be given to potential hazards and to the need for characterization and quantification of degradation products within the long-term stability program. Acceptable limits should be proposed and justified, taking into account the levels observed in material used in preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nFor substances that cannot be properly characterized or products for which an exact analysis of the purity cannot be determined through routine analytical methods, the applicant should propose and justify alternative testing procedures.\n\nOther Product Characteristics (5.4)\n\nThe following product characteristics, though not specifically relating to biotechnological/biological products, should be monitored and reported for the drug product in its final container:\n\nVisual appearance of the product (color and opacity for solutions/suspensions; color, texture, and dissolution time for powders), visible particulates in solutions or after the reconstitution of powders or lyophilized cakes, pH, and moisture level of powders and lyophilized products.\n\nSterility testing or alternatives (e.g., container/closure integrity testing) should be performed at a minimum initially and at the end of the proposed shelf life.\n\nAdditives (e.g., stabilizers, preservatives) or excipients may degrade during the dating period of the drug product. If there is any indication during preliminary stability studies that reaction or degradation of such materials adversely affect the quality of the drug product, these items may need to be monitored during the stability program.\n\nThe container/closure has the potential to affect the product adversely and should be carefully evaluated (see below).\n\nVI.: Storage CONDITIONS (6)\n\nA. Temperature (6.1)\n\nBecause most finished biotechnological/biological products need precisely defined storage temperatures, the storage conditions for the real-time/real-temperature stability studies may be confined to the proposed storage temperature.\n\nB. Humidity (6.2)\n\nBiotechnological/biological products are generally distributed in containers protecting them against humidity. Therefore, where it can be demonstrated that the proposed containers (and conditions of storage) afford sufficient protection against high and low humidity, stability tests at different relative humidities can usually be omitted. Where humidity-protecting containers are not used, appropriate stability data should be provided.\n\nC. Accelerated and Stress Conditions (6.3)\n\nAs previously noted, the expiration dating should be based on real-time/real-temperature data. However, it is strongly suggested that studies be conducted on the drug substance and drug product under accelerated and stress conditions. Studies under accelerated conditions may provide useful support data for establishing the expiration date, provide product stability information or future product development (e.g., preliminary assessment of proposed manufacturing changes such as change in formulation, scale-up), assist in validation of analytical methods for the stability program, or generate information that may help elucidate the degradation profile of the drug substance or drug product. Studies under stress conditions may be useful in determining whether accidental exposures to conditions other than those proposed (e.g., during transportation) are deleterious to the product and also for evaluating which specific test parameters may be the best indicators of product stability. Studies of the exposure of the drug substance or drug product to extreme conditions may help to reveal patterns of degradation; if so, such changes should be monitored under proposed storage conditions. Although the tripartite guideline on stability describes the conditions of the accelerated and stress study, the applicant should note that those conditions may not be appropriate for biotechnological/biological products. Conditions should be carefully selected on a case-by-case basis.\n\nD. Light (6.4)\n\nApplicants should consult the appropriate regulatory authorities on a case-by-case basis to determine guidance for testing.\n\nE. Container/Closure (6.5)\n\nChanges in the quality of the product may occur due to the interactions between the formulated biotechnological/biological product and container/closure. Where the lack of interactions cannot be excluded in liquid products (other than sealed ampules), stability studies should include samples maintained in the inverted or horizontal position (i.e., in contact with the closure), as well as in the upright position, to determine the effects of the closure on product quality. Data should be supplied for all different container/closure combinations that will be marketed.\n\nIn addition to the standard data necessary for a conventional single-use vial, the applicant should demonstrate that the closure used with a multiple-dose vial is capable of withstanding the conditions of repeated insertions and withdrawals so that the product retains its full potency, purity, and quality for the maximum period specified in the instructions-for-use on containers, packages, and/or package inserts. Such labeling should be in accordance with relevant national/regional requirements.\n\nF. Stability after Reconstitution of Freeze-Dried Product (6.6)\n\nThe stability of freeze-dried products after their reconstitution should be demonstrated for the conditions and the maximum storage period specified on containers, packages, and/or package inserts. Such labeling should be in accordance with relevant national/regional requirements.\n\nVII Testing Frequency (7)\n\nThe shelf lives of biotechnological/biological products may vary from days to several years. Thus, it is difficult to draft uniform guidelines regarding the stability study duration and testing frequency that would be applicable to all types of biotechnological/biological products. With only a few exceptions, however, the shelf lives for existing products and potential future products will be within the range of 0.5 to 5 years. Therefore, the guidance is based upon expected shelf lives in that range. This takes into account the fact that degradation of biotechnological/biological products may not be governed by the same factors during different intervals of a long storage period.\n\nWhen shelf lives of 1 year or less are proposed, the real-time stability studies should be conducted monthly for the first 3 months and at 3 month intervals thereafter. For products with proposed shelf lives of greater than 1 year, the studies should be conducted every 3 months during the first year of storage, every 6 months during the second year, and annually thereafter.\n\nWhile the testing intervals listed above may be appropriate in the preapproval or prelicense stage, reduced testing may be appropriate after approval or licensure where data are available that demonstrate adequate stability. Where data exist that indicate the stability of a product is not compromised, the applicant is encouraged to submit a protocol that supports elimination of specific test intervals (e.g., 9-month testing) for postapproval/postlicensure, long-term studies.\n\nVIII Specifications (8)\n\nAlthough biotechnological/biological products may be subject to significant losses of activity, physicochemical changes, or degradation during storage, international and national regulations have provided little guidance with respect to distinct release and end of shelf life specifications. Recommendations for maximum acceptable losses of activity, limits for physicochemical changes, or degradation during the proposed shelf life have not been developed for individual types or groups of biotechnological/biological products but are considered on a case-by-case basis. Each product should retain its specifications within established limits for safety, purity, and potency throughout its proposed shelf life. These specifications and limits should be derived from all available information using the appropriate statistical methods. The use of different specifications for release and expiration should be supported by sufficient data to demonstrate that the clinical performance is not affected, as discussed in the tripartite guideline on stability.\n\nLabeling (9)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5C Quality of Biotechnological Products- Stability Testing of Biotechnological:Biological Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6256744265556335", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: Stability testing for certain drug products and components\n\nPeriodic examinations of data and of reserve samples\n\nIf the demand for MNPs cannot be met by the measures described above, manufacturers can consider reducing activities that are more directly connected with batch manufacturing or a product accept/reject decision provided that they have a documented rationale or risk assessment to show that the proposed changes will not unacceptably reduce assurance of product quality. Examples include:\n\nNot requiring second-person verification of activities for less critical steps (though we recommend a self-check of work)\n\nReducing the number of samples for labor-intensive laboratory testing\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nForgoing an in-process test to assure adequacy of mix, particularly when making successive batches, where the risk is judged to be low in terms of drug safety and efficacy\n\nDelaying completion of deviation investigations of minor events\n\nCDER recommends that in taking such measures, firms plan to carefully monitor indicators of product quality to note any unfavorable trends or shifts as a result of the implementation of the Plan. CDER also recommends that firms retain samples for testing at a later date in cases where testing is reduced or omitted because of lack of resources.\n\nReturning to Normal Operations\n\nA critical component of any emergency Plan is a procedure detailing when and how the transition back to pre-emergency, or normal, operations should occur. Once the Plan has been activated, it should remain active continuously until there is a reasonable expectation that normal operations will be maintainable for an extended period of time. The Plan should consider:\n\nWhat factors will indicate that it is time to return to normal operations or deactivate the Plan\n\nWhat resources will be necessary to complete postponed activities\n\nWhat activities will enable a successful transition back to normal operations\n\nThe following questions can stimulate some useful ideas for consideration and inclusion in the Plan:\n\nWhat information should be used to signal a return to normal operations (e.g., percentage of absenteeism in critical manufacturing and/or laboratory positions has remained below X percent for Y number of consecutive days)?\n\nHow should efforts to resume processes suspended during the emergency be prioritized?\n\nWhat is the most efficient method to address delayed activities such as sample analysis and equipment calibrations?\n\nHow should issues resulting from the execution of the Plan (e.g., out of specification test results, deviations, unusual complaints) be reported to CDER?\n\nWhat mechanism is most appropriate to review and summarize activities taken during Plan activation?\n\nCDER encourages companies to maintain awareness of the emergency on the local, national, and global scale as much as possible. This awareness will help the company anticipate potential future concerns or imminent hazards that could affect their decision to resume normal operations or continue operating under their Plan. CDER also recommends that firms conduct a formal post-execution assessment of the execution outcomes and update their Plan as appropriate.\n\nNotifying CDER\n\nIt is probable that despite every effort to avoid shortages, the very nature of an emergency makes shortages of products possible or even likely. To foster communication between companies and CDER and protect the national public health, we encourage manufacturers to include a procedure in their Plan for notifying CDER when the Plan is activated and when returning to normaloperations. These communications are intended to help CDER maintain awareness of any potential shortage situations and act accordingly to avoid or mitigate them. During periods when manufacturers are experiencing high rates of absenteeism, it is possible that CDER will also experience staff shortages. In such circumstances, CDER's ability to confirm receipt or subsequent activities could be delayed. We suggest that notifications of this nature include the following information, and be sent to CDERStaffingNotice@FDA.HHS.GOV:\n\nWithin 1 day of Plan activation:\n\nManufacturing facilities affected\n\nDate the Plan is implemented at each affected facility\n\nContact information for site-responsible person\n\nCompany-identified criteria that have triggered activation of the Plan\n\nProducts to be manufactured under the altered procedures of the Plan (include NDA, ANDA, and BLA numbers)\n\nProducts to have manufacturing temporarily delayed (include NDA, ANDA, BLA numbers)\n\nAny anticipated or potential shortages\n\nQuantity of finished product on hand for any product with an anticipated or potential shortage\n\nWithin 1 day of the Plan deactivation:\n\nManufacturing facilities affected\n\nDate the Plan was implemented at each affected facility\n\nDate each affected facility returned to normal operations\n\nContact information for site-responsible person\n\nIf, after releasing a MNP under the Plan, a firm obtains information leading to suspicion that the product might be defective, the firm should contact CDER immediately in adherence to existing recall reporting regulations (21 CFR 7.40) or defect reporting requirements for drug application products (21 CFR 314.81(b)) and therapeutic biological products regulated by CDER (21 CFR 600.14).\n\nDocumenting Emergency Activities\n\nCDER recommends that manufacturers evaluate changes to be made in accordance with the execution of the Plan and manage those changes having the potential to affect product quality in accordance with the CGMP requirements. Records that support decisions to carry out changes to approved procedures for manufacturing and release of products under the Plan should be retained at the site in accordance with the CGMP requirements (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180). Records FDA expects to be available include but are not limited to the following:\n\nAny supporting documentation for the Plan, including risk assessments and management approval for any change to an approved procedure or activity (e.g., delaying, substituting, or reducing the frequency of an approved procedure or activity)\n\nLot numbers and application numbers of each product manufactured under the Plan\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnalytical data and relevant records for all products manufactured under an unapproved or nonstandard process, including the outcomes of delayed activities that are part of approved procedures or requirements for batch release (e.g., results from delayed specification tests)\n\nTimeline for completion of delayed or substituted activities that are part of the approved application or standard operating procedures, such as sample analysis and equipment calibrations and outcomes\n\nIf these records were to be reviewed during an inspection, FDA will consider the prevailing circumstances and the rationale used by a manufacturer to justify any observed discrepancies or deviations from a manufacturer's standard operating procedures and approved application(s).\n\nIV Optimization and Demonstration of Preparedness\n\nThe optimization of an emergency plan can be an iterative process that involves drafting, reviewing, testing, and revising the Plan, perhaps more than once. Optimization can involve progressing from a simple discussion-based \"table top\" event toward a more elaborate simulation demonstrating the capability of the Plan. To derive the most benefit from this process, any tests should strive to simulate anticipated emergency conditions as closely as possible and should be conducted in a no-fault environment with the goal to improve the plan and not place blame for mistakes or oversights.\n\nEach company should determine the most appropriate approach to ensure preparedness for execution of the Plan. CDER recommends that manufacturers conduct practice drills before an emergency appears imminent to increase familiarity of personnel at all levels with the Plan and their responsibilities under the Plan. CDER recommends considering the following activities, if feasible and practical:\n\nPracticing activation and deactivation of the Plan, involving all levels and roles within the company\n\nHaving fully trained employees observe cross-trained employees during an exercise and provide immediate constructive feedback\n\nCarrying out contingency analytical procedures in conjunction with standard procedures\n\nAny observations or outcomes resulting from these activities should be used to optimize the Plan and minimize any potential safety or product quality concerns. These corrections are typically best addressed through a formal meeting process following the exercise.\n\nV Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 72 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

The collections of information in 21 CFR 7.40 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0249; the collections of information in 21 CFR part 211 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0139; the collections of information in 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1) have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0001; the collections of information in 21 CFR 600.14 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0458.\n--------------------\nContext title: Planning for the Effects of High Absenteeism to Ensure Availability of Medically Necessary Drug Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8284348249435425", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.1.3 Selection of Batches (2.1.3)\n\nData from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the drug substance. The batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route as production batches and using a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on formal stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nii.1.4 Container Closure System (2.1.4)\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the drug substance packaged in a container closure system that is the same as or simulates the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\nii.1.5 Specification (2.1.5)\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, is addressed in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances and Q6B__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Biotechnological/Biological Products. In addition, specification for degradation products in a drug substance is discussed in ICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances.\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed should depend on the results from validation studies.\n\nTesting Frequency (2.1.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug substance. For drug substances with a proposed retest period of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed retest period.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that the results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nStorage Conditions (2.1.7)\n\nIn general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug substances are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug substance is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) or (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}).\n\n** If (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) and significant change occurs at any time during 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. Testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all tests, unless otherwise justified. The initial application should include a minimum of 6 months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\nSignificant change for a drug substance is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\nData from refrigerated storage should be assessed according to the evaluation section of this guidance, except where explicitly noted below.\n\nIf significant change occurs between 3 and 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the real time data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\nIf significant change occurs within the first 3 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling). This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the drug substance for a period shorter than 3 months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test a drug substance through 6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.\n\nFor drug substances intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period should be based on the real time data obtained at the long-term storage condition. In the absence of an accelerated storage condition for drug substances intended to be stored in a freezer, testing on a single batch at an elevated temperature (e.g., (5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) or (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})) for an appropriate time period should be conducted to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling).\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) (2.1.7.4)\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) should be treated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8 Stability Commitment (2.1.8)\n\nWhen available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed retest period granted at the time of approval, a commitment should be made to continue the stability studies postapproval to firmly establish the retest period.\n\nWhere the submission includes long-term stability data on three production batches covering the proposed retest period, a postapproval commitment is considered unnecessary. Otherwise, one of the following commitments should be made:\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period and to place additional production batches, to a total of at least three, on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission does not include stability data on production batches, a commitment should be made to place the first three production batches on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nThe stability protocol used for long-term studies for the stability commitment should be the same as that for the primary batches, unless otherwise scientifically justified.\n\n9.1.9 Evaluation (2.1.9)\n\nThe purpose of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance and evaluating the stability information (including, as appropriate, results of the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the drug substance manufactured under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification throughout the assigned retest period.\n\nThe data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under these circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis; providing a justification for the omission should be sufficient.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.2048784494400024", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: A report on changes in impurities with a description of analytical procedures\n\nData on three consecutive batches made at the new site\n\nHistorical data for comparison\n\nA description of the source of the historical data.\n\nA summary of validation data should be provided for any new analytical procedures and also for existing procedures if their use is being extended beyond their original purpose.\n\nIf equivalence of the impurity profile is established at any intermediate following the change, no testing of the drug substance is necessary.\n\nIf testing is performed on the drug substance, equivalence should be established for (1) the impurity profile and (2) the physical properties, if relevant to the finished dosage form performance. If either the impurity profile or physical properties are not equivalent in the drug substance, applicants still wishing to make the change should submit a prior approval supplement. When equivalence is not established, applicants should consider conducting an assessment of the effect of the change on the safety and effectiveness of the drug product (e.g., qualification of impurities, bioequivalence studies). The additional data that should be submitted will depend on the individual case, and the appropriate chemistry teams can be contacted for guidance.\n\nReporting Category:\n\nAnnual Report if the site change does not involve the final intermediate\n\nSupplement :Changes Being Effected if the site change involves the final intermediate\n\nScale Changes Scale changes include increases and decreases in the batch size of intermediates, including the final intermediate, beyond those approved in the original application. No attempt is made to classify scale changes according to the magnitude of the change. Scale changes need not be submitted to the Agency.\n\nEquipment Changes A change to new equipment need not be submitted to the Agency, even where equipment is specified in the approved application.\n\nAppendix B Specification Changes\n\nSpecification changes for release of an intermediate for further processing, raw materials (e.g., solvents and reagents), and starting materials are covered in this section. Changes to controls of critical steps (e.g., tests for monitoring reaction progress or for control of reaction events) are also covered in this section. Changes to operating conditions are covered under Manufacturing Changes (section V.C).\n\nSpecification changes for the final intermediate are not included in this guidance, nor are certain specification changes for raw materials, starting materials, and intermediates derived from natural sources or biotechnology (see section I).\n\n1. Specification Changes Made to Comply with Compendial Changes\n\nTest documentation (submitted in amendments to master files and/or in annual reports to the applications, as appropriate) should include:\n\nA description of the change\n\nUpdated specifications Reporting Category:\n\nAnnual Report.\n\nSpecification Changes That Provide Greater Assurance of Quality Examples:* Tightening of acceptance criteria\n\nReplacing an existing analytical procedure with an improved procedure\n\nRevised specifications associated exclusively with improved analytical procedures\n\nTest documentation (submitted as amendments to master files and/or in annual reports to the applications, as appropriate) should include:\n\nRationale for the proposed change and a brief description of any new analytical procedures, including a discussion of improvements over existing procedures.\n\nUpdated specifications.\n\nReporting Category:\n\nAnnual Report.\n\n3.3.3 Other Specification Changes\n\nExamples:\n\nRelaxing acceptance criteria\n\nDeleting a test\n\nReplacing an existing analytical procedure with a new procedure that does not qualify as an improvement\n\nRevised specifications associated with changes in supplier/grade of starting materials, reagents, or solvents\n\nGenerally, if there is a specification change that falls under this category, the effect of the change on the impurity profile of a later intermediate or on the impurity profile and/or physical properties of the drug substance should be evaluated. For example, if the stereochemistry at a position in an intermediate is induced through the use of a chiral reagent, a change in the acceptance criterion for the enantiomeric purity of the reagent from NLT 95% to NLT 90% should be evaluated. The evaluation should be conducted using material that challenges the specification change. For example, if an assay acceptance criterion for a starting material has been relaxed from a 98-102% range to a 90-102% range, the equivalence of an intermediate or drug substance should be demonstrated for batches made using starting material with an assay value near the new lower limit (i.e., 90%).\n\nSome specification changes that fall within the scope of section V.B.3 would clearly not affect the quality of downstream intermediates or the drug substance and therefore no evaluation of equivalence would be needed. Examples include:\n\nElimination of a redundant test (e.g., deletion of a boiling point test for a solvent where a chromatographic assay test is routinely performed)* Elimination of a test that is no longer necessary (e.g., testing for an impurity that is no longer present due to a change in the supplier of a starting material)\n\nInconsequential quality changes (e.g., change in the concentration of a reagent which would subsequently be diluted prior to use)\n\nThe common factor in these examples is that the ability to assess the chemical purity of the material is not being negatively altered by the change. Evaluation is not needed for such changes.\n\nTest documentation (submitted as amendments to master files and/or in annual reports or supplements to the applications, as appropriate) should include\n\nRationale for the proposed change and a brief description of any new analytical procedures\n\nEvaluation of the impurity profile and physical properties, if appropriate (see above). This evaluation should include:\n\nA report on changes in impurities with a description of analytical procedures\n\nData on three consecutive batches made using material that justifies the revised specifications\n\nHistorical data for comparison\n\nA description of the source of the historical data\n\nA summary of validation data should be provided for any new analytical procedures and also for existing procedures if their use is being extended beyond their original purpose.\n\nIf equivalence of the impurity profile is established at any intermediate following the change, no testing of the drug substance is necessary.\n\nIf testing is performed on the drug substance, equivalence should be established for (1) the impurity profile and (2) the physical properties, if relevant to the finished dosage form performance. If either the impurity profile or physical properties are not equivalent in the drug substance, applicants still wishing to make the change should submit a prior approval supplement. When equivalence is not established, applicants should consider conducting an assessment of the effect of the change on the safety and effectiveness of the drug product (e.g., qualification of impurities, bioequivalence studies). The additional data that should be submitted will depend on the individual case, and the appropriate chemistry teams can be contacted for guidance.\n\nRationale for not providing an evaluation of equivalence, if applicable\n\nCertificates of Analysis for raw materials and batch release data for intermediates, as appropriate Updated specifications\n\nReporting Category:\n\nAnnual Report if an evaluation of the effect of the change on impurity profile and/or physical properties is not necessary\n\nSupplement: Changes Being Effected if the effect of the change on impurity profile and/or physical properties should be demonstrated\n\nManufacturing Process Changes\n\nThis category encompasses a wide range of process-related changes. New specifications may be called for when different solvents, reagents, starting materials, or intermediates are involved (see also section V.B, Specification Changes). Process changes that result in the formation of a different final intermediate are outside the scope of this guidance. Also, certain process changes for raw materials, starting materials, and intermediates derived from natural sources or biotechnology are not included in this guidance (see section I).\n\n1.1.1 Changes That Do Not Involve New Starting Materials14 or Intermediates\n\nExamples include the following types of changes that might be made in one or more steps of the synthetic process, purification processes, or reprocessing operations:\n\nFootnote 14: Changes in a supplier of starting materials need not be submitted to the Agency except for those situations described in section I or when a firm has made a commitment to the Agency to do so.\n\nChanges in unit operations (e.g., addition, deletion, change in the order, repetition of an existing unit operation on a routine basis)\n\nAddition or deletion of raw materials (e.g., solvents, reagents) or ancillary materials (e.g., resins, processing aids)\n\nChanges in solvent composition (other than for an analytical procedure, which would be covered under Specification Changes)\n\nOperating conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, reagent stoichiometry, time)15 Footnote 15: Changes to operating conditions that are scale- or equipment-related or are within established or validated ranges need not be reported.\n\n1.2 Documentation of equivalence is recommended for most, but not all, cases. For example, if the amount of charcoal used in a process is increased, equivalence testing may not be warranted. However, if the amount of charcoal is decreased, there is the possibility of an increase in impurities; therefore, equivalence testing should be performed. If applicants/DMF holders have questions on whether equivalence testing should be conducted to support a change, the appropriate chemistry review teams can be consulted.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #126 BACPAC I-Intermediates in Drug Substance Synthesis Bulk Actives Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.2202504873275757", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: Evaluation of the impurity profile and physical properties.

Tests and acceptance criteria should be established, as appropriate. See section IV.A for additional guidance on evaluating equivalence when new residual solvents are present in an intermediate or the drug substance.\n\nIf testing is performed on the drug substance, equivalence should be established for (1) the impurity profile and (2) the physical properties, if relevant to the finished dosage form performance. If either the impurity profile or physical properties are not equivalent in the drug substance, applicants still wishing to make the change should submit a prior approval supplement. When equivalence is not established, applicants should consider conducting an assessment of the effect of the change on the safety and effectiveness of the drug product (e.g., qualification of impurities, bioequivalence studies). The additional data that should be submitted will depend on the individual case, and the appropriate chemistry teams can be contacted for guidance.\n* Certificates of Analysis from the suppliers for the proposed starting material. Reporting Category:\n* Supplement: Changes Being Effected in 30 Days.\n\nMultiple Changes\n\nMultiple changes are those that involve various combinations of the changes described in sections V.A, B, and C. The test documentation should be the sum of the recommendations for individual changes and the reporting category should be the most restrictive. For example, a change in the route of synthesis where equivalence is demonstrated at the final intermediate (prior approval supplement) and change in the manufacturing site of the final intermediate (Supplement: Changes Being Effected) should be submitted as a prior approval supplement, and the applicant should provide the listed test documentation for both changes.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]\n\nAttachment B Glossary\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\nNumerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the test described.\n\nAssess the Effects of the Change:\n\nTo evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product.\n\nBatch:\n\nA specific quantity of an intermediate or drug substance intended to have uniform character and quality, within specified limits, and produced according to a single manufacturing order during the same cycle of manufacture. A batch can also mean a specific quantity of material or drug substance produced in one process or series of processes so that it could be expected to be homogeneous (21 CFR 210.3(b)(2)).\n\nDrug Product:\n\nA finished dosage form (e.g., tablet, capsule, or solution) that contains a drug substance generally, but not necessarily, in association with one or more other ingredients (21 CFR 314.3(b)(4)).\n\nDrug Substance:\n\nAn active ingredient that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the human body, but does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of such ingredient (21 CFR 314.3(b)).\n\nFinal Intermediate:\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance, the last compound synthesized before the reaction that produces the drug substance. The final step forming the new drug substance involves covalent bond formation; ionic bond formation (i.e., making the salt of a compound) does not qualify. Consequently, when the drug substance is a salt, the precursors to the organic acid or base, rather than the acid or base itself, should be considered the final intermediate.\n\nFinal Solution Step:\n\nThe solution from which the drug substance is isolated in pure form by either crystallization or precipitation. Where the purification procedure for the crude drug substance involves several crystallization or precipitation steps, final solution step refers only to the last of these steps.\n\nHistorical Data:\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, data on impurities or physical attributes from three or more consecutive representative premodification batches. The upper statistical limit of an impurity should be based on the mean plus three times the standard deviation. A lower statistical limit can be similarly defined, where appropriate (e.g., the level of an active component, moisture content in a hydrate).\n\nImpurity:\n\nAny component of the drug substance that is not the entity defined as the drug substance.\n\nImpurity profile:\n\nA description of the identified and unidentified impurities present in a drug substance.\n\nIn Situ Intermediate: An intermediate that is not isolated. It is normally, but not necessarily, in solution (see the CDER guidance on Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances, February 1987).\n\nIntermediate: A material produced during steps of the synthesis of a drug substance that undergoes further molecular change before it becomes a drug substance.\n\nIsolated Intermediate: An intermediate that is obtained as the product after workup of a reaction step in the synthetic scheme for the drug substance. The isolation or purification procedure should be part of the validated process.

What is an \"ingredient\"?\n\nThe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act uses the term \"ingredient\" to refer to the compounds used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement. For instance, when calcium carbonate is used to provide calcium, calcium carbonate is an \"ingredient\" and calcium is a \"dietary ingredient.\" The term \"ingredient\" also refers to substances such as binders, colors, excipients, fillers, flavors, and sweeteners.\n\nPublic Law 103-417, 60 Federal Register 67194 at 67199 (December 28, 1995)\n\n2. What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?Top 0Ingredients that are sources of dietary ingredients may be listed within the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, e.g., \"Calcium (as calcium carbonate).\" When ingredients are listed in this way, they do not have to be listed again in the ingredient statement (also called an ingredient list).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(d)\n\nDo I need an ingredient statement when all of my ingredients are listed in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nNo. If you place all source ingredients in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel and you have no other ingredients, such as excipients or fillers, you do not need an ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nHow must I identify the ingredient list?\n\nYou must precede the ingredient list by the word \"Ingredients,\" except that you must use the words \"Other Ingredients\" when you have identified some ingredients (i.e., as sources) within the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhere must I place the ingredient list on the label?\n\nWhen present, you must place the ingredient list on dietary supplements immediately below the nutrition label, or if there is insufficient space below the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right of the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhat type size must I use for the ingredient list?\n\nYou must display this information prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the types size be less that 1/16 inch in height as measured by the lower case \"0\", or its equivalent, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.105(h)(2).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(c), 21 CFR 101.15, and 21 CFR 101.105(h)(1) and (2)\n\nMust I list the ingredients in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight. This means that the ingredient that weighs the most is first and the ingredient that weighs the least is last.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)\n\nHow must I declare spices, natural flavors, or artificial flavors?\n\nYou must declare these ingredients in ingredient lists by using either specific common or usual names or by using the declarations \"spice,\" \"natural flavor\" or \"artificial flavor,\" or any combination thereof.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(h)(1) and 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nCan I indicate that a spice is also a coloring?\n\nTop 0Yes. Paprika, turmeric, saffron and other spices that are also colorings, may be declared either by name or the term \"spice and coloring.\" For example, paprika may be listed as \"paprika\" or as \"spice and coloring.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.22(a)(2)\n\n10. How must I declare artificial colors?\n\nIt depends on whether or not the artificial color is certified. List a certified color by its specific or abbreviated name, e.g., \"FD&C Red No. 40\" or \"Red 40.\"\n\nA color that is not certified may be listed as an \"Artificial Color,\" \"Artificial Color\n\nAdded,\" \"Color Added,\"or by its specific common or usual name.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(k)(1) and (k)(2)\n\n11. May I use \"and/or\" labeling for fats and oils?\n\nYes. When a blend of fats and/or oils is not the predominant ingredient of your product and you vary the makeup of the blend you may use \"and/or\" labeling or language such as:\n\nINGREDIENTS:...vegetable oil shortening (contains one or more of the following:\n\ncottonseed oil, palm oil, soybean oil).\"\n\n21 CFR 101.4(b)(14)\n\n12. Do I need to list water?\n\nYes. You must identify the added water in the list of ingredients in descending order of\n\npredominance by weight. For example:\n\n\"Ingredients: Cod liver oil, gelatin, water, and glycerin\"\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a) and (c) and 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iv)\n\n13. How do I list a chemical preservative?\n\nYou must list the common or usual name of the preservative followed by a description\n\nthat explains its function e.g., \"preservative,\" \"to retard spoilage,\" \"a mold inhibitor,\"\n\n\"to help protect flavor,\" or \"to promote color retention.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.22(j)\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter V.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter \"o,\" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement \"Made in the U. S. A.\"? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements. The U.S. Customs Service regulates country of origin marking (i.e., \"Made in the U.S.A.\") as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930. Their website is www.customs.ustreas.gov.\n* 13.How do I obtain a UPC bar code? The UPC bar code may be obtained from the Uniform Code Council. Their website is www.uc-council.org. Click on the button that says \"I Need a UPC Bar Code.\"\n* 14.Must expiration dating be included on the label of dietary supplements? No. However, a firm may include this information if it is supported by valid data demonstrating that it is not false or misleading.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter I.

For example, if the directions on your label say to take 1-3 tablets with breakfast, the serving size would be 3 tablets.\n\n21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2 in the Miscellaneous Category\n\n5 May I use flexibility in the wording for \"Serving Size?\"\n\nNo. You must use the term \"Serving Size.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)\n\nNutrient Declaration\n\nWhat nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nTotal calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron must be listed when they are present in measurable amounts. A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as \"zero\" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for \"% Daily Value\" that refers to the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, not in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel. Ingredients in dietary supplements that are not dietary ingredients, such as binders, excipients, fillers, must be included in the ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nMust I declare vitamin E when it occurs naturally in my product and I make no claim for it?\n\nNo. Because Vitamin E is not one of the 14 mandatory dietary ingredients, it does not need to be declared when it occurs naturally.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMay I declare protein on the label if my product contains only individual amino acids?\n\nNo. You may not declare protein on your products that contain only amino acids.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMust I list the dietary ingredients in my products in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list \"folic acid\" or \"folacin\" without parentheses in place of \"folate.\" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

In Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, Or Holding Operations For Dietary Supplements (72 FR 34752). The Dietary Supplement (DS) CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 111 (\"the DS CGMP rule\") requires persons who manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement to establish and follow current good manufacturing practice to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and to ensure that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record.\n\nThe Federal Register (72 FR 34959), FDA also issued an interim final rule (the identity testing interim final rule) setting forth a procedure for requesting an exemption from a requirement of the DS CGMP rule for the manufacturer to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any dietary ingredient that is a component of a dietary supplement. The provisions of the identity testing interim final rule have the full force of law, but FDA provided a 90-day comment period on those provisions through September 24, 2007. On September 17, 2007, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to extend the comment period to October 24, 2007.\n\nThe DS CGMP rule and the identity testing interim final rule were effective as of August 24, 2007. The compliance dates are described below.\n\nFDA has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in the DS CGMP rule 1111.

Am I subject to the holding requirements established in the DS CGMP rule if I am a retailer who operates a warehouse or storage facility?\n\nYes. The \"retail exemption\" does not apply to you, because a retail establishment does not include a warehouse or other storage facility for a retailer or a warehouse or other storage facility that sells directly to individual consumers (21 CFR 111.1(b); 72 FR 34752 at 34792).\n6. Do the requirements of the DS CGMP rule apply to all types of dietary supplements (e.g., for botanical dietary supplements and for vitamin/mineral dietary supplements)?\n\nYes.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34913)\n\nB. How the DS CGMP Rule Applies to Specific Types of Operations\n\nAm I subject to the DS CGMP rule if I package, label, or distribute a dietary supplement manufactured by another firm?\n\nYes. The DS CGMP rule requires you to comply with those provisions directly applicable to the operations you perform.\n\nFor example, if you are a labeler, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nRequires you to comply with the requirement in 21 CFR 111.255 to establish a batch production record;\n\nRequires you to comply with other applicable requirements, such as requirements for personnel, physical plant and grounds, equipment and utensils, and holding operations;\n\nDoes not require you to comply with the requirement of 21 CFR 111.260(e) to include the identity and weight or measure of each component used, because you would be starting from packages that already had been filled rather than from individual components.\n\nAs another example, if you are a distributor who purchases a packaged and labeled dietary supplement and then holds the product in a warehouse for distribution to another physical location, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nRequires you to comply with requirements for holding and distributing; and\n\nRequires you to comply with other applicable requirements, such as requirements for personnel, the physical plant and grounds.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34793)\n9. How does FDA expect to apply the DS CGMP rule to practitioners?\n\nFDA expects to exercise enforcement discretion, on a case-by-case basis, in determining whether to apply the DS CGMP rule to practitioners such as herbalists, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and other related health care providers. For example:\n\nWe expect to exercise discretion in the case of a one-on-one consultation by a practitioner who is adequately trained in his or her profession. We believe such a case may not necessitate the same types of controls as we established in the DS CGMP rule for manufacturing activities on a larger scale. Such a practitioner may make some formulations in advance of the consultation and still make the formulations in very limited quantities for the individual client.\n\nWe are not considering exercising our enforcement discretion with respect to practitioners who prepare batches of dietary supplements and sell them to individual consumers without determining whether the dietary supplement is appropriate for each consumer's needs in a one-on-one personal consultation.\n\nWe are not considering exercising our enforcement discretion with respect to practitioners who prepare batches of a dietary supplement for which there is a known or suspected safety concern.\n\nWe do not expect the number of practitioners subject to the consideration of our enforcement discretion to be very large. Many products manufactured by practitioners would not necessarily be considered to be dietary supplements (e.g., certain products used by traditional Asian medicine practitioners).\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34793)\n\nC. How the DS CGMP Rule Applies to Contractors\n\n1. Does the DS CGMP rule apply to a contractor who provides a service to a firm who is subject to the DS CGMP rule?\n\nYes. Contractors who provide a particular service (such as packaging, labeling or both packaging and labeling) to a firm who is subject to the DS CGMP rule must comply with those regulations directly applicable to the operations they perform for the firm who contracted with them (72 FR 34752 at 34790). For example, if a contractor is a labeler, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nD. Terms Used in the DS CGMP Rule and In This Document\n\n1. What terms does the DS CGMP rule define?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule defines the following terms:\n\nActual yield;\n\nBatch;\n\nBatch number, lot number, or control number;\n\nComponent;\n\nContact surface;\n\nIngredient;\n\nIn-process material;\n\nLot;\n\nMicroorganisms;\n\nPest;\n\nPhysical plant;\n\nProduct complaint;\n\nQuality;\n\nQuality control;\n\nQuality control personnel;\n\nRepresentative sample;\n\nReprocessing;\n\nReserve sample;\n\nSanitize;\n\nTheoretical yield; and\n\nWater activity.\n\nThe DS CGMP rule also explains how we use the following terms:\n\nMust;\n\nWe; and\n\nYou.\n\nE. Other Applicable Statutory Provisions and Regulations\n\n1. Do other statutory provisions and regulations apply to persons who manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplements? Yes. You must comply with other applicable statutory provisions and regulations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to dietary supplements. (21 CFR 111.5)\n2. How does the DS CGMP rule relate to the food CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 110? In establishing 21 CFR part 111, we:\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.23621192574501038", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure/Function Claims\n\nJANUARY 2002\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA's good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency's current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called \"health claims.\"\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn't a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is \"protective against the development of cancer\" or \"reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis\" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are \"relieves crushing chest pain (angina),\" \"improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),\" or \"relief of bronchospasm (asthma).\"\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don't use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman's terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3364277780056", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFood Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Guidance for Industry\n\nSmall Entity Compliance Guide\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling\n\nNutrition Programs Staff, HFS-830\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-1450\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (\"the final rule\"). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" and \"I\" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of \"infants\" (or \"infants 7 to 12 months\") and \"children less than 4 years\" have been changed to \"infants through 12 months\" and \"children 1 through 3 years of age\" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines \"food\" as: \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of \"drug\") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of \"food,\" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9451510310173035"], "When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR's customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer's website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n3 Inventory\n\nIs a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?\n\nIt depends. A pedigree would be required for prescription drug products that are sold, purchased, or traded by a non-ADR after December 1, 2006. In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories.\n\n31. If there are two products on a shelf in a pharmacy, with the same lot number, but one was purchased from an ADR and the other was not, how would the pharmacy know which product came from the ADR and which product came from the non-ADR?\n\nInventory control is a business process. FDA expects firms to be able to identify and differentiate drug products that have been obtained from different sources and maintain appropriate records in compliance with PDMA.\n\n32. Is a pedigree required for inventory acquired through a pharmacy acquisition, merger, or buyout?\n\nNo. The purchase of a pharmacy by another pharmacy would not be considered a wholesale distribution, provided that the drugs purchased by the second pharmacy are dispensed or distributed by that pharmacy in the normal practice of retail pharmacy. Therefore, no pedigree would be required. However, the sale, purchase, or trade of those drugs to another pharmacy or wholesale distributor would be considered a wholesale distribution and a pedigree must be provided if that other pharmacy or distributor is not an ADR. If pedigrees are part of the record for the inventory, they must be provided with the sale, purchase, or trade of the product and retained for the appropriate length of time, as required under 21 CFR SSSS203.50(b) and 203.60(d).\n\nH. Pedigrees\n\n33. What does \"date of each previous transaction\" refer to in 21 C.F.R.\n\nSS 203.50(a)(7)?\n\n\"Date of each previous transaction\" refers to the date of each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the product. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nI. Electronic Pedigrees\n\n34. Will electronic pedigrees that conform to the EPCglobal electronic drug pedigree standards be considered PDMA-compliant? At the time of printing, these standards have not been officially adopted or recognized. Therefore, it is premature for FDA to comment on whether they comply with PDMA requirements.\n\n35. Can paper or electronic pedigrees be used?\n\nSection 203.60(a)(2) states that \"combinations of paper records and electronic records, electronic records and handwritten signatures executed on paper, or paper records and electronic signatures or handwritten signatures executed to electronic records, may be used to meet any of the record and signature requirements of the PDMA.\" Both paper and electronic documents and signatures may be used to meet the pedigree requirement of the Act, provided that the requirements of 21 CFR SS 203.60 are met.\n\nIs RFID the only way to achieve an electronic pedigree?\n\nNo. The PDMA and existing regulations do not require any particular technology for pedigrees. Although FDA has stated on several occasions that RFID is the most promising means to achieve an electronic pedigree, electronic pedigree can also be accomplished using bar codes or other track and trace technologies.\n\nCompliance/Enforcement\n\nWhere should a report be sent if there are concerns regarding a pedigree that has been received?\n\nCriminal activity, possible fraud, diversion, counterfeiting, or any other suspicious activity associated with a pedigree should be reported to FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations at rxdrugcops@oci.fda.gov.\n\nWhat are some examples of issues that might raise questions about the pedigree?\n\nDrugs that are sold below market price\n\nUnexplained gaps in the pedigree\n\nUnexplained differences in ordered product vs. shipped product\n\nUnexplained, unexpected, or unusual changes in supplier chain\n\nUnusual variety of lot numbers relative to the size of the shipment\n\nMultiple, unknown wholesalers from various states listed on the pedigree\n\nIncomplete paperwork, invoices, or other materials that do not match pedigree\n\nPattern of discrepancies in ordered vs. shipped product\n\nDiscrepancies in or missing covert/overt anti-counterfeiting measures\n\nSupplier refuses to provide a wholesale license from the state licensing authority\n\nSupplier wants payment in cash only\n\nA non ADR refuses to provide pedigree documentation\n\nSupplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA.

FDA guidances are available on the FDA website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/defaulthtm.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction and scope\n\nThis guidance sets forth the FDA's policy concerning certain prescription requirements for compounding human drug products2 for identified individual patients under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or Act). It addresses compounding after the receipt of a prescription for an identified individual patient, compounding before the receipt of a prescription for an identified individual patient (anticipatory compounding), and compounding for office use (or office stock).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not apply to drugs compounded for use in animals, to biological products subject to licensure in a biologics license application, or to repackaged drug products. For proposed policies pertaining to compounding drug products from bulk drug substances for use in animals, see FDA\u2019s draft guidance, Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances. For proposed policies pertaining to mixing, diluting, and repackaging biological products, see FDA\u2019s draft guidance, Mixing, Diluting, and Repackaging Biological Products Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics License Application.

FDA guidances are available on the FDA website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/defaulthtm.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nOverview\n\nCompounding Under the FD&C Act\n\nSections 503A and 503B of the FD&C Act address human drug compounding.\n\nSection 503A, added to the FD&C Act by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act in 1997, describes the conditions that must be satisfied for human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or by a licensed physician, to be exempt from the following three sections of the FD&C Act:\n\nsection 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements);\n\nsection 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and\n\nsection 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug applications (NDAs) or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)).\n\nA list of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for the exemptions in section 503A of the FD&C Act appears in the guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nNew section 503B, added to the FD&C Act by the Drug Quality and Security Act in 2013, created a new category of compounders called outsourcing facilities. Section 503B of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be satisfied for human drug products compounded by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in an outsourcing facility to qualify for exemptions from three sections of the FD&C Act:\n\nsection 502(f)(1);\n\nsection 505; and\n\nsection 582 (concerning drug supply chain security requirements).\n\nIn contrast to drug products compounded under section 503A of the FD&C Act, drug products compounded by outsourcing facilities under section 503B are not exempt from CGMP requirements in section 501(a)(2)(B). Outsourcing facilities are also subject to FDA inspections according to a risk-based schedule, specific adverse event reporting requirements, and other conditions that help to mitigate the risks of the drug products they compound.\n\nThe guidance, For Entities Considering Whether to Register As Outsourcing Facilities Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, lists the conditions that are set forth in section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nCompounding, Generally\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nor her office to administer immediately upon diagnosis, rather than asking the physician to order the drug and have the patient return to the health care practitioner for administration.\n\nRisks Associated with Compounded Drug Products\n\nAlthough compounded drugs can serve an important need, they pose a higher risk to patients than FDA-approved drugs. Compounded drug products are not FDA-approved, which means they have not undergone FDA premarket review for safety, effectiveness, and quality. In addition, licensed pharmacists and licensed physicians who compound drug products in accordance with section 503A are not subject to CGMP requirements. Furthermore, FDA does not interact with the vast majority of licensed pharmacists and licensed physicians who compound drug products and seek to qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act for the drug products they compound (see section 3, below) because these compounders are not licensed by FDA and generally do not register their compounding facilities with FDA. Therefore, FDA is often not aware of potential problems with their compounded drug products or compounding practices unless it receives a complaint such as a report of a serious adverse event or visible contamination.\n\nIn 2012, contaminated injectable drug products that a compounding pharmacy shipped to patients and health care practitioners across the country caused a fungal meningitis outbreak that resulted in more than 60 deaths and 750 cases of infection.4 This was the most serious of a long history of outbreaks associated with contaminated compounded drugs. Since the 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak, FDA has investigated numerous other outbreaks and other serious adverse events, including deaths, associated with compounded drugs that were contaminated or otherwise compounded improperly. For example, patients have been hospitalized after receiving compounded non-sterile drugs that were hundreds or even thousands of times their labeled strength.5\n\nFootnote 4: See http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/outbreaks/meningitis.html.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.8196728229522705", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Does a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n\nNo. PDMA applies only to prescription drugs intended for use by man. However, FDA is aware that many human prescription drugs are sold to veterinarians. Given that the human drugs are subject to section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,the pedigree requirements apply to them under section 503(e). Accordingly, wholesale distributors who are not ADRs must provide a pedigree prior to wholesale distribution of human prescription drugs to veterinarians.\n\nIs a pedigree required for the distribution of drug samples?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(7), the distribution of drug samples by manufacturers and authorized distributor's representatives is exempt from the definition of wholesale distribution, so the pedigree requirement does not apply. However, those distributing drug samples must comply with the separate requirements set forth in 21 USC SSS 353(c) and (d) and 21 CFR Part 203..\n\nIs a pedigree required for medical kits that contain prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as convenience kits?\n\nYes. \"Medical kits\" that contain devices and prescription drugs are combination products under 21 CFR SS3.2(e)(2), which are defined as \"two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of a drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products.\" The \"medical kits\" referred to in the question consist of separable finished devices and drugs that are combined in a kit for ready availability and use together in a medical setting. The drug product in the kit retains its separate form and individual packaging. Although these kits may be assigned to FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) as the lead Center for regulatory review when the primary mode of action of the kit is attributable to its device component, regulations for the drug and the device components continue to apply. Because a prescription drug component of a convenience kit is separable, and in the same form as when distributed independently, it is subject to the same pedigree requirements as when it is independently distributed. The pedigree must contain the drug's lot or control number(s), pursuant to 21 CFR SS203.50(a). We recognize that the convenience kit itself may have a lot or control number that is different than that on the prescription drug component. The outer container of the kit should also list the lot or control number of the prescription drug component so that the integrity of the kit's seal would not have to be compromised to confirm that the drug's lot number is the same as that listed in the pedigree. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nDoes PDMA apply to bulk drug substances?\n\nYes. The PDMA applies to drugs subject to SS 503(b) of the Act (i.e., prescription drugs). Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.1, the requirements in 21 CFR Part 203 apply to wholesale distribution of bulk drug substances.\n\nReturns\n\nIs a pedigree required for prescription drugs that are returned from a pharmacy or a physician's office to a wholesaler?Pursuant to the definition of wholesale distribution and other relevant provisions under SS 503(e) of the Act and 21 CFR Part 203, a pedigree is required for returns from a pharmacy or physician's office to a wholesaler unless that pharmacy or physician's office is an ADR for those prescription drugs. Prescription drugs generally are returned for two reasons: (1) the pharmacy or physician's office ordered too much and returns the drug to the wholesaler or manufacturer from whom they purchased the drugs, or (2) the drug is expired or close to expiring, in which case the product is returned to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which it was purchased, or to a reverse distributor for destruction. Pharmacies and physicians' offices generally are not ADRs, and they would find it extremely difficult to provide a pedigree when they return prescription drugs because they would not have received a pedigree if the drugs were purchased from an ADR.\n\nFDA recognizes the disruption that this could cause to the more than 55,000 pharmacies and the hundreds of thousand physicians' offices in the United States. Therefore, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to allow pharmacies and physicians' offices to return drugs that are expired, damaged, recalled, or in some other non-saleable condition, without having to provide a pedigree, provided that (1) they return the drugs to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which they purchased the drugs, or to a licensed reverse distributor for destruction, and (2) they maintain for a period of three years records that document each return and the source from which the pharmacy or physician's office originally purchased the drugs. If the returned prescription drugs are in saleable condition and may subsequently be sold, purchased, or traded by the wholesaler or reverse distributor, then that wholesaler or reverse distributor would be required and expected to pass a pedigree if they are not an ADR for those prescription drugs. Any subsequent pedigree should reflect that the drugs were sold, purchased, or traded to the pharmacy or physician's office and subsequently returned. Because the wholesaler to which the drugs are returned originally sold them to the pharmacy or physician's office, the wholesaler would have all the necessary information to provide a pedigree, even without the pedigree from the pharmacy or physician's office.\n\nFDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR's customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer's website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n3 Inventory\n\nIs a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.374669313430786", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Supplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA. Please see Addendum at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_addendum.pdf\n\n**ADDENDUM to FDA's Guidance for Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers Related to the Preliminary Injunction ordered 12/5/06 in RXUSA Wholesalers, Inc. v. HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding \"each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture\" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(1)-(5). The court order also enjoins FDA from implementing the language in 21 CFR SS 203.50 that requires pedigrees to include lot and control numbers, dosage, container size, and number of containers. As described in more detail below, however, the preliminary injunction does not affect the statutory requirement that pedigrees contain the dates of all listed transactions and the names and addresses of all parties involved in those transactions. In addition, since the court did not enjoin implementation of 21 CFR SS 203.3(u), a written agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler may limit ADR status to a particular lot number(s), dosage, or the number or size of the containers of prescription drugs. We also note that, without the lot number on the pedigree, it would be extremely difficult to track the inventory that matches the pedigree if the inventory is further sold, purchased or traded. Therefore, FDA recommends that the lot or control number, dosage, and the number and size of the prescription drug containers be included on the pedigree even though it is not required while the preliminary injunction is in effect.\n\nPedigrees for all current and future inventory are affected by the preliminary injunction as long is it remains in effect.\n\nB What is not affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\nPedigrees still must be passed by non-authorized distributors of record (non-ADR) prior to each wholesale distribution. In addition, the court does not mention other pedigree-related regulations or other agency-issued documents relating to the pedigree requirement. Accordingly, those regulations and documents, some of which are described below, are not affected by the preliminary injunction.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.3(u). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, defines \"ongoing relationship\" for the purposes of determining who qualifies as an authorized distributor of record (ADR.) As of December 1, 2006, only thosewholesale distributors who have an ongoing relationship (including a written agreement) with the manufacturer, as that term is defined by this regulation, are exempt from the pedigree requirement.\n\nCompliance Policy Guide (CPG) 160.900, which issued in November 2006, remains in effect until December 1, 2007. The CPG describes how FDA intends to prioritize its enforcement efforts regarding the pedigree requirements in the first year after the effective date of 21 CFR SSS 203.3(u) and 203.50. However, FDA will not enforce 203.50(a) as long as the preliminary injunction remains in effect.\n\nAll other definitions in 21 CFR Part 203 that relate to the pedigree requirement, including but not limited to, the definitions of manufacturer and wholesale distribution, have been in effect since December 2000 and remain in effect despite the injunction.\n\nThe names and addresses of all parties to the transaction and the date of the transactions are required by the statute and must be included in the pedigree.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(b). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, requires all wholesale distributors (both ADRs and non-ADRs) involved in the distribution of a prescription drug to retain a copy of the pedigree for three years. Accordingly, all wholesale distributors that provide or receive pedigrees after December 1, 2006, must retain copies of the pedigrees for three years.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(c). This regulation, which also went into effect on December 1, 2006, provides that a manufacturer that subjects a drug to additional manufacturing processes is not required to provide a pedigree identifying previous sales of the drug or its components.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(d). This regulation also went into effect on December 1, 2006, and requires manufacturers to maintain a current written list of all ADRs, to specify whether each ADR is authorized to distribute all of the manufacturer's drug products or only particular products, to update its list of ADRs on a continuing basis, and to make its list of ADRs available for public inspection or copying. Accordingly, as of December 1, 2006, all manufacturers should have available for public inspection a current list of ADRs that indicates which drug products the ADR is authorized to distribute.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.60. This regulation sets forth certain requirements with respect to the use of electronic records and signatures, record retention, and the availability of records for review and reproduction by FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement officials. This regulation has been in effect since December 2000 and remains in effect despite the injunction.\n\nC Since the court's order only applies to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), does this mean that the statutory requirement that non-ADRs provide pedigrees that include \"each prior sale, purchase, or trade\" of the drugs is still in effect?\n\nYes. The court order does not enjoin FDA from enforcing the statute. The court order affects only the regulations at 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). It has been FDA's longstanding position, consistent with the language of the PDMA and its legislative history, that, 21 CFR SS 203.50 notwithstanding, the statute itself requires non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that documents each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer. FDA recognizes, however, that confusion regarding the pedigree requirement could cause disruptions or delays in the nation's drug distribution system. Accordingly, as long as the court order remains in effect, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, as described below. To this end, FDA does not intend to enforce the statute insofar as it requires pedigrees to contain information regarding each transaction going back to the manufacturer. Rather, FDA intends to permit non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that include information regarding transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the prescription drugs. FDA, however, encourages all wholesalers to provide complete pedigrees documenting each prior transaction involving the prescription drug when that information is available.\n\nAppendix D How will FDA apply the court's order outside of the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) and to wholesale distributors that are not plaintiffs in the lawsuit?\n\nFDA believes that limiting application of the preliminary injunction to either the named plaintiffs or the EDNY could lead to confusion and possible disruptions or delays in the nation's drug distribution system and could provide undue advantage to certain wholesale distributors. Accordingly, to the extent that it could be argued that the injunction should be limited in scope, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion in a manner that is consistent with the court's opinion. To this end, as long as the court's order is in effect, FDA does not intend to initiate any enforcement actions against any wholesalers solely for (1) failing to include lot numbers, dosage, container size, or number of containers on a pedigree; or (2) failing to provide a pedigree that goes back to the manufacturer so long as the pedigree otherwise identifies the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs.\n\nAppendix E How does the court's order impact what FDA said in the Guidance to Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers (http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_qa.pdf)?\n\nTo the extent that Questions 2, 9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 29, and 33 refer to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), as long as the preliminary injunction is in effect, such references are limited to the scope of the court's order. For example, if the question states that a pedigree include information about each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer, then the answer would be limited to including information going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the drugs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.2314690351486206", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Is placing the list of ADRs on the manufacturer's web site adequate to meet the provision of making the list available on request to the public, pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)?\n\nYes. We highly encourage manufacturers to post their ADR list on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible, although they are not required to do so. We note that 21 CFR SS 203.50(d) requires the list to be maintained at the manufacturer's corporate offices even when the list is posted on a website.\n\n8 Where can a pharmacist find the list of ADRs?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)(3), manufacturers are required to make their list of ADRs available to the public upon request. However, we recognize that it may be time consuming to get this information from manufacturers' corporate offices. Therefore, we highly encourage manufacturers to post it on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible. FDA will monitor the accessibility of these lists and determine whether further measures are needed to make this information more readily available to pharmacies.\n\nWhat information does a manufacturer have to provide to a wholesaler to enable that wholesaler to comply with the PDMA?\n\nManufacturers are not required under the PDMA to provide any specific information to wholesale customers. However, the information required under 21 CFR SS 203.50(a) for a pedigree statement may be included in the invoice or similar document that would typically accompany or be associated with any shipment of prescription drug products from a manufacturer to a wholesale distributor. FDA encourages manufacturers to do their part to protect public health by furnishing pedigree information to all of their supply chain partners. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat information does an ADR have to provide to a non-ADR to enable that non-ADR to comply with the PDMA (e.g., to pass a pedigree that lists all prior transactions back to the manufacturer)?\n\nADRs are not required to provide a pedigree, whether they obtained the drug directly from a manufacturer, from an ADR, or from a non-ADR. However, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigrees and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. Therefore, when an ADR sells prescription drugs to another ADR or to a non-ADR, the ADR is encouraged to provide pedigree information obtained at the time of the original purchase of the prescription drugs to its wholesale customers. Each wholesale customer of that ADR, in turn, could then provide updated pedigree information with each successive wholesale distribution. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nIf a wholesaler has ADR status for a particular drug product, but it buys that drug from a non-ADR, is the wholesaler still an ADR for that specific quantity of drugs?\n\nYes. If the specific quantity of drugs purchased from the non-ADR falls within the description contained in the written agreement between that purchasing ADR and the manufacturer, then that purchasing wholesaler would have ADR status for that specific quantity of drugs. However, even though the ADR is not required to provide the pedigree when the product is further distributed, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigree documents and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat definition is used to determine who is a manufacturer and, thus, exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nFor purposes of the PDMA, \"manufacturer\" is defined under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates the definition from 21 CFR SS 201.1.\n\n13 Are contract manufacturers considered \"manufacturers\" under the PDMA?\n\nYes. A contract manufacturer falls within the definition of a \"manufacturer\" under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates by reference the definition of \"manufacturer\" set forth in 21 CFR SS 201.1. FDA has received several inquiries regarding the status of an NDA-holder under 21 CFR SSS 203.3(s)/201.1 when that NDA-holder's prescription drugs are made by a contract manufacturer. Unless the NDA-holder has performed the operations necessary to achieve \"manufacturer\" status under 21 CFR SS 201.1, that NDAholder is not technically a \"manufacturer\" of the drugs within the meaning of the 21 CFR SS 203.3(s). In such instances, the NDA-holder would therefore not be exempt from the pedigree requirements on the grounds that it was a manufacturer. Thus, for purposes of the PDMA pedigree requirements only, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion as follows: In those instances where a third party contract manufacturer manufacturers prescription drugs for an NDA-holder, that NDA-holder may also be regarded as a manufacturer of those drugs for purposes of that NDA-holder's compliance with SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act, entering into ADR agreements for those prescription drugs, and for purposes of pedigrees created for those prescription drugs. This exercise of enforcement discretion is not intended to relieve the contract manufacturer of its obligations as a manufacturer, including its obligation to register under SS 510 of the Act, nor is it intended to require the NDA-holder to file such a registration unless the NDA-holder would otherwise be obligated to do so.\n\n14 Is a repackager or relabeler exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nNo. Relabelers and repackagers are not considered to be manufacturers under 21 CFR SS 201.1. Therefore, unless a repackager or relabeler has ADR status with the manufacturer of that product, they are required to provide a pedigree identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n15 Is a pedigree required if an exclusive distribution agreement exists?\n\nNo, so long as the agreement is in writing. By definition, an exclusivity agreement is a written agreement under which the distributor is authorized to distribute the manufacturer's products for a period or time or for a specified volume of products.\n\nAccordingly, such a written agreement would satisfy the requirements related to ADR status in 21 C.F.R. 203.3(u). Please note that, in such instances, the wholesale distributor named in the agreement would have to be included in the manufacturer's list of ADRs under 21 CFR SS 203.50(d).\n\n16 Do non-ADRs have to provide a pedigree if the customer is a physician's office?\n\nYes. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) requires non-ADRs to provide a pedigree before each wholesale distribution of a drug. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc), wholesale distribution is defined as the distribution of prescription drugs to persons other than a consumer or patient. Although a physician's office is not explicitly mentioned in 21 CFR SS 203.50, which discusses pedigree, it is contemplated within the scope of the language set forth in SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act that a pedigree would be provided because physicians offices are not specifically excluded.\n\n17 Are pharmacies required to provide a pedigree when they transfer drug product between pharmacies?For transfers other than intra-company transfers, unless the transfer of prescription drug product from one pharmacy to another is for a documented medical emergency (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(5)), or the sale is of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(10)), retail pharmacies that are not ADRs for the prescription drug products sold or transferred to other retail pharmacies will have to provide a pedigree.\n\nDoes a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4473911225795746", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nJune 2016\n\nCompounding and Related Documents\n\nRevision 2Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n\nGuidance\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications\n\nDivision of Drug Information, WO51, Room 2201\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993\n\nPhone: 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-847-8714\n\ndruginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nor\n\nOffice of Policy\n\nOffice of the Commissioner\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave.\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\n\nPhone: 301-796-4830\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nJune 2016\n\nCompounding and Related Documents\n\nRevision 2\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance was prepared by the Office of Compliance, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nPharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create any rights for or on any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed in the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance announces FDA's intention with regard to enforcement of section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 353a) to regulate entities that compound drugs, now that section 503A has been amended by Congress to remove the advertising and solicitation provisions that were held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 (see section II below). Several parts of section 503A require rulemaking and consultation with a Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee to implement. This guidance explains how the provisions will be applied pending those consultations and rulemaking. This guidance also describes some of the possible enforcement actions FDA can bring against individuals or firms that compound drugs in violation of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to registered outsourcing facilities under section 503B of the FD&C Act.2 Guidance for outsourcing facilities will be issued separately.\n\nFootnote 2: Title I of the Drug Quality and Security Act created a new section 503B of the FD&C Act, entitled \u201cOutsourcing Facilities.\u201d See Pub. L. No. 113-54, \u00a7 102(a), 127 Stat. 587, 587-588 (2013).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 503A was added to the FD&C Act by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-115) (the Modernization Act). Section 503A describes the conditions that must be satisfied for drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist or licensed physician to be exempt from the following three sections of the FD&C Act: (1) section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning current good manufacturing practice); (2) section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and (3) section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug applications (NDAs) or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)).3\n\nFootnote 3: Section 503A of the FD&C Act and this guidance do not apply to positron emission tomography (PET) drugs as defined in section 201(ii) of the FD&C Act or radiopharmaceuticalcuticals (see section 503A(e) of the FD&C Act). Section 503A(e) specifically states that section 503A does not apply to radiopharmaceuticals or to PET drugs as defined in section 201(ii). PET drugs are subject to the current good manufacturing practice requirements of 21 CFR part 212. Section 503A also does not apply to drugs intended for use in animals. The statutory and regulatory provisions governing the compounding of human drug products differ from those governing the compounding of animal drug products. All relevant statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the compounding of animal drug products remain in effect, subject to the requirements of section 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) and 21 CFR part 530.\n\nPreviously, the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act also included restrictions on the advertising or promotion of the compounding of any particular drug, class of drug, or type of drug and the solicitation of prescriptions for compounded drugs. These provisions were challenged in court and held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002.4 Following that decision, in May 2002 FDA issued a compliance policy guide entitled Pharmacy Compounding (May 2002 CPG), which described how FDA intended \"to address pharmacy compounding of human drugs in the immediate future\" as a result of the Supreme Court decision.5 In 2013, section 503A was amended by the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA)6 to remove the advertising, promotion, and solicitation provisions. As a result, the May 2002 CPG is no longer relevant, and it is necessary to explain FDA's current thinking with regard to section 503A.\n\nFootnote 4: See Thompson v. Western States Med. Crr., 535 U.S. 357 (2002).\n\nFootnote 5: _See 67 FR 39,409 (June 7, 2002).\n\nFootnote 6: See Pub. L. No. 113-54 (2013).\n\nThe Federal Register notice announcing the availability of the draft version of this guidance withdrew the May 2002 CPG as well as the November 1998 guidance for industry entitled _Enforcement Policy During Implementation of Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.7\n\nFootnote 7: 78 FR 72,901 (Dec. 4, 2013).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist, the drug substance(s) must be a component of an FDA-approved human drug product. If a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of an FDA-approved human drug product, it must appear on a list of bulk drug substances for use in compounding developed by FDA through regulation (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act). See section III.B.2 below for the interim policy for this provision.\n4. The drug product is compounded using bulk drug substances that are manufactured by an establishment that is registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act (including a foreign establishment that is registered under section 510(i) of the FD&C Act) (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act).\n5. The drug product is compounded using bulk drug substances that are accompanied by valid certificates of analysis for each bulk drug substance (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the FD&C Act).\n6. The drug product is compounded using ingredients (other than bulk drug substances) that comply with the standards of an applicable USP or NF monograph, if one exists, and the USP chapters on pharmacy compounding9 (section 503A(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Footnote 9: Id.\n7. The drug product does not appear on the list, published at 21 CFR 216.24, that includes drug products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market because such drug products or components of such drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective (section 503A(b)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act). See section III.B.1 below.\n8. The licensed pharmacist or licensed physician does not compound regularly or in inordinate amounts any drug products that are essentially copies of commercially available drug products (section 503A(b)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act).\n9. The drug product is not a drug product identified by FDA by regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of that drug product (section 503A(b)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act). See section III.B.3 below.\n10. The drug product is compounded in a state that has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with FDA that addresses the distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products interstate and provides for appropriate investigation by a state agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside such state; or, in states that have not entered into such an MOU with FDA, the licensed pharmacist, licensed pharmacy, or licensed physician does not distribute, or cause to be distributed, compounded drug products out of the state in which they are compounded, more than 5% of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by such pharmacy or physician (sections 503A(b)(3)(B)(i) & (ii) of the FD&C Act). See section III.B.4 below for the interim policy for this provision.\n\n2 Provisions of Section 503A That Require Regulations or Other FDA Actions\n\nSpecific provisions of section 503A of the FD&C Act require rulemaking or other action by FDA. FDA's policy related to these specific provisions is described below.\n\n2.1.1 Withdrawn or Removed List\n--------------------\nContext title: Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.218977451324463"], "Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: G. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticals with immune agonistic properties, selection of the start dose using a minimally anticipated biologic effect level (MABEL) should be considered.\n\nDose Escalation and the Highest Dose in a Clinical Trial (3.2)\n\nIn general, the highest dose or exposure tested in the nonclinical studies does not limit the dose-escalation or highest dose investigated in a clinical trial in patients with cancer. When a steep dose- or exposure-response curve for severe toxicity is observed in nonclinical toxicology studies, or when no preceding marker of severe toxicity is available, smaller than usual dose increments (fractional increments rather than dose doubling) should be considered.\n\nDuration and Schedule of Toxicology Studies to Support Initial Clinical Trials (3.3)\n\nIn Phase 1 clinical trials, treatment can continue according to the patient's response, and in this case, a new toxicology study is not called for to support continued treatment beyond the duration of the completed toxicology studies.\n\nThe design of nonclinical studies should be appropriately chosen to accommodate different dosing schedules that might be utilized in initial clinical trials. It is not expected that the exact clinical schedule always will be followed in the toxicological study, but the information provided from the toxicity studies should be sufficient to support the clinical dose and schedule and to identify potential toxicity. For example, one factor that can be considered is the half-life in the test species and the projected (or known) half-life in humans. Other factors could include exposure assessment, toxicity profile, saturation of receptors, etc. Table 1 provides examples of nonclinical treatment schedules that are commonly used in anticancer pharmaceutical development and can be used for small molecules or biopharmaceuticals. In cases where the available toxicology information does not support a change in clinical schedules, an additional toxicology study in a single species is usually sufficient.\n\nDuration of Toxicology Studies to Support Continued Clinical Development and Marketing (3.4)\n\nThe nonclinical data to support Phase 1 and the clinical Phase 1 data would normally be sufficient for moving to Phase 2 and into second or first line therapy in patients with advanced cancer. In support of continued development of an anticancer pharmaceutical for patients with advanced cancer, results from repeat dose studies of 3 months' duration following the intended clinical schedule should be provided prior to initiating Phase 3 studies. For most pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer, nonclinical studies of 3 months' duration are considered sufficient to support marketing.\n\nWhen considering a change in the clinical schedule, an evaluation of the existing clinical data should be conducted to justify such change. If the clinical data alone are inadequate to support the change in schedule, the factors discussed in section III.C (3.3) above should be considered.\n\nCombination of Pharmaceuticals (3.5)\n\nPharmaceuticals planned for use in combination should be well studied individually in toxicology evaluations. Data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. In general, toxicology studies investigating the safety of combinations of pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer are not warranted. If the human toxicity profile of the pharmaceuticals has been characterized, a nonclinical study evaluating the combination is not usually warranted. For studies in which at least one of these compounds is in early stage development (i.e., the human toxicity profile has not been characterized), a pharmacology study to support the rationale for the combination should be provided. This study should provide evidence of increased activity in the absence of a substantial increase in toxicity on the basis of limited safety endpoints, such as mortality, clinical signs, and body weight. Based on available information, a determination should be made whether or not a dedicated toxicology study of the combination is warranted.\n\nNonclinical Studies to Support Trials in Pediatric Populations (3.6)\n\nThe general paradigm for investigating most anticancer pharmaceuticals in pediatric patients is first to define a relatively safe dose in adult populations and then to assess some fraction of that dose in initial pediatric clinical studies. The recommendations for nonclinical testing outlined elsewhere in this document also apply for this population. Studies in juvenile animals are not usually conducted in order to support inclusion of pediatric populations for the treatment of cancer. Conduct of studies in juvenile animals should be considered only when human safety data and previous animal studies are considered insufficient for a safety evaluation in the intended pediatric age group.\n\nOther Considerations (4)\n\nConjugated Products (4.1)\n\nConjugated products are pharmaceuticals covalently bound to carrier molecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars. The safety of the conjugated material is the primary concern. The safety of the unconjugated material, including the linker used, can have a more limited evaluation. Stability of the conjugate in the test species and human plasma should be provided. A toxicokinetic evaluation should assess both the conjugated and the unconjugated compound after administration of the conjugated material.\n\nLiposomal Products (4.2)\n\nA complete evaluation of the liposomal product is not warranted if the unencapsulated material has been well characterized. As appropriate, the safety assessment should include a toxicological evaluation of the liposomal product and a limited evaluation of the unencapsulated pharmaceutical and carrier (e.g., a single arm in a toxicology study). The principle described here might also apply to other similar carriers. A toxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate. If possible, such an evaluation should assess both the liposomal product and the free compound after administration of the liposomal product.\n\nEvaluation of Drug Metabolites (4.3)\n\nIn some cases, metabolites that have been identified in humans have not been qualified in nonclinical studies. For these metabolites, a separate evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer.\n\nEvaluation of Impurities (4.4)\n\nIt is recognized that impurity standards have been based on a negligible risk, as discussed in ICH Q3A and Q3B. Exceeding the established limits for impurities identified in these ICH guidances could be appropriate for anticancer pharmaceuticals, and a justification should be provided in the marketing application. The justification could include the disease being treated and the patient population, the nature of the parent pharmaceutical (pharmacologic properties, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, etc.), duration of treatment, and the impact of impurity reduction on manufacturing. Further, the qualification assessment could include consideration of either the dose or concentration tested in nonclinical study relative to clinical levels. For genotoxic impurities, several approaches have been used to set limits based on increase in lifetime risk of cancer. Such limits are not appropriate for pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, and justifications described above should be considered to set higher limits. Impurities that are also metabolites present in animal and/or human studies are generally considered qualified.\n\nV Notes (5)\n\nFor nonrodent studies, dose groups usually consist of at least 3 animals/sex/group, with an additional 2/sex/group for recovery, if appropriate (see section II.D (2.4)). Both sexes should generally be used, or justification should be given for specific omissions.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.4164979457855225", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosafety Tests Using In Vivo Assays and Dermal Administration (3.5)\n\nThe main recommendations provided for investigating the systemic route of administration also apply to dermal administration, including those for species selection, study duration, and irradiation conditions. For dermal drug products in general, the clinical formulation should be tested. The intended clinical conditions of administration should be used to the extent possible. Irradiation of the exposed area should take place at a specified time after application, and the interval between application and irradiation should be justified based on the specific properties of the formulation to be tested. Signs of phototoxicity should be assessed based on relevant endpoints (see section III.D(3.4)). The sensitivity of the assay should be demonstrated using appropriate reference compounds. Assessment of systemic drug levels is generally not warranted in dermal phototoxicity studies.\n\nFor dermal drug products, contact photoallergy has often been assessed in a nonclinical study along with acute phototoxicity (photoirritation). However, no formal validation of such assays has been performed. Although the acute photoirritation observed in these studies is considered relevant to humans, the predictivity of these studies for human photoallergy is unknown. For regulatory purposes, such nonclinical photoallergy testing is generally not recommended.\n\nIV Clinical Photosafety Assessment (4)\n\nThere are various options for collecting human data, if warranted, ranging from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial. The precise strategy is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV Assessment Strategies (5)\n\nThe choice of the photosafety assessment strategy is up to the drug developer. ICH M3(R2) suggests that an initial assessment of the phototoxicity potential based on photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class be undertaken before outpatient studies. Characterization of the UV-visible absorption spectrum is recommended as the initial assessment because it can obviate any further photosafety evaluation. In addition, the distribution to skin and eye can be evaluated to inform further on the human risk and the recommendations for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation of phototoxicity potential (in vitro, in vivo, or clinical) should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nFigure 1 provides an outline of possible phototoxicity assessment strategies. The figure is based on the strategies outlined in this section of this guidance. The strategies are flexible. Depending on the particular situation, some portions of the assessment are optional and might not be conducted.\n\nRecommendations for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic Routes (5.1)\n\nv.1.1 Assessment of Phototoxicity Potential (5.1.1)\n\nIf the substance does not have an MEC greater than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 (between 290 and 700 nm), no photosafety testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans. However, it should be noted that phototoxicity by indirect mechanisms (e.g., pseudoporphyria or porphyia), although rare, could still occur. For compounds with MEC values of 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 or higher, if the drug developer chooses to conduct a test for photoreactivity, a negative result could support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section III.B(3.2)). Otherwise, nonclinical and/or clinical photosafety assessment of the substance should be conducted. Available data on the phototoxicity of chemical class-related compounds should be evaluated because this could inform on the approach to be taken.\n\nv.1.2 Evaluation of Phototoxicity (5.1.2)\n\nTo reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R principles, a validated in vitro method should generally be considered before conducting animal testing (see, for example, Directive 2010/63/EU). If the drug developer chooses an in vitro approach, the 3T3 NRU-PT is currently the most widely used assay and in many cases could be considered as an initial test for phototoxicity. The high sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT results in good negative predictivity and the negative results are generally accepted as sufficient evidence that a substance is not phototoxic. In such cases no further testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans.\n\nIn some situations (e.g., poorly soluble compounds), an initial assessment of phototoxicity in an in vitro assay might not be appropriate. In this case, an assessment in animals or in humans could be considered. Alternatively, if drug distribution data are available, they could, on a case-by-case basis, support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section II.B(2.2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome properties of the clinical formulation that could influence the potential phototoxic response (e.g., penetration into skin, intracellular uptake) cannot be evaluated using the 3T3 NRU-PT alone. Therefore, confirmation of the overall negative result in an evaluation using the clinical formulation and/or monitoring during clinical trials can still be warranted.\n\nReconstructed human skin models can be used to assess the phototoxicity potential of clinical formulations. Under adequate test conditions (see section III.C(3.3)), a negative result in a reconstructed human skin assay indicates that the direct phototoxicity potential of the formulation can be regarded as low. In this case, generally no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception).\n\nIf an appropriate in vitro assay is not available, the initial test could be an in vivo phototoxicity test on the clinical formulation. A negative result in an appropriately conducted in vivo animal phototoxicity study would be sufficient evidence that the formulation is not directly phototoxic and no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception). Alternatively, the phototoxicity potential can be assessed in the clinical setting.\n\nFor dermal products where the API or any new excipient has an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm, a photoullergy assessment is generally warranted in addition to phototoxicity testing. Because the predictivity of nonclinical photoullergy tests is unknown, this would typically be a clinical assessment using the to-be-marketed formulation and conducted during phase 3.\n\nPhotosafety evaluation of the clinical formulation delivered via dermal patches can follow the above described principles for clinical dermal formulations. For transdermal patches, the principles for both dermal and systemic drugs should be applied. In addition, the intended clinical use (e.g., skin area recommended for use, duration of application) and the properties of the patch matrix (e.g., being opaque to UV and visible light) should be considered for the overall risk assessment.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n\"otherwise\": data do not support a low potential for phototoxicity or have not been generated (assay/test/evaluation not conducted)\n\nA \"negative\" result in an appropriately conducted in vivo phototoxicity study supersedes a positive in vitro result. A robust clinical phototoxicity assessment indicating no concern supersedes any positive nonclinical results. A positive result in an in vitro phototoxicity test could also, on a case-by-case basis, be negated by tissue distribution data (see text). In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity on the to-be-marketed formulation can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nClinical evaluation could range from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial.\n\nTissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.259760856628418", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor either species, this design could be adapted to replace the corresponding standard chronic study and a separate juvenile animal study in some circumstances.\n\nThe appropriateness of carcinogenicity testing should be addressed before long-term exposure in pediatric clinical trials. However, unless there is a significant cause for concern (e.g., evidence of genotoxicity in multiple tests, or concern for pro-carcinogenic risk based on mechanistic considerations or findings from general toxicity studies), carcinogenicity studies are not recommended to support the conduct of pediatric clinical trials.\n\nXiii. Immunotoxicity (13)\n\nAs stated in the ICH S8 guidance (Ref. 14), all new human pharmaceuticals should be evaluated for the potential to produce immunotoxicity using standard toxicity studies and additional immunotoxicity studies conducted as appropriate based on a weight-of-evidence review, including immune-related signals from standard toxicity studies. If additional immunotoxicity studies are indicated, these should be completed before exposure of a large population of patients (e.g., phase 3).\n\nXiv. Photosafety Testing (14)\n\nThe appropriateness or timing of photosafety testing in relation to human exposure should be influenced by: (1) the photochemical properties (e.g., photoabsorption and photostability) of the molecule, (2) information on the phototoxic potential of chemically related compounds, (3) tissue distribution, and (4) clinical or nonclinical findings indicative of phototoxicity.\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on a drug's photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class should be performed. If assessment of all the available data and the proposed clinical plan indicates a potential for a significant human phototoxicity risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient clinical studies. In addition, a subsequent evaluation of the nonclinical drug distribution to skin and eye should be completed to inform further on the human risk and the need for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation (nonclinical, in vitro or in vivo, or clinical) of phototoxic potential should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nAlternatively, instead of the above stepwise approach, a direct assessment of phototoxic potential in a nonclinical or clinical study can be undertaken. If this study is negative, an early assessment of eye/skin distribution studies and clinical protective measures are not called for.\n\nIf the phototoxicity assessment indicates a potential photocarcinogenic risk, the risk can usually be adequately managed in patients by protective measures including a warning statement in the informed consent for clinical trials and in product information for marketing (Note 6).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor drugs that produce central nervous system activity, regardless of therapeutic indication, it should be considered whether or not an evaluation of abuse liability is warranted. Nonclinical studies should support the design of clinical evaluations of abuse potential, classification/scheduling by regulatory agencies, and product information. There are regional guidance documents on the conduct of nonclinical abuse liability assessment that can be helpful in designing specific abuse liability packages.\n\nNonclinical data collected early in the drug development process can be useful in identification of early indicators of abuse potential. These early indicators would typically be available before first human dose and include the PK/PD profile to identify the duration of action, similarity of chemical structure to known drugs of abuse, receptor binding profile, and behavioural/clinical signs from in vivo nonclinical studies. When no abuse potential is apparent from these early studies, extensive testing in nonclinical abuse liability models might not be warranted. Generally, if the active substance shows signals associated with known abuse liability patterns or the active substance has a novel mechanism of action on the central nervous system, further nonclinical studies are recommended to support large clinical trials (e.g., phase 3).\n\nWhen the metabolite profile and the target for drug activity in rodent are consistent with that of human, the nonclinical abuse liability evaluations should be conducted in rodents. Nonhuman primates should be reserved only for those limited cases where there is clear evidence that they would be predictive of human abuse liability and the rodent model is inadequate. Three types of studies are often completed to evaluate the potential for abuse liability: drug discrimination, self-administration of the compound, and an assessment of withdrawal. When conducted, studies of drug discrimination and self-administration are generally stand-alone. Assessments of withdrawal can sometimes be incorporated within the design of the reversibility arm of a repeated-dose toxicity study. A maximum dose that produces a plasma concentration several-fold higher than that obtained at the therapeutic clinical dose is considered appropriate for these nonclinical abuse assessments.\n\nOther Toxicity Studies (16)\n\nAdditional nonclinical studies (e.g., to identify potential biomarkers, to provide mechanistic understanding) can be useful if previous nonclinical or clinical findings with the product or related products have indicated special safety concerns.\n\nThe approaches for qualifying impurities and degradants are outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B (Refs. 12 and 13). If specific studies are warranted to qualify an impurity or degradant, generally these studies are not warranted before phase 3 unless there are changes that result in a significant new impurity profile (e.g., a new synthetic pathway, a new degradant formed by interactions between the components of the formulation). In these latter cases, appropriate qualification studies can be warranted to support phase 2 or later stages of development.\n\nCombination Drug Toxicity Testing (17)\n\nThis section covers combination drugs that are intended to be co-packaged or administered in a single dosage form (\"fixed formulation\"). The principles outlined can also apply whendeveloping products that will have product information recommendations for co-use with a specific drug, even if not in a fixed combination, and for which there is minimal clinical information regarding the combination.\n\nCombinations covered might involve: (1) two or more late stage entities (defined as compounds with significant clinical experience (i.e., from phase 3 studies and/ or post marketing))' (2) one or more late stage entity(ies) and one or more early stage entities (defined as compounds with limited clinical experience (i.e., phase 2 studies or less)); or (3) more than one early stage entity. For most combinations which involve two late stage entities and for which there is adequate clinical experience with co-administration, combination toxicity studies would generally not be recommended to support clinical studies or marketing unless there is significant toxicological concern (e.g., similar target organ toxicity). This concern would be modified depending on the margins of safety and the ability to monitor the adverse effects in humans. If a study is being conducted to address a cause for significant toxicological concern, it should generally be completed before carrying out clinical studies with the combination.\n\nWhere there are two late stage products for which there is not adequate clinical experience with co-administration, but there are no causes for significant toxicological concern based on the available data, nonclinical combination studies generally are not recommended to support small-scale, relatively short-duration clinical studies (e.g., phase 2 studies of up to 3 months' duration). Nonclinical combination studies, however, are recommended before large-scale or long-term combination trials, as well as for marketing.\n\nFor combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.352623462677002", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosensitization is a general term occasionally used to describe all light-induced tissue reactions. However, in order to clearly distinguish between photoallergy and phototoxicity, the term photosensitization is not used in this guidance.\n\nFor a chemical to demonstrate phototoxicity and/or photoallergy, the following characteristics are critical:\n\nabsorbs light within the range of natural sunlight (290-700 nm)\n\ngenerates a reactive species following absorption of UV-visible light\n\ndistributes sufficiently to light-exposed tissues (e.g., skin, eye)\n\nIf one or more of these conditions are not met, a compound will usually not present a concern for direct phototoxicity. However, increased sensitivity of skin to light can also occur through indirect mechanisms. Such mechanisms are not generally addressed by the testing outlined in this guidance (see also section II.D(2.4)).\n\nII Factors to Consider in the Photosafety Evaluation (2)\n\nPhotochemical Properties (2.1)\n\nThe initial consideration for assessment of photoreactive potential is whether a compound absorbs photons at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm. A compound that does not have a molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than 1000 L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm (Ref. [3]) is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity (see Note 3 for further details).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nexperience with melanin binding drugs suggests such binding alone does not present a photosafety concern.\n\nA single-dose tissue distribution study, with animals assessed at multiple timepoints after dosing, will generally provide an adequate assessment of relative tissue to plasma concentration ratios, tissue residence time, and the potential for retention and accumulation. Assessment timepoints should be appropriately spaced in such a study to account for the drug half-life.\n\nCompounds activated by visible light and exhibiting long elimination half-lives in internal tissues have been demonstrated to cause injury to those tissues if exposed to intense light during medical procedures. Consequently, for those compounds activated by visible light with potent in vivo phototoxicity or known to be phototoxic based on their mechanism of action, such as photodynamic therapy drugs, distribution to internal tissues should be measured and tissue-specific half-lives estimated. Drugs that only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light or have short tissue elimination half-lives are not likely to present a risk to internal tissues even if they are known to be photoreactive.\n\nMetabolite Considerations (2.3)\n\nMetabolites generally do not warrant separate photosafety assessments, because metabolism does not typically result in chromophores that are substantially different from those in the parent molecule.\n\nPharmacological Properties (2.4)\n\nIn many cases, drug-induced phototoxicity is due to the chemical structure and not the pharmacology. However, certain pharmacologic properties (e.g., immunosuppression, perturbation of heme homeostasis) can enhance susceptibility to light-induced effects, such as skin irritation or UV-induced skin tumor formation. The testing strategies outlined in this document are not designed to detect these types of indirect mechanisms. Some of these indirect mechanisms can be identified and evaluated in other nonclinical pharmacology/toxicity testing; however, phototoxicity related to other indirect mechanisms might only become apparent with human experience.\n\nIII Nonclinical Photosafety Tests (3)\n\nGeneral Considerations (3.1)\n\nCarefully selected conditions that consider both the model system and exposure to a relevant radiation spectrum are critical for nonclinical photosafety testing. Ideally, a nonclinical assay should exhibit both high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., low false negative and low false positive rates). However, to support the assessment strategies described in this document, it is most important that nonclinical photosafety assays show high sensitivity resulting in a low frequency of false negatives (i.e., a high negative predictive value). This is because negative assay results usually do not warrant further photosafety evaluation. The available nonclinical assays, both in vitro and in vivo, are focused primarily on detecting potential phototoxicity, which might or might not translate into clinically relevant phototoxicity.\n\nSelection of irradiation conditions is critical for both in vitro and in vivo assays. Natural sunlight represents the broadest range of light exposure that humans might be exposed to regularly. However, sunlight per se is not well defined and depends on many factors, such as latitude, altitude, season, time of day, and weather. In addition, sensitivity of human skin to natural sunlight depends on a number of individual factors (e.g., skin type, anatomical site and tanning status). Standardized sunlight exposure conditions have been defined by various organizations. Such standards (e.g., CIE-85-1989 (Ref. 5)) should be considered in order to assess suitability of a sunlight simulator light source, and irradiance and irradiation dose should be normalized based on the ultraviolet light A (UVA) part of the applied spectrum. UVA doses ranging from 5 to 20 J/cm({}^{2}) are successfully used in current in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. These UVA doses are comparable to those obtained during prolonged outdoor activities on summer days around noon time, in temperate zones, and at sea level. In humans, sunburn reactions caused by ultraviolet light B (UVB) normally limit total sunlight exposure. In nonclinical phototoxicity assays, however, the amount of UVB should not limit the overall irradiation and might be attenuated (partially filtered) so that relevant UVA doses can be tested without reducing assay sensitivity. Penetration of UVB light into human skin is mainly limited to the epidermis, while UVA can reach capillary blood. Therefore, clinical relevance of photochemical activation by UVB is considered less important than activation by UVA for systemic drugs. However, UVB irradiation is relevant for topical formulations applied to light-exposed tissues.\n\nThe selection and monitoring of appropriate light sources (spectral distribution, irradiance, and dose) and the procedures used should be clearly described in the study methodology (e.g., OECD TG 432 (Ref. 6)).\n\nPhotoreactivity Tests Using Chemical Assays (3.2)\n\nIf a drug developer chooses to assess photoreactivity, the assay should be qualified using pharmaceutical agents under appropriate conditions to demonstrate assay sensitivity. One such assay is an ROS assay (e.g., Ref. 7). Data suggest that this assay has high sensitivity for predicting direct in vivo phototoxicants. However, this assay has a low specificity, generating a high percentage of false positive results. A negative result in this assay, conducted under the appropriate conditions, would indicate a very low probability of phototoxicity, provided a test concentration of 200 (\\mu)M can be achieved, whereas a positive result (at any concentration) would only be a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nPhototoxicity Tests Using In Vitro Assays (3.3)\n\nA number of in vitro assays have been developed for assessing the phototoxicity potential of chemicals. Some of these assays have not been qualified for use with pharmaceuticals. Some assays involve testing compounds that are dissolved in the culture medium, and such methods are often appropriate for the active ingredient or excipients in drug products, depending on their solubility. Other assays involve direct application to the surface of a tissue preparation and can be appropriate for testing entire formulations intended to be administered topically.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe most widely used in vitro assay for phototoxicity is the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3T3 NRU-PT) for which an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline (Ref. 6) is available. This is currently considered the most appropriate in vitro screen for soluble compounds.\n\nAlthough the formal European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) validation exercise conducted on this assay indicated a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 84%, experience within the pharmaceutical industry suggests a much lower specificity. The original OECD protocol was not validated for pharmaceuticals specifically. Thus, some modifications to the original OECD protocol have been proposed to address the low specificity observed with drug substances (see Note 4). These proposed changes are appropriate for the testing of pharmaceuticals. The sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT is high, and if a compound is negative in this assay, it would have a very low probability of being phototoxic in humans. However, a positive result in the 3T3 NRU-PT should not be regarded as indicative of a likely clinical phototoxic risk, but rather a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nThe BALB/c 3T3 cell line is sensitive to UVB, and the initially recommended irradiation conditions (Ref. 6) involve the use of filters to attenuate wavelengths below 320 nm. However, depending on the light source and filters used, the ratio of UVB to UVA can be adjusted such that it is possible to assess UVB-induced phototoxicity in this test. UVB-induced phototoxicity is rarely a problem for pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure because UVB minimally penetrates beyond the epidermis. However, UVB-induced phototoxicity is more relevant for topical products. For components of topically applied products that absorb predominately in the UVB range, and if in vitro assessment is desired, the use of the 3T3 NRU-PT with modified irradiation conditions (see above) can be considered. Alternatively, in vitro skin models, which better tolerate UVB, could be considered.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4494520425796509", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not apply to pharmaceuticals intended for cancer prevention, treatment of symptoms or side effects of chemotherapeutics, studies in healthy volunteers, vaccines, or cellular or gene therapy. If healthy volunteers are included in clinical trials, the ICH M3 guidance should be followed. Radiopharmaceuticals are not covered in this guidance, but some of the principles could be adapted.\n\nGeneral Principles (4)\n\nThe development of each new pharmaceutical calls for studies designed to characterize its pharmacological and toxicological properties according to its intended use in humans.\n\nModification of \"standard\" nonclinical testing protocols generally is warranted to address novel characteristics associated with the pharmaceutical or with the manner in which it is to be used in humans.\n\nThe manufacturing process can change during the course of development. However, the active pharmaceutical substance used in nonclinical studies should be well characterized and should adequately represent the active substance to be used in the clinical trials.\n\nIn general, nonclinical safety studies that are used to support the development of a pharmaceutical should be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices.\n\nII Studies to Support Nonclinical Evaluation (2)\n\nPharmacology (1)\n\nPrior to Phase 1 studies, preliminary characterization of the mechanism(s) of action and schedule dependencies, as well as anti-tumor activity of the pharmaceutical, should have been made. Appropriate models should be selected based on the target and mechanism of action, but the pharmaceutical need not be studied using the same tumor types intended for clinical evaluation.\n\nThese studies can:\n\nprovide nonclinical proof of principle;\n\nguide schedules and dose-escalation schemes;\n\nprovide information for selection of test species;\n\naid in start dose selection and selection of investigational biomarkers, where appropriate; and,\n\nif relevant, justify pharmaceutical combinations.\n\nUnderstanding the secondary pharmacodynamic properties of a pharmaceutical could contribute to the assessment of safety for humans, and those properties might be investigated as appropriate.\n\nSafety Pharmacology (2)\n\nAn assessment of the pharmaceutical's effect on vital organ functions (including cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems) should be available before the initiation of clinical studies; such parameters could be included in general toxicology studies. Detailed clinical observations following dosing and appropriate electrocardiographic measurements in nonrodents are generally considered sufficient. Conducting stand-alone safety pharmacology studies to support studies in patients with advanced cancer is not called for. In cases where specific concerns have been identified that could put patients at significant additional risks in clinical trials, appropriate safety pharmacology studies described in ICH S7A and/or S7B should be considered. In the absence of a specific risk, such studies will not be called for to support clinical trials or for marketing.\n\nPharmacokinetics (2.3)\n\nThe evaluation of limited pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., peak plasma/serum levels, area under the curve (AUC), and half-life) in the animal species used for nonclinical studies can facilitate dose selection, schedule, and escalation during Phase 1 studies. Further information on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the pharmaceutical in animals should normally be generated in parallel with clinical development.\n\nGeneral Toxicology (2.4)\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer is to assess the safety of the pharmaceutical. Phase 1 assessments can include dosing to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicology studies to determine a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or no effect level (NOEL) are not considered essential to support clinical use of an anticancer pharmaceutical. As the toxicity of the pharmaceutical can be greatly influenced by its schedule of administration, an approximation of its clinical schedule should be evaluated in toxicology studies. This is further discussed in sections III.C and III.D (3.3 and 3.4).\n\nAssessment of the potential to recover from toxicity should be provided to understand whether serious adverse effects are reversible or irreversible. A study that includes a terminal nondosing period is called for if there is severe toxicity at approximate clinical exposure and recovery cannot be predicted by scientific assessment. This scientific assessment can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion and the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect. If a study of recovery is called for, it should be available to support clinical development. The demonstration of complete recovery is not considered essential.\n\nFor small molecules, the general toxicology testing usually includes rodents and nonrodents. In certain circumstances, determined case-by-case, alternative approaches can be appropriate (e.g., for genotoxic drugs targeting rapidly dividing cells, a repeat-dose toxicity study in one rodent species might be considered sufficient, provided the rodent is a relevant species). For biopharmaceuticals, see ICH S6 for the number of species to be studied.\n\nToxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate.\n\nReproduction Toxicology (2.5)\n\nAn embryofetal toxicology assessment is conducted to communicate potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are or might become pregnant. Embryofetal toxicity studies of anticancer pharmaceuticals should be available when the marketing application is submitted, but these studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. These studies are also not considered essential for the purpose of marketing applications for pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow) in general toxicity studies or belong to a class that has been well characterized as causing developmental toxicity.\n\nFor small molecules, embryofetal toxicology studies are typically conducted in two species as described by ICH S5(R2). In cases where an embryofetal developmental toxicity study is positive for embryofetal lethality or teratogenicity, a confirmatory study in a second species is usually not warranted.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticales, an assessment in one pharmacologically relevant species should usually be sufficient. This assessment might be done by evaluating the toxicity during the period of organogenesis or study designs as described by ICH S6. Alternative approaches might be considered appropriate if scientifically justified. The alternative approaches might include a literature assessment, assessment of placental transfer, the direct or indirect effects of the biopharmaceutical, or other factors.\n\nA study of fertility and early embryonic development is not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Information available from general toxicology studies on the pharmaceutical's effect on reproductive organs should be used as the basis of the assessment of impairment of fertility.\n\nA pre- and postnatal toxicology study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.\n\nF. Genotoxicity (2.6)\n\nGenotoxicity studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. Genotoxicity studies should be performed to support marketing (see ICH S2). The principles outlined in ICH S6 should be followed for biopharmaceuticales. If the in vitro assays are positive, an in vivo assay might not be warranted.\n\nG. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4692624807357788", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: General Principles (1.4)\n\nThe development of a pharmaceutical is a stepwise process involving an evaluation of both animal and human efficacy and safety information. The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterization of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exposure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility. This information is used to estimate an initial safe starting dose and dose range for the human trials and to identify parameters for clinical monitoring for potential adverse effects. The nonclinical safety studies, although usually limited at the beginning of clinical development, should be adequate to characterize potential adverse effects that might occur under the conditions of the clinical trial to be supported.\n\nHuman clinical trials are conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaceutical, starting with a relatively low systemic exposure in a small number of subjects. This is followed by clinical trials in which exposure to the pharmaceutical usually increases by duration and/or size of the exposed patient population. Clinical trials should be extended based on the demonstration of adequate safety in the previous clinical trial(s), as well as on additional nonclinical safety information that becomes available as clinical development proceeds.\n\nSerious adverse clinical or nonclinical findings can influence the continuation of clinical trials. Within the overall clinical context, these findings should be evaluated to determine the appropriateness and design of additional nonclinical and/or clinical studies.\n\nClinical trials are conducted in phases for which different terminology has been utilized in the various regions. This M3(R2) document generally uses the terminology as defined in the ICH E8 guidance (Ref. 2). However, as there is a growing trend to merge phases of clinical development, in some cases this document also relates the nonclinical studies to the duration and size of clinical trials and the characteristics of the subjects included.\n\nHigh Dose Selection for General Toxicity Studies (1.5)\n\nGenerally, in toxicity studies, effects that are potentially clinically relevant can be adequately characterized using doses up to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It is not essential to demonstrate the MTD in every study. Other equally appropriate limiting doses include those that achieve large exposure multiples or saturation of exposure or use the maximum feasible dose (MFD). These limit doses (see additional details below and Figure 1) prevent the use of doses in animals that would not add value to predicting clinical safety. These recommendations are consistent with those for reproduction and carcinogenicity study designs that already have defined limit doses and/or exposures (Refs. 3 and 4).\n\nLimit doses for acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity studies of 1000 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day for rodents and nonrodents are considered appropriate in all casesexcept those discussed below. In the few situations where a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day does not result in a mean exposure margin of 10-fold to the clinical exposure and the clinical dose exceeds 1 gram (g) per day, then the doses in the toxicity studies should be limited by a 10-fold exposure margin or a dose of 2000 mg/kg/day or the MFD, whichever is lower. In those rare situations in which the dose of 2000 mg/kg/day results in an exposure that is less than the clinical exposure, a higher dose up to the MFD can be considered.\n\nDoses providing a 50-fold margin of exposure (usually based on group mean area under the curve (AUC) values (see Note 1) of the parent drug or the pharmacologically active molecule of a pro-drug) to the clinical systemic exposure generally are also considered acceptable as the maximum dose for acute and repeated-dose toxicity studies in any species.\n\nTo support phase 3 clinical trials for the United States, dose-limiting toxicity generally should be identified in at least one species when using the 50-fold margin of exposure as the limit dose. If this is not the case, a study of 1 month or longer duration in one species that is conducted at the 1000 mg/kg limit dose, MFD or MTD, whichever is lowest, is recommended. However, on a case-by-case basis this study might not be warranted if a study of a shorter duration identifies dose-limiting toxicity at doses higher than those resulting in a 50-fold exposure margin.\n\nIf genotoxicity endpoints are to be incorporated into a general toxicity study, then an appropriate maximum dose should be selected based on a MFD, MTD, or limit dose of 1000 mg/kg/day.\n\nFigure 1: Recommended High Dose Selection for General Toxicity Studies\n\nII Pharmacology studies (2)\n\nSafety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies are defined in ICH S7A (Ref. 5). The core battery of safety pharmacology studies includes the assessment of effects on cardiovascular, central nervous, and respiratory systems, and should generally be conducted before human exposure, in accordance with ICH S7A and S7B (Refs. 5 and 6). When warranted, supplemental and follow-up safety pharmacology studies can be conducted during later clinical development. Consideration should be given to inclusion of any in vivo evaluations as additions to general toxicity studies, to the extent feasible, in order to reduce animal use.\n\nIn addition, primary PD studies (in vivo and/or in vitro) are intended to investigate the mode of action and/or effects of a substance in relation to its desired therapeutic target. Such studies are generally conducted during the discovery phase of pharmaceutical development and as such, are not generally conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). These studies can contribute to dose selection for both nonclinical and clinical studies.\n\nIII Toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic studies (3)\n\nIn vitro metabolic and plasma protein binding data for animals and humans and systemic exposure data (ICH S3A, Ref. 7) in the species used for repeated-dose toxicity studies generally should be evaluated before initiating human clinical trials. Further information on pharmacokinetics (PK) (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) in test species and in vitro biochemical information relevant to potential drug interactions should be available before exposing large numbers of human subjects or treating for long duration (generally before phase 3). These data can be used to compare human and animal metabolites and for determining if any additional testing is warranted.\n\nNonclinical characterization of a human metabolite(s) is only warranted when that metabolite(s) is observed at exposures greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater levels in humans than the maximum exposure seen in the toxicity studies. Such studies should be conducted to support phase 3 clinical trials. For drugs for which the daily administered dose is (<)10 mg, greater fractions of the drug related material might be more appropriate triggers for testing. Some metabolites are not of toxicological concern (e.g., most glutathione conjugates) and do not warrant testing. The nonclinical characterization of metabolites with an identified cause for concern (e.g., a unique human metabolite) should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIV Acute Toxicity Studies (4)\n\nHistorically, acute toxicity information has been obtained from single-dose toxicity studies in two mammalian species using both the clinical and a parenteral route of administration. However, such information can be obtained from appropriately conducted dose-escalation studies or short-duration dose-ranging studies that define an MTD in the general toxicity test species (Refs. 8 and 9).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen this acute toxicity information is available from any study, separate single-dose studies are not recommended. Studies providing acute toxicity information can be limited to the clinical route only and such data can be obtained from non-GLP studies if clinical administration is supported by appropriate GLP repeated-dose toxicity studies. Lethality should not be an intended endpoint in studies assessing acute toxicity.\n\nIn some specific situations (e.g., microdose trials; see section VII (7) acute toxicity or single-dose studies can be the primary support for studies in humans. In these situations, the high dose selection can be different from that described in section I.E (1.5), but should be appropriate for supporting the intended clinical dose and route. These studies should be performed in compliance with GLP.\n\nInformation on the acute toxicity of pharmaceutical agents could be useful to predict the consequences of human overdose situations and should be available to support phase 3. An earlier assessment of acute toxicity could be important for therapeutic indications for which patient populations are at higher risk for overdosing (e.g., depression, pain, and dementia) in out-patient clinical trials.\n\nV Repeated-dose Toxicity Studies (5)\n\nThe recommended duration of the repeated-dose toxicity studies is usually related to the duration, therapeutic indication, and scope of the proposed clinical trial. In principle, the duration of the animal toxicity studies conducted in two mammalian species (one nonrodent) should be equal to or exceed the duration of the human clinical trials up to the maximum recommended duration of the repeated-dose toxicity studies (Table 1). Limit doses/exposures that are considered appropriate in repeated-dose toxicity studies are described in section I.E (1.5).\n\nIn circumstances where significant therapeutic gain has been shown, trials can be extended beyond the duration of supportive repeated-dose toxicity studies on a case-by-case basis.\n\nClinical Development Trials (5.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8854914903640747"], "When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Published data;\n\nTest results generated by the animal drug product sponsor.\n\nThe principles described in ICH Q9, \"Quality Risk Management,\"3 and ICH Q3D should be considered. Control approaches should be proportional to the level of risk (see Q5, Q9, Q10, and Appendix I).\n\nFootnote 3: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/q9-quality-risk-management.\n\nQ4. How should the potential for the container closure and manufacturing equipment to leach elemental impurities into the drug product be addressed?\n\nA. CVM considers the risk of elemental impurities from the container closure to be low in most cases. The probability of elemental leaching into solid dosage forms is minimal and does not require further evaluation in the risk assessment. For liquid and semi-solid dosage forms, if the primary container closure components may introduce elemental impurities into the drug product at levels that present a safety concern, adequate controls should be in place. If the supplier certifies that the materials of construction of the primary packaging meet the applicable requirements of the USP and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the animal drug product sponsor will not be asked to confirm the COA results for extractable metals. If a statement or data are unavailable from the manufacturer of the primary packaging regarding elemental impurities, CVM recommends performing at a minimum a test for heavy metals, such as the procedure previously described in USP <231>, for containers used for liquid and semi-solid dosage forms. The probability of elemental leaching into solid dosage forms is minimal and does not require further evaluation in the risk assessment. If the primary container closure components are expected to introduce elemental impurities into the drug product at levels that present a safety concern, adequate controls should be in place or testing of the drug product may be necessary.\n\nCVM considers the risk from manufacturing equipment to be low in most cases if appropriate, qualified equipment is selected for the process and GMP requirements (21 CFR parts 210, 211, and 226) are met. Unless an unusual amount of chemical corrosion or mechanical erosion of equipment results from the manufacturing process, no further assessment is expected.\n* Can a non-specific test, such as the test for heavy metals previously described in USP <231>, be used to test a component, or should instrumental methods, such as those described in USP <233> be used?\n* Procedures with selectivity and sufficient sensitivity for individual elements, such as the procedures described in USP <233>, should be used where controls for individual elements are necessary based on the risk assessment (see Appendix I for additional guidance). Non-specific tests, such as the procedures previously described in USP <231>, are unsuitable for controlling elemental impurities below acceptable limits. Non-specific tests for components determined to be low risk based on the risk assessment may be maintained at the sponsor's discretion. Previously reported non-specific tests can typically be deleted (see Q6 below). If you choose to maintain a non-specific test, it can be kept on site and should not be submitted to the file.\n* For approved products, should we continue to perform the USP <231> test for heavy metals where it is included in the approved specifications for components of a drug product?\n* The USP <231> test for heavy metals has significant limitations and we therefore do not recommend that it be used for controlling elemental impurities below acceptable limits where controls for individual elements are necessary based on the risk assessment. The heavy metals test and limit may be deleted, and the change may be reported in the next Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR). If the test method is maintained, it can be kept on site and should not be submitted to the file.\n* Some USP monographs contain limits for specific elements and, in some cases, a different general chapter, such as USP <211>, Arsenic, or USP <251>, Lead, is referenced. Do these limits apply to veterinary products?\n* At a minimum, these materials should continue to meet the requirements in the monograph, including the limits for specified elements, unless a risk-based justification supports their omission. An instrumental method consistent with those described in USP <233> may be used as an alternative to the referenced procedure.\n* If a certificate of analysis for an excipient or drug substance contains test results for specific elements using an instrumental method per USP <233>, do these tests need to be confirmed as part of vendor qualification?\n* This depends on the risk assessment. Communication with the supplier regarding the reason for including limits for specific elements is recommended. The results should be confirmed by the animal drug product sponsor only when deemed necessary by the risk assessment (see Q10 and Appendix I).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ9. When specified elements are known to be present in one or more of the excipients or the drug substance, how should the elemental impurity daily exposure from the drug product be assessed?\n\nA. The daily exposure to the elements should be calculated based on the supplier's limit, the amount of the excipient or drug substance in the drug product, and the maximum daily dose. If the same element may be introduced by more than one component of the drug product, the total exposure should be calculated. CVM generally considers the Permitted Daily Exposures (PDEs) for humans established in ICH Q3D in units of (\\mu)g/day acceptable for the safety of animal drug products. The calculated elemental impurity daily exposure should result in a level equal to or below the ICH Q3D PDE for the drug product; however, CVM recognizes that the PDEs in ICH Q3D are for humans. If the calculated elemental impurity content of the animal drug product exceeds the PDE in ICH Q3D, the animal drug product spons may provide a justification or contact CVM to discuss the product and veterinary-specific considerations.\n\nQ10. Even in cases where the COA includes results for elemental impurities and a specific risk factor has been identified, often the excipient or drug substance make up a small percentage of the drug product or the COA results demonstrate that the elements are controlled at low levels. Is there a threshold at which we would not be expected to confirm the COA results?\n\nA. If the elemental impurity content listed on the COA will lead to a daily exposure that is not more than 30% of the PDE for an element, the risk from the component can usually be considered below the threshold at which additional testing by the drug product manufacturer is necessary (see Appendix I), and confirmation of the COA values for elemental impurities will not be requested. If the 30% control threshold will be applied, the total daily exposure should not exceed 30% of the PDE in cases where the same element may be introduced by multiple components of the drug product.\n\nIf the 30% threshold is exceeded but the elements are below the PDE, the drug product manufacturer should confirm the component COA results for vendor qualification, or, alternatively, test every lot of the drug product to ensure that the element does not exceed the PDE. A test that is selective for the element should be used unless an alternative approach can be justified. The test method(s) and limit(s) should be submitted to the file (see Q11 below). Reduced testing may be appropriate for a qualified supplier in accordance with 21 CFR 211.84(d)(2). The test may also be discontinued if sufficient data are generated to support that the element remains below 30% of the PDE.\n\nQ11. What information should be submitted to the file?\n\nA. If test methods and limits for elemental impurities in components or the drug product are deemed necessary based on the risk assessment, they should be submitted to the file. If the drug product will be tested for elemental impurities, the method validation should also be submitted to the file. If one of the compendial procedures described in USP <233> is used, the animal drug product spons may simply reference that chapter for the method.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe risk assessment, any calculations, and any method validations for methods for elemental impurities in components, where applicable, should be kept on site to provide to an investigator upon request (see 21 CFR parts 210, 211, and 226). CVM may request additional information on a case-by-case basis.\nQ12. How should updates to the test methods and limits be reported to the file?\n\nFor approved products, this information can be provided in an annual MCSR unless a new testing facility is requested. A new testing facility should be reported in a supplement (please see CVM Guidance for Industry #83, \"Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA\"4). Footnote 4: https://www.fda.gov/media/70323/download\n\nQ13. Does this guidance apply to Type A medicated articles?\n\nYes. When a specific risk factor has been identified that may lead to introduction of elemental impurities into the Type A medicated article, any calculations of the daily exposure should take into account the ultimate dilution of the Type A to produce a predicated feed.\nQ14. What if the drug product contains elements that are for therapeutic benefit?\n\nThis guidance does not apply to elements that are present in a form that is for therapeutic benefit (e.g., as part of the active pharmaceutical ingredient). However, the sponsor's risk assessment should consider the potential for elemental impurities to be present at elevated levels based on the composition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.\nQ15. When is it necessary to reassess the risk for the drug product?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #255 Elemental Impurities in Animal Drug Products Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8668922185897827", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Generally, if studies using a proposed new animal drug product's final formulation are not available for inclusion in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable), this will limit the applicability of the information.29 The acceptability of published studies will depend on the complexity of the formulation, how much control the sponsor had over the manufacturing process, etc. CVM will evaluate the drug product used in each published study included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) using information on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form. The level of documentation and known information is usually not the same as what is included in a single adequate and well-controlled study submitted to CVM with raw data. However, the assessment of how much a formulation and other critical quality attributes can deviate from the proposed/final formulation is generally the same regardless of the type of study (SRMA or single prospectively designed study). Footnote 29: Formulation changes to a drug product may occur over time and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine their potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. These principles are discussed in more detail in Guidance for Industry #83, \u201cChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA\u201d (May 2007). In some cases, studies will be necessary to establish the equivalence of different formulations (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, and/or clinical studies as appropriate).\n\nAs noted in section III.B.3. Critical Factors, literature using the proposed final formulation manufactured by or for the sponsor provides the best, most rigorous evaluation and the highest evidentiary weight. If a sufficient number of studies using an acceptable formulation are not available or a connection to information found in the CMC technical section cannot be made, the SR approach will be unlikely to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. Footnote 29: The sponsor should provide CVM with an assessment of the information, a meaningful evaluation of the new animal drug used in the publishedreport included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) and a justification that it is appropriate to use the data generated in the study along with other studies in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable). The decision about the value of the information from the published studies to the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) will be made with the collaboration of ONADE's Division of Manufacturing Technologies and the target animal review team.\n\nAdequate and well-controlled studies, including SRs, include the use of methods to assess the animal response to the use of the new animal drug that are well defined and reliable (21 CFR 514.117(b)(8)). Sponsors should consider whether there are a sufficient number of studies which report the appropriate endpoint(s) in a consistent manner which would allow for quantification of the effect of the new animal drug.\n\nProtocol considerations specific to effectiveness:\n\nReview question: The review question should closely match the objectives of the study and follow the format described in section III.B.3.b.i. Developing the Review Question of this guidance. In general, effectiveness study review questions follow the format: \"Evaluation of the effectiveness of [drug product and dose if appropriate] for [indication] as compared to [control type] in [species/class/animal age as appropriate].\"\n\nDefinition of the control: Please refer to section III.B.3.b.ii. Writing the protocol (Control Type).\n\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Examples of screening inclusion/exclusion criteria which may be assessed based on the title, abstract, and/or key words include:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nScreening Inclusion & Screening Exclusion \\ \\hline Study types: Complete reports (published or unpublished) on & Incomplete reports (abstracts and \\ randomized controlled trials (RCTs), & reviews), or insufficient information \\ cluster RCTs, and select non- & to assess these criteria (incomplete \\ randomized controlled studies & reports may not be excluded if full \\  & information could be obtained from \\  & the study investigator) \\ \\hline Study includes intended target animal & Study includes animals that are not \\ species and class & representative of the target animal \\  & species and class \\ \\hline Use of the drug product of interest (at & Drug product of interest not a part \\ screening phase, identification of & of the study \\ active ingredient may be sufficient) & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExamples of eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria based on assessment of the full text of the publication:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nEligibility Inclusion & Eligibility Exclusion \\ \\hline Drug product as defined in the protocol & Study does not include drug product \\  & as defined in protocol, or \\  & publication does not provide \\  & sufficient information to identify \\  & the drug product (unable to confirm \\  & formulation used in the study) \\ \\hline Study uses intended label dosage (dose,  frequency, and route of administration) & Dosage used in study inconsistent \\  & with the intended label dosage \\ \\hline Study includes the use of acceptable & Study includes the use of \\   concurrent therapies (e.g., the studies & concurrent therapy that may \\   may employ concurrent therapies per & confound the effectiveness \\   the current standards of care; however, & evaluation \\   these considerations should be & \\   described clearly within the protocol.) & \\ \\hline Study designed to evaluate endpoint(s) & Study not designed to evaluate \\   of interest & endpoint(s) of interest \\ \\hline Screening and eligibility inclusion and exclusion criteria should only evaluate & whether the measurement of an effectiveness outcome is present and should \\   not specify a particular effectiveness outcome for inclusion in the & \\   effectiveness database. For example, studies that do not demonstrate the & \\   desired level of effect or that report a poor effectiveness outcome should not & \\   be excluded from the effectiveness database. & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n* Basis of study conclusion: The protocol should clearly state the criteria on which study conclusions will be based. The study objectives and the statistical analysis results should be considered when defining the criteria. For example, a threshold for an effect size or a threshold for the limits of a confidence interval for the effect size could be used as criterion. In addition, the study conclusion should also consider bias investigation results.\n\n4 Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness\n\nSection 571 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360ccc) provides for a qualified approval pathway, open only to certain qualifying new animal drug products based on indication and type, called conditional approval. Conditional approval allows a sponsor to legally market a new animal drug after demonstrating the drug is safe and manufactured in accordance with the full approval standards, and that there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. To obtain conditional approval, all technical sections must be complete except the effectiveness technical section, which isreplaced with RXE. The sponsor can market the conditionally approved new animal drug product for up to 5 years while gathering the remaining data required to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. The pathway requires annual renewal of the conditional approval to determine whether the sponsor is making sufficient progress toward meeting the effectiveness standard for full approval. Literature may be used as one of the pathways to support RXE. Screening and eligibility criteria for publications that may be used to support RXE are generally the same as for substantial evidence of effectiveness; however, the overall body of evidence may be smaller and information gaps may still be present. Full scoping or systematic literature reviews are not routinely expected but may be appropriate.\n\nAppendix E Target Animal Safety\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nSection 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval, including target animal safety. See FD&C Act section 512(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D)).\n\nLiterature, including narrative reviews, SR, and meta-analysis, may be acceptable to fulfill all or part of the requirements for target animal safety for a new animal drug application or an application for conditional approval (see FD&C Act section 571(a)(2)(B)). Literature is most commonly used to evaluate the extent and quality of information available on the safety of a new animal drug for the proposed indication or proposed conditions of use, support the design of the target animal safety evaluation, and/or provide information to predict potential adverse effects in the target species. In some cases, literature may provide all or a portion of the information required to demonstrate whether a new animal drug is safe for the intended use and conditions of use.\n\nCVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the development plan to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of using literature to fulfill some or all of the target animal safety requirements.\n\nAppendix B Preliminary Information\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.421543836593628", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: #156\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nComparability Protocols -\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and\n\nControls Information\n\nfor New Animal Drugs\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.7835710048675537", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Recommendations for executed (completed) batch records are provided in CVM guidance for industry [42]: Animal Drug Manufacturing Guidelines-Series of Four Guidelines (1994). CVM encourages the submission of executed batch records for lots of drug substance and drug product used in support of the application as they provide valuable detail and insight into the manufacturing process and proposed controls.\n\na.1.1 Pharmaceutical Development Reports\n\nSponsors are encouraged to provide pharmaceutical development reports (PDRs) that describe the scientific rationale for the chosen manufacturing process(es) and controls for fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and related drug products. A sponsor's ability to demonstrate process understanding can be factored into CVM's risk-based decision making (e.g., Pre-Approval Inspection Decision Support System (PAIDSS)). Suggestions for PDRs can be found in ICH Q8: Pharmaceutical Development.\n\na.1.2 Cell Growth (Propagation) and Harvest\n\nA description should be provided that includes a flow diagram illustrating each step in propagation from the original inoculum (e.g., cells from one or more vials of the working cell bank) through the last harvesting operation.\n\nAll steps should be included along with the relevant information, such as the growth conditions and in-process tests performed (e.g., cell concentrations, volumes, pH, cultivation times, temperatures).\n\nCritical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with sampling plans and testing time points.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe flow diagram can be supplemented with information presented in tabular form, if appropriate.\n\nA narrative describing each manufacturing step in the process should accompany the flow diagram:\n\nIdentify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria\n\nHighlight any process controls that are considered critical\n\nIdentify the intended scale of the process. The amounts indicated should be representative of a maximum-sized production batch.\n\nWe recommend the following be included in the narrative:\n\nA description of the major equipment involved in each step\n\nA description of inoculation and each step in propagation with growth conditions specified\n\nThe composition of the media used at each step, including water quality and additives used\n\nThe sterilization procedures for media (e.g. a batch sterilization process or continuous system)\n\nThe equipment (e.g. fermentation vessel), feeds, and other materials added during the fermentation process\n\nProcess parameters monitored and controls for critical steps and intermediates\n\nProcedures used to transfer material between steps\n\nProcedures used to minimize contamination by adventitious agents\n\nProcess controls to confirm the effectiveness of the specific manufacturing steps used to inactivate and or remove adventitious agents\n\nCriteria for harvesting\n\nCriteria for rejecting/accepting a fermentation batch if contamination occurs\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nCriteria for pooling more than one harvest, if applicable\n\nStorage conditions and time limits if the harvested crude fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n3. Purification and Downstream Processing\n\nThe description should include a flow diagram that illustrates and a narrative that describes all the steps involved in isolating and purifying the crude fermentation product to its final form, along with any relevant information (e.g., volumes, pH, temperatures, holding times). Critical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with testing time points.\n\nThe narrative describing each manufacturing step should accompany the flow diagram and should identify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria and include the following:\n\nMethods used in purification or separation of the crude fermentation product (e.g. precipitation, centrifugation, filtration) including major equipment (e.g. columns, membranes* Process parameters monitored\n\nThe in-process controls and analytical tests used to show identity, purity, and concentration and to evaluate levels of process- and product-related impurities\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nPrecautions taken to prevent or control microbial contamination during purification\n\nConditions for reuse and/or procedures for regeneration of columns, membranes, and adsorbents\n\nStorage conditions and time limits, if the purified fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n4. Modification Reactions (If Applicable)\n\nChemical Modifications\n\nWhen a product of fermentation is to be subjected to further molecular change through chemical means, a description of the synthetic steps should be included in the procedural narrative.\n\nAdditionally, a flow diagram of the synthetic process should be provided. For more details, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nEnzymatic Modifications\n\nWhen the fermentation product is further modified using enzyme catalysts, the steps should be included in the flow diagram and detailed in the procedural narrative. Enzymatic reactions are considered chemical reactions since the conversion of substrate product involves breaking and forming chemical bonds. Thus, much of the information submitted in the manufacturing description should be the same as that submitted for chemical processes (drug substance).\n\nHowever, because enzymatic functionality requires carefully controlled conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, osmolarity), the description should contain detailed information on reaction controls and the optimum range of operation. Furthermore, the biological source of the enzyme should be provided along with a description of the enzyme's preparation and information about its purity.\n\n5. Reprocessing, Reworking, Recycling, Regeneration, and Salvaging\n\nWhen appropriate, reprocessing, reworking, recycling, regeneration, and salvaging operations should be described. For more detail, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nAppendix C Control of Materials\n\nA list of materials used in the manufacture of fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and drug products should be provided (i.e., the microorganism, cell bank system, media components, solvents, reagents, auxiliary materials). Information pertaining to the quality and control of these materials should also be provided.\n\n1. _Microorganism_Information about the microorganism used for production (i.e., genus, species, and type strain) and known genotypic and phenotypic characteristics should be provided. Additionally, the origin of the source material (or isolate) should be identified or described.\n\n2. Cell Bank System a. Master Cell Bank\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to generate the master cell bank (MCB) and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. The information should include:\n\nMethod, reagents, and media used in preparation\n\nDate of preparation\n\nProcess controls\n\nStorage conditions\n\nProcedures used in testing for relevant phenotypic and genotypic markers and determining culture purity\n\nProcedures used to ensure the absence of contamination from adventitious agents (e.g., microbial contamination and cross-contamination by other cell types) with tests and acceptance criteria specified\n\nb. Working Cell Bank\n\nPreservation of the microbial purity of the MCB is an important factor in maintaining the production strain. Often a working cell bank (WCB) is created so that the MCB will be less likely to be compromised. Creation of a WCB occurs via the propagation of the MCB through defined culture conditions, and then aliquots of the resultant homogenous culture suspension are partitioned into individual storage containers of appropriate size for routine production purposes.\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to derive a WCB from the MCB and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. Information similar to that submitted for the MCB should also be submitted for the WCB.\n\n3. Media Components\n\nA list of the media components used at each stage of the fermentation process should be included in the submission. Specifications should be provided for each component for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose.\n\nIf ruminant-based media components are used in the fermentation process, they should comply with the proposed BSE Medical Products Rule, issued on January 12, 2007 (72 FR 1582).\n\nAll animal-derived components should be identified and appropriate mitigation steps taken to prevent the transmission of adventitious agents.\n\n4. Solvents, Reagents, Auxiliary Materials\n\nA list of solvents, reagents, and other auxiliary materials used in the fermentation process should be provided. Specifications for each material should be included for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose. When water is used in the process, it should be of an appropriate quality for its intended use.\n\nControl of Critical Steps and Intermediates\n\nAll critical process controls and their associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria should be identified and justified and a brief description of the test provided. Furthermore, any experimental data to support the justification should be included.\n\nGood controls are essential during fermentation to ensure product consistency.\n\nEnd product testing alone is not adequate for demonstrating a fermentation process is under control.\n\nManufacturing processes, including fermentation, should be controlled to ensure that the product meets previously identified quality attributes.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #216 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Information - Fermentation-Derived Intermediates, Drug Substances, and Related Drug Products for Veterinary Medicinal Use \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5638644695281982", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Demonstration of state of control with the modified/changed manufacturing process might include, but is not limited to, such items as:\n\nEstablishment of modified specifications for raw, source and starting materials, and reagents;\n\nAppropriate bioburden and/or viral safety testing of the postchange cell banks and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age for production;\n\nAdventitious agent clearance;\n\nRemoval of product- or process-related impurities, such as residual host cell DNA and proteins; and\n\nMaintenance of the purity level.\n\nFor approved products, an appropriate number of postchange batches should be analyzed to demonstrate consistent performance of the process.\n\nTo support the analysis of the changes and the control strategy, the manufacturer should prepare a description of the change that summarizes the prechange and the postchange manufacturing process and that clearly highlights modifications of the process and changes in controls in a side-by-side format.\n\nDemonstration of Comparability During Development (2.4)\n\nDuring product development, it is expected that multiple changes in the manufacturing process will occur that could impact drug product quality, safety, and efficacy. Comparability exercises are generally performed to demonstrate that nonclinical and clinical data generated with prechange product are applicable to postchange product in order to facilitate further development and, ultimately, to support the marketing authorization. Comparability studies conducted for products in development are influenced by factors such as the stage of product development, the availability of validated analytical procedures, and the extent of product and process knowledge, which are limited at times due to the available experience that the manufacturer has with the process.\n\nWhere changes are introduced in development before nonclinical studies, the issue of assessing comparability is not generally raised because the manufacturer subsequently conducts\n\nnonclinical and clinical studies using the postchange product as part of the development process. During early phases of nonclinical and clinical studies, comparability testing is generally not as extensive as for an approved product. As knowledge and information accumulate, and the analytical tools develop, the comparability exercise should utilize available information and will generally become more comprehensive. Where process changes are introduced in late stages of development and no additional clinical studies are planned to support the marketing\n\nauthorization, the comparability exercise should be as comprehensive and thorough as one\n\nconducted for an approved product. Some outcomes of the comparability studies on quality attributes can lead to additional nonclinical or clinical studies.\n\nIn order for a comparability exercise to occur during development, appropriate assessment tools should be used. Analytical procedures used during development might not be validated, but should always be scientifically sound and provide results that are reliable and reproducible. Due to the limitations of the analytical tools in early clinical development, physicochemical and biological tests alone might be considered inadequate to determine comparability; therefore, bridging nonclinical and/or clinical studies, as appropriate, might be needed.\n\nNonclinical and Clinical Considerations (2.5)\n\n2.5.1 Factors To Be Considered in Planning Nonclinical and Clinical Studies (2.5.1)\n\nDeterminations of product comparability can be based solely on quality considerations (see section 2.2) if the manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies as suggested in this document. Additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is considered appropriate when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability. The extent and nature of nonclinical and clinical studies will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consideration of various factors, which include among others:\n\nQuality findings\n\nDrug product -- The type, nature, and extent of differences between the postchange product and the prechange product with respect to quality attributes including product-related substances, the impurity profile, stability, and excipients. For example, new impurities could warrant toxicological studies for qualification;\n\nResults of the evaluation/validation studies on the new process including the results of relevant in-process tests;\n\nAvailability, capabilities, and limitations of tests used for any comparability studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe nature and the level of knowledge of the product\n\nProduct complexity, including heterogeneity and higher order structure -- Physicochemical and in vitro biological assays might not be able to detect all differences in structure and/or function;\n\nStructure-activity relationship and strength of the association of quality attributes with safety and efficacy;\n\nRelationship between the therapeutic protein and endogenous proteins and the consequences for immunogenicity;\n\nMode(s) of action (unknown vs. known, single vs. multiple active sites).\n\nExisting nonclinical and clinical data relevant to the product, aspects of product use, and product class\n\nTherapeutic indications/target patient groups -- The impact of possible differences can vary between patient groups, e.g., risk for unintended immunogenicity. It may be appropriate to consider the consequences separately for each indication;\n\nPosology, e.g., dosing regimen, route of administration -- The risk of certain possible consequences of a difference, such as immunogenicity, could be higher with chronic administration as compared to short-term administration; subcutaneous administration might induce immunogenicity more often than intravenous administration;\n\nThe therapeutic window/dose-response curve -- The impact of a certain change could be different for products that have a wide therapeutic window as compared to those with a more narrow window. The safety or efficacy of products with a steep or a bell-shaped dose-response curve can be affected by minor changes in pharmacokinetics or receptor-binding;\n\nPrevious experience, e.g., immunogenicity, safety -- The experience with the original product or with other products in the same class can be relevant, especially with regard to rare adverse effects, e.g., knowledge about the consequences of immunogenicity;\n\nPharmacokine (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relation, distribution, clearance.\n\n2.2.2 Type of Studies (2.5.2)\n\nThe nonclinical and clinical studies referred to in this document might include, depending on the situation, PK studies, PD studies, PK/PD studies, clinical efficacy studies, specific safety studies, immunogenicity studies, and pharmacovigilance studies. The purpose of these studies is to enable comparison of pre- and postchange product. Where appropriate, these studies should be direct comparative studies.\n\nGLOSSARY (3)\n\nComparability Bridging Study: A study performed to provide nonclinical or clinical data that allows extrapolation of the existing data from the drug product produced by the current process to the drug product from the changed process.\n\nComparable: A conclusion that products have highly similar quality attributes before and after manufacturing process changes and that no adverse impact on the safety or efficacy, including immunogenicity, of the drug product occurred. This conclusion can be based on an analysis of product quality attributes. In some cases, nonclinical or clinical data might contribute to the conclusion.\n\nComparability Exercise: The activities, including study design, conduct of studies, and evaluation of data, that are designed to investigate whether the products are comparable.\n\nQuality Attribute: A molecular or product characteristic that is selected for its ability to help indicate the quality of the product. Collectively, the quality attributes define identity, purity, potency, and stability of the product, and safety with respect to adventitious agents.\n\nSpecifications measure a selected subset of the quality attributes.\n\nReferences (4)\n\nViral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived From Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin (Q5A).\n\nQuality of Biotechnological Products: Analysis of the Expression Construct in Cells Used for Production of r-DNA Derived Protein Products (Q5B).\n\nQuality of Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products (Q5C).\n\nQuality of Biotechnological Products: Derivation and Characterization of Cell Substrates Used for Production of Biotechnological/Biological Products (Q5D).\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products (Q6B).\n\nGood Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (Q7A).\n\nText on Validation of Analytical Procedures (Q2A).\n\nValidation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology (Q2B).\n\nCommon Technical Document for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (M4Q).\n\nStability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products (Q1AR).\n\nP Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (S6).\n\nStatistical Principles for Clinical Trials (E9).\n\nChoice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials (E10).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological:Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5689456462860107", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nComparability Protocols\n\nfor Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4th Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo()fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: ocod()fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information-biologics/biologics-guidances\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOctober 2022\n\nPharmaceutical Quality/CMC\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations or issues for industry to consider regarding a CP for manufacturing process changes that may affect the structure of the drug substance?

With the exception of the discussion in section V regarding submission of certain modifications to an approved comparability protocol in a changes being effected supplement or annual report,2 it does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nFootnote 2: This limited portion of the guidance has a binding effect on the FDA and holders of approved NDAs, ANDAs, and BLAs, pursuant to section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as implemented in 21 CFR 314.70 for NDAs and 601.12 for BLAs.

Also, see definitions of \u201cdrug product\u201d and \u201cbiological product\u201d in 21 CFR 314.3 and 600.3, respectively.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis final guidance is intended to assist original applicants and holders of approved new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and biologics license applications (BLAs) with implementing a chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) postapproval change through the use of a comparability protocol (CP).3 A CP is a comprehensive, prospectively written plan for assessing the effect of a proposed postapproval CMC change(s) on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a drug product, including a biological product (i.e., product),4 as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product (i.e., product quality).5,6\n\nFootnote 5: In this guidance, \u201cproduct quality\u201d refers to the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a product, as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nFootnote 6: See also section 506A(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 356a(b)) and the definitions for \u201cassess the effects of the change\u201d in 21 CFR 314.3 and 600.3.\n\nSubmission of a CP in an original application or in a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an approved application allows FDA to review a description of one or more proposed CMCpostapproval changes, any supporting information and analysis, including a risk assessment, a plan to implement the change(s), and, if appropriate, a proposed reduced reporting category for the change(s). Approval of the original application or a subsequent PAS containing the CP provides an agreed-upon plan to implement the specified change(s), and in many cases, a justification to report the change(s) in a reduced reporting category, contingent upon your analysis of the data from the implementation of the change(s). In many cases, submission and approval of a CP will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution or facilitating a proactive approach to reinforcing the supply of the product sooner than if a CP were not used. The drivers for such changes include business needs, expanding markets, process improvements, potential for drug shortage, and accelerated manufacturing development that sometimes occurs with drugs eligible for expedited programs.7\n\nFootnote 7: See FDA guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions \u2013 Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).

However, this guidance is not applicable to blood and blood components; biological products that also meet the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act); or human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR part 1271. Recommendations for the use of CPs by manufacturers of licensed blood and blood components are included in a separate FDA guidance for industry on Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products: Human Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion or for Further Manufacture (December 2014). The scope of this guidance does not include animal drugs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.17028284072876"], "Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency's reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase \"mixtures of articles and carriers\" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing \"cold\" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological's thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered \"raw data\" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes \"studies in progress on June 20, 1979\" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2763085663318634", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 5: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nThe control strategy provided in the application should include a proposal for use of alternative testing or monitoring approaches in cases of equipment failure. The alternative approach could involve use of end-product testing or other options, while maintaining an acceptable level of quality. Testing or monitoring equipment breakdown should be managed in the context of a deviation under the quality system and can be covered by GMP inspection. (Approved June 2009)\n\nAre product specifications different for minimal versus QbD approaches?\n\nIn principle no, product specifications are the same for minimal and QbD approaches. For a QbD approach, the control strategy can facilitate achieving the end product specifications via real time release testing approaches (see ICH Q8(R2) Annex, appendix 1). Product must meet specification, when tested.6 (Approved October 2009)\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System (3)\n\nQ1: What are the benefits of implementing a pharmaceutical quality system (PQS) (in accordance with ICH Q10)?\n\nThe benefits are:\n\nFacilitated robustness of the manufacturing process, through facilitation of continual improvement through science and risk-based postapproval change processes\n\nConsistency in the global pharmaceutical environment across regions\n\nEnable transparency of systems, processes, and organizational and management responsibility\n\nClearer understanding of the application of a quality system throughout product lifecycle\n\nFurther reducing risk of product failure and incidence of complaints and recalls, thereby providing greater assurance of pharmaceutical product consistency and availability (supply) to the patient\n\nBetter process performance\n\nOpportunity to increase understanding between industry and regulators and more optimal use of industry and regulatory resources; enhance manufacturer's and regulators' confidence in product quality\n\nIncreased compliance with GMPs, which builds confidence in the regulators and may result in shorter inspections (Approved April 2009)\n\nHow does a company demonstrate implementation of PQS in accordance with ICH Q10?\n\nWhen implemented, a company will demonstrate the use of an effective PQS through its documentation (e.g., policies, standards), its processes, its training/qualification, its management, its continual improvement efforts, and its performance against pre-defined key performance indicators (see ICH Q10 glossary on performance indicator).\n\nA mechanism should be established to demonstrate at a site how the PQS operates across the product lifecycle, in an easily understandable way for management, staff, and regulatory inspectors, e.g., a quality manual, documentation, flowcharts, procedures. Companies can implement a program in which the PQS is routinely audited in-house (i.e., internal audit program) to ensure that the system is functioning at a high level. (Approved April 2009)\n* Is it necessary to describe the PQS in a regulatory submission?\n* No, however relevant elements of the PQS (such as quality monitoring system, change control, and deviation management) can be referenced as part of the control strategy as supporting information. (Approved April 2009)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ4:: Will there be certification that the PQS is in accordance with ICH Q10?\n\nA4: No. There will not be a specific ICH Q10 certification program. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ5:: How should the implementation of the design space be evaluated during inspection of the manufacturing site?\n\nA5: Inspection should verify/assess that manufacturing operations are appropriately carried out within the design space. The inspector in collaboration with the assessor, where appropriate, should also verify successful manufacturing operations under the design space and that movement within the design space is managed within the company's change management system (see ICH Q10, section IV. B.3 (3.2), Table III). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ6:: What should be done if manufacturing operations run inadvertently outside of the design space?\n\nA6: This should be handled as a deviation under GMP. For example, unplanned \"one-off\" excursions occurring as a result of unexpected events, such as operator error or equipment failure, would be investigated, documented, and dealt with as a deviation in the usual way. The results of the investigation could contribute to the process knowledge, preventive actions, and continual improvement of the product. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ7:: What information and documentation of the development studies should be available at a manufacturing site?\n\nA7: Pharmaceutical development information (e.g., supporting information on design space, chemometric model, risk management) is available at the development site. Pharmaceutical development information that is useful to ensure the understanding of the basis for the manufacturing process and control strategy, including the rationale for selection of critical process parameters and critical quality attributes, should be available at the manufacturing site. Scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing between pharmaceutical development and manufacturing is essential to ensure the successful transfer to production. (Approved June 2009)\n\nQ8:: Can process parameters be adjusted throughout the product lifecycle?\n\nA8: Process parameters are studied and selected during pharmaceutical development and monitored during commercial manufacturing. Knowledge gained could be utilized for adjustment of the parameters as part of continual improvement of the process throughout the lifecycle of the drug product (see ICH Q10, section IV (3)). (Approved June 2009)\n\nImpact of New ICH Quality Guidance on GMP Inspection Practices (4)\n\nQ1: How will product-related inspections differ in an ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10 environment?\n\nIn the case of product-related inspection (in particular, preauthorization) depending on the complexity of the product and/or process, greater collaboration between inspectors and assessors could be helpful (for example, for the assessment of development data). The inspection would normally occur at the proposed commercial manufacturing site, and there is likely to be greater focus on enhanced process understanding and understanding relationships, e.g., critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters (CPPs). The inspection might also focus on the application and implementation of quality risk management principles, as supported by the pharmaceutical quality system (PQS). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ2: How will system-related inspections differ in an ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 environment?\n\nThe inspection process will remain similar. However, upon the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10, inspections will have greater focus on (but not only focus on) how the PQS facilitates the use of e.g., quality risk management methods, implementation of design space, and change management (see ICH Q10). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ3: How is control strategy approved in the application and evaluated during inspection?\n\nElements of control strategy submitted in the application will be reviewed and approved by the regulatory agency. However, additional elements are subject to inspection (as described in Q10). (Approved October 2009)\n\nKnowledge Management (5)\n\nHow has the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 changed the significance and use of knowledge management?\n\nQ10 defines knowledge management as: \"Systematic approach to acquiring, analyzing, storing, and disseminating information related to products, manufacturing processes and components.\" Knowledge management is not a system; it enables the implementation of the concepts described in ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nKnowledge management is not a new concept. It is always important regardless of the development approach. Q10 highlights knowledge management because it is expected that more complex information generated by appropriate approaches (e.g., QbD, process analytical technology (PAT), real-time data generation, and control monitoring systems) should be better captured, managed, and shared during product life-cycle.\n\nIn conjunction with quality risk management, knowledge management can facilitate the use of concepts such as prior knowledge (including from other similar products), development of design space, control strategy, technology transfer, and continual improvement across the product life cycle. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ2:: Does Q10 suggest an ideal way to manage knowledge?\n\nA2: No. Q10 provides a framework and does not prescribe how to implement knowledge management. Each company decides how to manage knowledge, including the depth and extent of information assessment based on its specific needs. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ3:: What are potential sources of information for knowledge management?\n\nA3: Some examples of knowledge sources are:\n\nPrior knowledge based on experience obtained from similar processes (internal knowledge, industry scientific and technical publications) and published information (external knowledge: literature and peer-reviewed publications)\n\nPharmaceutical development studies\n\nMechanism of action\n\nStructure/function relationships\n\nTechnology transfer activities\n\nProcess validation studies\n\nManufacturing experience, e.g., -- Internal and vendor audits -- Raw material testing data\n\nInnovation\n\nContinual improvement\n\nChange management activities\n\nStability reports\n\nProduct quality reviews/annual product reviews\n\nComplaint reports\n\nAdverse event reports (patient safety)\n\nDeviation reports, recall Information\n\nTechnical investigations and/or CAPA reports\n\nSuppliers and contractors* Product history and /or manufacturing history\n\nOngoing manufacturing processes information (e.g., trends)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q8, Q9, and Q10 Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.0147149562835693", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Questions and Answers\n\nTHE GLP REGULATIONS - GENERAL\n\nDo the GLPs require the establishment of Technical Operation Manuals?\n\nNo.\n\nIf a laboratory is accredited by AAALAC (American Association for Accreditation of\n\nLaboratory Animal Care), does this serve as assurance of meeting the GLP\n\nrequirements for animal care and facilities?\n\nAAALAC accreditation does not substitute for Agency inspection nor does it guarantee\n\nautomatic compliance with the applicable GLP sections. It is of value, however, in that\n\nit demonstrates that the facility has favorably passed a peer group review.\n\nResults of the quality assurance unit inspections are not routinely available to an\n\nAgency investigator. However, the conforming amendments require that GLP\n\ndeviations are to be reported in detail with each submission to the FDA. Are we\n\nrequired to send the contents of the quality assurance unit inspection report to the\n\nFDA?\n\nNo. The GLP compliance statement in the conforming amendments to the GLPs was\n\nincluded for several reasons:\n\n(a) to provide an orderly transition across the effective date of the regulations. It was\n\nunderstood that applications for research and marketing permits submitted to the\n\nAgency for some period of time after the GLP effective date of June 20, 1979, would\n\ncontain final reports of nonclinical studies begun and completed prior to the effective date, begun prior to the effective date and completed thereafter, and begun and completed after the effective date. Studies begun and completed prior to the effective date are not required to comply with the GLPs and accordingly, the conforming amendments require that differences be noted. Similar considerations apply to studies begun prior to and completed after the effective date, although in these studies, those portions underway as of the effective date are required to comply.\n\n(b) to provide for the submission of final reports of studies, which were not required to comply with the GLPs but which otherwise, contribute to safety evaluation. The GLPs do not apply to safety studies conducted by independent investigators studying regulated products. Such studies are not sponsored by the product manufacturer, nor is there any intention to submit the results to the Agency. The study results are published in the open literature. The sponsor is required red to submit the study to the Agency but could in no way control the research. If the sponsor wishes to use the data in support of the application, the conforming amendments provide a mechanism by which the sponsor can prove that the study was not compromised. A similar situation exists for preliminary exploratory safety studies done by the sponsor.\n\n(c) to foster GLP compliance attitudes by management. The conforming amendment causes management to act responsively to all cases of GLP non-compliance and to take prompt corrective actions.\n\nWith these purposes in mind, the conforming amendments require a brief statement of overall GLP compliance and need not contain the Quality Assurance Unit findings. The Quality Assurance Unit findings should cover short-term GLP deviations, which are promptly corrected. The conforming amendments statement should cover those systematic GLP deviations which have occurred throughout the study.\n\nWho provides the GLP compliance statement required by the conforming amendments?\n\nThis statement is provided by the applicant for the research or marketing permit.\n\nWhat is the degree of compliance with GLPs, which the FDA will require for INDs submitted after June 20, 1979, but which include toxicology studies initiated before June 20, 1979, and completed after June 20, 1979?\n\nThose portions of the studies underway as of the effective date will have to be done in accord with the applicable provisions of the GLPs.\n\nDo nonclinical laboratory studies completed *prior to June 20, 1979 but submitted as part of an IND or NDA subsequent to that date fall under the conforming amendments?\n\nThese studies would not have to have been conducted under the GLPs but the conforming amendment statement of compliance is required.\n\nHow many members of the National Association of Life Science Industries (NALSI) come under the GLPs? How can the membership list be obtained?The Agency has not compiled such a list. A membership list is available from NALSI, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 2oOo6. All members who conduct nonclinical laboratory studies are subject to the GLPs.\n\nShould a contract laboratory ask a sponsor if the article they are testing is subject to FDA regulations? Should these studies then be listed as a separate master list of studies to comply with the GLP regulations? Contract laboratories should ask sponsors to identify studies which are associated with FDA regulated products, although the GLPs place this responsibility on the sponsor. A separate listing of such studies, apart from the firm's master list of all studies undertaken by the firm will satisfy the requirements of the GLPs.\n\nWhat impact have the GLP regulations had on the cost of performing toxicology studies? The president of a large contracting laboratory has stated that three years ago a chronic rat study could be done for about $8o,0oo; and that the current cost is closer $250,000. He estimated that half of the increased cost is due to GLPs, 30% to larger numbers of test animals per study on present day protocols and 20% to inflation. The Agency has not developed cost estimates.\n\n58.1 Scope\n\n58.3 Definitionsapplicability to Studies Performed Under Grants and Contracts\n\n58.15 Inspection of a Testing Facility\n\nAre short-term microbiological screening tests and microbiological preservative stability research and development covered by the GLPs? Microbiological preservative stability research, development and quality control tests are not covered by the GLPs. However, microbiological tests conducted to establish the toxicological profile of an article are covered.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit analytical data collected on a test article? Yes, insofar as it contributes to the evaluation of a nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit draft final protocols and draft final reports? The regulations do not require that such materials be retained, however, if draft reports are available, they may be audited in order to help the Agency follow the process from raw data to final report.\n\nExplain why the GLPs apply to \"microorganisms or subparts thereof.\" How are microorganisms currently used by FDA in assessment of safety? For certain products, FDA does request that microbial tests be done for the purpose of obtaining information on potential neoplastic and mutagenic activity. Likewise, microsomal preparations (subparts thereof) are used as activating systems for certain in vitro tests. When this happens, the tests should be done in accord with the GLPs.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to engineering/electronic testing laboratories that perform functionality tests on medical devices? No.\n\nIs a licensed manufacturer of human biological products subject to continuing GLP inspection? The GLPs apply to safety studies submitted to the Agency in order to obtain the license. They do not apply to such studies conducted for the purpose of obtaining batch release of licensed biologicals.\n\nWill nonclinical studies in support of medical devices which do not come in contact with man (e.g., stopcocks, a gas machine, a urine bag) be subject to the GLP regulations? If the medical device application for a research or marketing permit does not require the submission of safety data for approval, then the GLPs do not apply.\n\nIf a test article is produced by microbial fermentation, are tests run on the bacteria, such as pathogenicity or virulence covered by the GLPs? No.\n\nAre studies performed for label purposes as required by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act considered to be nonclinical laboratory studies under the GLPs? No.\n\nWhen an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving \"diagnostic products\" and \"medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man\" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.3653318881988525", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: For the purposes of this guidance, the product lifecycle includes the following technical activities for new and existing products:\n\nPharmaceutical Development\n\nDrug substance development\n\nFormulation development (including container/closure system)\n\nManufacture of investigational products\n\nDelivery system development (where relevant)\n\nManufacturing process development and scale-up\n\nAnalytical method development\n\nTechnology Transfer\n\nNew product transfers during development through manufacturing\n\nTransfers within or between manufacturing and testing sites for marketed products\n\nCommercial Manufacturing\n\nAcquisition and control of materials\n\nProvision of facilities, utilities, and equipment\n\nProduction (including packaging and labeling)\n\nQuality control and assurance\nDistribution (excluding wholesaler activities)\n\nProduct Discontinuation\n\nRetention of documentation\n\nSample retention\n\nContinued product assessment and reporting\n\nB. Relationship of ICH Q10 to Regional GMP Requirements, ISO Standards, and ICH Q7 (1.3)\n\nRegional GMP requirements, the ICH guidance \"Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients,\" and ISO quality management system guidelines form the foundation for ICH Q10. To meet the objectives described below, ICH Q10 augments GMPs by describing specific quality system elements and management responsibilities. ICH Q10 provides a harmonized model for a pharmaceutical quality system throughout the lifecycle of a product and is intended to be used together with regional GMP requirements.\n\nThe regional GMPs do not explicitly address all stages of the product lifecycle (e.g., development). The quality system elements and management responsibilities described in this guidance are intended to encourage the use of science- and risk-based approaches at each lifecycle stage, thereby promoting continual improvement across the entire product lifecycle.\n\n3 Relationship of ICH Q10 to Regulatory Approaches (1.4)\n\nRegulatory approaches for a specific product or manufacturing facility should be commensurate with the level of product and process understanding, the results of quality risk management, and the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality system. When implemented, the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality system can normally be evaluated during a regulatory inspection at the manufacturing site. Potential opportunities to enhance science- and risk-based regulatory approaches are identified in Annex 1. Regulatory processes will be determined by region.\n\n4 ICH Q10 Objectives (1.5)\n\nImplementation of the Q10 model should result in achievement of three main objectives that complement or enhance regional GMP requirements.\n\n1.1 Achieve Product Realization (1.5.1)\n\nTo establish, implement, and maintain a system that allows the delivery of products with the quality attributes appropriate to meet the needs of patients, health care professionals, regulatory authorities (including compliance with approved regulatory filings) and other internal and external customers.\nTo develop and use effective monitoring and control systems for process performance and product quality, thereby providing assurance of continued suitability and capability of processes. Quality risk management can be useful in identifying the monitoring and control systems.\n\n1.2.3 Facilitate Continual Improvement (1.5.3)\n\nTo identify and implement appropriate product quality improvements, process improvements, variability reduction, innovations, and pharmaceutical quality system enhancements, thereby increasing the ability to fulfill a pharmaceutical manufacturer's own quality needs consistently. Quality risk management can be useful for identifying and prioritizing areas for continual improvement.\n\n1.5 Enablers: Knowledge Management and Quality Risk Management (1.6)\n\nUse of knowledge management and quality risk management will enable a company to implement ICH Q10 effectively and successfully. These enablers will facilitate achievement of the objectives described in section 1.2.3 above by providing the means for science- and risk-based decisions related to product quality.\n\n1.5.1 Knowledge Management (1.6.1)\n\nProduct and process knowledge should be managed from development through the commercial life of the product up to and including product discontinuation. For example, development activities using scientific approaches provide knowledge for product and process understanding. Knowledge management is a systematic approach to acquiring, analyzing, storing, and disseminating information related to products, manufacturing processes, and components. Sources of knowledge include, but are not limited to, prior knowledge (public domain or internally documented); pharmaceutical development studies; technology transfer activities; process validation studies over the product lifecycle; manufacturing experience; innovation; continual improvement; and change management activities.\n\n1.5.2 Quality Risk Management (1.6.2)\n\nQuality risk management is integral to an effective pharmaceutical quality system. It can provide a proactive approach to identifying, scientifically evaluating, and controlling potential risks to quality. It facilitates continual improvement of process performance and product quality throughout the product lifecycle. ICH Q9 provides principles and examples of tools for quality risk management that can be applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality.\n\n1.6 Design and Content Considerations (1.7)\n\nThe design, organization, and documentation of the pharmaceutical quality system should be well structured and clear to facilitate common understanding and consistent application.\n\nThe elements of ICH Q10 should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognizing the different goalsand knowledge available for each stage. 3. The size and complexity of the company's activities should be taken into consideration when developing a new pharmaceutical quality system or modifying an existing one. The design of the pharmaceutical quality system should incorporate appropriate risk management principles. While some aspects of the pharmaceutical quality system can be company wide and others site specific, the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality system is normally demonstrated at the site level. 4. The pharmaceutical quality system should include appropriate processes, resources, and responsibilities to provide assurance of the quality of outsourced activities and purchased materials as described in section III.G (2.7). 5. Management responsibilities, as described in section III (2), should be identified within the pharmaceutical quality system. 6. The pharmaceutical quality system should include the following elements, as described in section IV (3): process performance and product quality monitoring, corrective and preventive action, change management, and management review. 7. Performance indicators, as described in section V (4), should be identified and used to monitor the effectiveness of processes within the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nQuality Manual (1.8)\n\nA Quality Manual or equivalent documentation approach should be established and should contain the description of the pharmaceutical quality system. The description should include:\n\nThe quality policy (see section III (2)). 2. The scope of the pharmaceutical quality system. 3. Identification of the pharmaceutical quality system processes, as well as their sequences, linkages, and interdependencies. Process maps and flow charts can be useful tools to facilitate depicting pharmaceutical quality system processes in a visual manner. 4. Management responsibilities within the pharmaceutical quality system (see section III (2)).\n\nIII Management Responsibility (2)\n\nLeadership is essential to establish and maintain a company-wide commitment to quality and for the performance of the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nManagement Commitment (2.1)\n\nSenior management has the ultimate responsibility to ensure an effective pharmaceutical quality system is in place to achieve the quality objectives, and that roles, responsibilities, and authorities are defined, communicated, and implemented throughout the company.\n\nManagement should: 1. Participate in the design, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of an effective pharmaceutical quality system. 2. Demonstrate strong and visible support for the pharmaceutical quality system and ensure its implementation throughout their organization. 3. Ensure a timely and effective communication and escalation process exists to raise quality issues to the appropriate levels of management. 4. Define individual and collective roles, responsibilities, authorities, and interrelationships of all organizational units related to the pharmaceutical quality system. Ensure these interactions are communicated and understood at all levels of the organization. An independent quality unit/structure with authority to fulfill certain pharmaceutical quality system responsibilities is required by regional regulations. 5. Conduct management reviews of process performance and product quality and of the pharmaceutical quality system. 6. Advocate continual improvement. 7. Commit appropriate resources.\n\nQuality Policy (2.2)\n\nSenior management should establish a quality policy that describes the overall intentions and direction of the company related to quality.\n\nThe quality policy should include an expectation to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and should facilitate continual improvement of the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nThe quality policy should be communicated to and understood by personnel at all levels in the company.\n\nThe quality policy should be reviewed periodically for continuing effectiveness.\n\nQuality Planning (2.3)\n\nSenior management should ensure the quality objectives to implement the quality policy are defined and communicated.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.381442070007324", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Is the master schedule sheet intended to be prospective or historical? If it is historical, what is the required retention period?\n\nThe master schedule sheet is intended to include a listing of all nonclinical laboratory studies currently in progress as well as those which have been conducted during the terms specified in section 58.195 of the GLPs.\n* Does the master schedule sheet have to list studies on compounds for which no data has yet been submitted to the Agency?\n\nYes. The GLPs cover all nonclinical laboratory studies of Agency regulated products that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits.\n* The GLPs state that the quality assurance unit should assure that the final report reflects the study results. Is it required that every final report be reviewed by the quality assurance unit?\n\nYes. This procedure helps to ensure the accuracy of the final report.\n* Does the quality assurance unit review of each final study report have to be reported to management?\n\nYes. The quality assurance unit must make periodic reports to management and the study director on each study. These reports should include the results of the final report review.\n* At our facility the quality assurance unit reports directly to the executive vice president of the company and not to the vice president of research and development. Is it necessary for us to formulate a separate quality assurance unit within the research and development department?The GLPs require that the quality assurance unit director and the study director cannot be the same person. The quality assurance unit must report to a level of management that has the authority to effect the corrective action as indicated by the quality assurance unit inspection reports. How this is accomplished organizationally is a management prerogative.\n17. Is it acceptable for the quality assurance unit to report to the management person who is also responsible for drug safety evaluation? This is acceptable provided that the management person is not the study director for the studies being inspected by the quality assurance unit.\n18. Is it permissible to have a pharmacologist in the research division serve as the director of the quality assurance unit? The GLPs state that a person may not perform both quality assurance functions and study direction and conduct functions for the same study. Thus, a pharmacologist in a research division could serve as the director of the quality assurance unit as long as he or she did not otherwise participate in the studies under review by the quality assurance unit.\n19. How is the requirement for a quality assurance unit to be interpreted when the testing facility is itself a quality assurance unit? By definition, a testing facility could not be a quality assurance unit. A quality assurance unit, which conducts nonclinical laboratory studies, should make separate provision for the performance of the GLP quality assurance functions.\n20. Is a member of the statistical department of a testing facility entitled to be a member of the quality assurance unit? This decision rests with facility management but such a choice is acceptable.\n21. Company A is conducting a study. Company B performs animal work for Company A to the extent of implanting test material, recovering test materials and tissues, and returning these to Company A for analysis and conclusions. Which company is designated as the testing facility, which company designates the study director, and which company does the study director work for? In the cited example, Company A would be the study sponsor while Company B would be a contract laboratory performing a portion of a nonclinical laboratory study. Both companies would be considered testing facilities, but, since the GLPs require a single study director for each study, Company A would designate the study director. Company B would, no doubt, designate a participating scientist in charge of the animal work and would have the responsibility of submitting a participating scientist's report to Company A for inclusion into the final report.\n* Is it acceptable to have two study directors for a single study at the same time?\n\nNo. The regulations require a single point of study control, which has been vested in the study director.\n* Do the GLPs permit the designation of a \"deputy\" or \"acting\" study director to be in charge of a nonclinical laboratory study when the study director is out of town, on vacation, etc.?\n\nYes.\n* Must the study director personally verify all observations made during a nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nNo. The study director must assure that study procedures are adequate to ensure the collection of valid data.\n* A study is only as good as the people who perform it and most importantly as the person who directs it. What does the Agency do to assess the training and experience of toxicologists?\n\nThe assessment of the training and experience of personnel is a routine part of the GLP Compliance Program. Agency investigators collect summaries of training and experience for individuals participating in the study. These summaries are evaluated by the headquarters scientific review staff.\n* In view of the shortage of board certified pathologists, is it permissible to permit either non-veterinarians or non-board certified veterinary pathologists to conduct necropsies? Is certification required for a pathologist to participate in a nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nThe Agency recognizes the serious shortage of trained and certified pathologists as well as toxicologists. The GLPs require that personnel possess the appropriate combination of education, training and experience needed to do their jobs. Therefore, it is permissible to have non-veterinarians conduct necropsies provided their training and experience are adequate. The GLPs do not require board certification for either pathologists or toxicologists.\n\nWhat does the agency consider to be the minimal acceptable educational requirements for someone appointed as \"study director? \" Due to the wide range of nonclinical laboratory studies and the numerous combinations of education, training and experience, which would be acceptable, the Agency did not specify minimal educational requirements for nonclinical laboratory study participants. The GLPs specify that the study director should have the appropriate mixture of education, training and experience to permit the performance of the assigned functions.\n\nWill I, as the director rector of a contract pathology laboratory, be required to have a quality assurance unit and to store slides, blocks, wet tissues, etc. in the archives? The GLPs require that the quality assurance functions be performed. In your case, either you or the sponsor must have a quality assurance unit. Again, either you, the sponsor, or a separate commercial facility will have to store slides, blocks, wet tissues, etc., and the archives will have to specify the storage location.\n\nSUBPART C FACILITIES\n\nGeneral\n\n58.43 AnIMAL CARE FACILITIES\n\n58.45 AnIMAL SUPPLY FACILITIES FOR HANDLIING TEST AND CONTROL ARTICLES\n\n58.49 LABORATORY OPERATION AREAS\n\n58.51 Specim and data storage facilities\n\n58.53 Administrative and Personnel facilities\n\nWould there be any criticism of a laboratory where animals of the same species, used concurrently in 6-8 short-term eye or dermal irritation studies, were housed in the same room, assuming there is sufficient spatial separation? No. This procedure would be acceptable provided that precautions were taken to prevent animal and experimental mix-ups and cross-contamination.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the FDA and the USDA inspection of animal facilities?\n\nThe USDA inspection is directed towards ensuring the humane care of animals used in research whereas the FDA inspection is directed towards ensuring the quality of data obtained from safety experiments that involve animals.\n\nWe feel that storage of test article - diet mixtures in animal rooms in well-labeled, vermin proof containers will lead to fewer errors than storage in a central common area. Is this permissible in light of section 58.47(b)?\n\nYes. Section 58.47(b) requires separate areas for test article diet mixtures, which need not be a separate common area or a separate room. In the cited example, each animal room could have a separate area devoted to feed storage.\n\nIs it necessary to provide space for the isolation of diseased animals if they are immediately removed from the study and sacrificed?\n\nNo. The intent of the regulations is to ensure that diseased animals are handled in a manner that will not adversely impact on the nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nIs it acceptable for a nonclinical laboratory to quarantine all newly arrived animals for the required period and then begin the study in the same area?\n\nYes.\n\n58.61 Equipment Design\n\nMaintenance and Calibration of Equipment\n\nRegarding GLP required standard operating procedures for preventive maintenance, is it expected that detailed instructions be prepared for each piece of laboratory equipment? Can the standard operating procedures refer to an equipment manual for detailed instructions as appropriate?\n\nSpecific standard operating procedures are required for each piece of equipment. These procedures can incorporate verbatim the instructions contained in the equipment manuals.\n\nIn order to calibrate a scale used to weigh large farm animals is it necessary to use a set of standard weights similar to those used for laboratory animal scales only much, much heavier?\n\nIn this case, calibration and maintenance of a periodic nature can be performed by a manufacturer's representative and the records should reflect these operations.\n\nAdditionally, calibration can be accomplished through use of secondary standards.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.519852876663208", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: When an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving \"diagnostic products\" and \"medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man\" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n\nDo engineering laboratory tests done on components of implantable medical devices fall under the GLPs? No.\n\nAre safety tests conducted on biological products exempt from the GLPs? Two kinds of safety tests are performed on human biological products. Those which are performed by the manufacturer prior to licensing, and those performed post licensing. The tests performed prior to licensing establish the basic safety profile of the product and they are covered by the GLPs. The safety tests performed post licensing are part of the required quality control assays, which permit the release of each batch of product. These tests are not covered by the GLPs. Safety testing of interstate biological products for use in animals is not covered by the GLPs since these products are not regulated by FDA.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to veterinary drug and biological manufacturers even when the end products are strictly for veterinary use?\n\nThe GLPs apply to animal drugs used on a prescription basis but they do not apply to interstate veterinary biologists since these products are regulated by USDA. Intrastate veterinary biologists, which are considered to be new animal drugs, are also covered by the GLPs.\n\nIf an organization has separate divisions for basic research and for toxicological safety testing, will the basic research division be subject to inspection under the GLPs? No, as long as the basic research division is not providing any service function for the safety-testing unit.\n\nDo the GLP requirements apply to an equal degree to acute, medium-term, and long-term studies? The GLPs apply equally to all nonclinical laboratory studies. It should be recognized, however, that short-term (less than 6 months) studies need not be inspected as frequently as long term (more than 6 months) studies by the quality assurance unit.\n\nAre preliminary protocol development or design studies that employ laboratory animals covered by the GLPs? No, these are preliminary exploratory studies.\n\nIf an acute oral toxicity study, a 9o-day oral toxicity study, and a two-year chronic study are done, is only the two-year study required to be done under the GLPs? No. Each study, regardless of its duration or complexity should be considered in terms of its purpose. A study, which is conducted for the purpose of estimating the safety of a product in, humans or animals and which will be submitted to FDA, is covered under the GLPs. This includes acute oral toxicity studies as well as 9o-day oral toxicity studies and two-year chronic studies. In early phases of research, acute studies are often used to select the most promising product from a group of candidate products. In this sense acute studies are exploratory or screening in nature and would be exempted from the GLPs. There are also special situations where a 9o-day oral toxicity study or even a chronic oral toxicity study may be exempted from GLPs. For example, a multinational company may want to develop Product A for a very specific foreign market. The company has no intention of ever applying to FDA for an investigational or marketing permit for Product A. Long-term safety studies with Product A for the purpose of foreign registration would be exempted from GLPs.\n\nWill you please ease define a range-finding study and will such studies be inspected? A range-finding study is conducted to gather information such as dose range or toxicological end point to permit the more proper design of a subsequent nonclinical laboratory study. Such studies, which are usually short-term, are preliminary exploratory studies, which are exempt from the GLPs if properly labeled as \"range-finding\" or \"preliminary pilot study\" or similar designation. These studies will usually not serve as the basis of inspection, but may be reviewed to determine whether the operation of a facility is in compliance with the GLPs. Although the studies are exempt from the GLPs, they must still be submitted to the Agency as part of the respective application for a research or marketing permit.\n\nDoes the Agency agree that the GLPs are applicable to safety studies intended for submission to the Agency in support of the approval of a regulated product and that they are not applicable to preliminary exploratory studies, screening studies, and range finding studies whose purpose is to develop or improve the experimental design of a planned nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nYes.\n* Many toxicological studies are conducted on products or formulations, which are comprised entirely of materials which are known to be safe. Such studies are intended to be a quality control measure to determine lack of product integrity or to detect adulteration. Do the GLPs apply to such studies?\n\nNo. The Agency considers such studies to be quality control studies, which are not subject to the GLPs.\n* Does a food manufacturer's laboratory, which conducts only microbiological screening studies, have to comply with the GLPs?\n\nGenerally no. The GLPs apply to safety studies intended for submission to the Agency in support of product approval. Food microbiology studies are quality control studies not subject to the regulations.\n* Do the GLPs apply to laboratories, which perform routine sterility analyses on marketable medical devices, which have been treated with gas for the purpose of sterilization?\n\nNo.\n* Are studies of approved drugs or devices undertaken for physician education, advertising or pharmaceutical marketing purposes subject to the GLPs?\n\nNo.\n* Do the GLPs apply to safety substantiation studies conducted on over-the-counter drugs, which are covered by a final monograph?\n\nNo.\n* It is not clear whether a laboratory involved solely in chemical analysis support of a nonclinical laboratory study would be required to comply with the GLPs. Can this be clarified?\n\nYes. Analytical laboratories must comply with the GLPs to the extent that they provide data, which support the nonclinical laboratory study. Only those portions of the laboratory, those procedures and those personnel involved are required to be in compliance with the GLPs.\n* What is FDA's position regarding the testing of \"medical foods\" according to GLP requirements?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.171369552612305"], "Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: #156\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nComparability Protocols -\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and\n\nControls Information\n\nfor New Animal Drugs\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.614527702331543", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Recommendations for executed (completed) batch records are provided in CVM guidance for industry [42]: Animal Drug Manufacturing Guidelines-Series of Four Guidelines (1994). CVM encourages the submission of executed batch records for lots of drug substance and drug product used in support of the application as they provide valuable detail and insight into the manufacturing process and proposed controls.\n\na.1.1 Pharmaceutical Development Reports\n\nSponsors are encouraged to provide pharmaceutical development reports (PDRs) that describe the scientific rationale for the chosen manufacturing process(es) and controls for fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and related drug products. A sponsor's ability to demonstrate process understanding can be factored into CVM's risk-based decision making (e.g., Pre-Approval Inspection Decision Support System (PAIDSS)). Suggestions for PDRs can be found in ICH Q8: Pharmaceutical Development.\n\na.1.2 Cell Growth (Propagation) and Harvest\n\nA description should be provided that includes a flow diagram illustrating each step in propagation from the original inoculum (e.g., cells from one or more vials of the working cell bank) through the last harvesting operation.\n\nAll steps should be included along with the relevant information, such as the growth conditions and in-process tests performed (e.g., cell concentrations, volumes, pH, cultivation times, temperatures).\n\nCritical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with sampling plans and testing time points.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe flow diagram can be supplemented with information presented in tabular form, if appropriate.\n\nA narrative describing each manufacturing step in the process should accompany the flow diagram:\n\nIdentify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria\n\nHighlight any process controls that are considered critical\n\nIdentify the intended scale of the process. The amounts indicated should be representative of a maximum-sized production batch.\n\nWe recommend the following be included in the narrative:\n\nA description of the major equipment involved in each step\n\nA description of inoculation and each step in propagation with growth conditions specified\n\nThe composition of the media used at each step, including water quality and additives used\n\nThe sterilization procedures for media (e.g. a batch sterilization process or continuous system)\n\nThe equipment (e.g. fermentation vessel), feeds, and other materials added during the fermentation process\n\nProcess parameters monitored and controls for critical steps and intermediates\n\nProcedures used to transfer material between steps\n\nProcedures used to minimize contamination by adventitious agents\n\nProcess controls to confirm the effectiveness of the specific manufacturing steps used to inactivate and or remove adventitious agents\n\nCriteria for harvesting\n\nCriteria for rejecting/accepting a fermentation batch if contamination occurs\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nCriteria for pooling more than one harvest, if applicable\n\nStorage conditions and time limits if the harvested crude fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n3. Purification and Downstream Processing\n\nThe description should include a flow diagram that illustrates and a narrative that describes all the steps involved in isolating and purifying the crude fermentation product to its final form, along with any relevant information (e.g., volumes, pH, temperatures, holding times). Critical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with testing time points.\n\nThe narrative describing each manufacturing step should accompany the flow diagram and should identify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria and include the following:\n\nMethods used in purification or separation of the crude fermentation product (e.g. precipitation, centrifugation, filtration) including major equipment (e.g. columns, membranes* Process parameters monitored\n\nThe in-process controls and analytical tests used to show identity, purity, and concentration and to evaluate levels of process- and product-related impurities\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nPrecautions taken to prevent or control microbial contamination during purification\n\nConditions for reuse and/or procedures for regeneration of columns, membranes, and adsorbents\n\nStorage conditions and time limits, if the purified fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n4. Modification Reactions (If Applicable)\n\nChemical Modifications\n\nWhen a product of fermentation is to be subjected to further molecular change through chemical means, a description of the synthetic steps should be included in the procedural narrative.\n\nAdditionally, a flow diagram of the synthetic process should be provided. For more details, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nEnzymatic Modifications\n\nWhen the fermentation product is further modified using enzyme catalysts, the steps should be included in the flow diagram and detailed in the procedural narrative. Enzymatic reactions are considered chemical reactions since the conversion of substrate product involves breaking and forming chemical bonds. Thus, much of the information submitted in the manufacturing description should be the same as that submitted for chemical processes (drug substance).\n\nHowever, because enzymatic functionality requires carefully controlled conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, osmolarity), the description should contain detailed information on reaction controls and the optimum range of operation. Furthermore, the biological source of the enzyme should be provided along with a description of the enzyme's preparation and information about its purity.\n\n5. Reprocessing, Reworking, Recycling, Regeneration, and Salvaging\n\nWhen appropriate, reprocessing, reworking, recycling, regeneration, and salvaging operations should be described. For more detail, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nAppendix C Control of Materials\n\nA list of materials used in the manufacture of fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and drug products should be provided (i.e., the microorganism, cell bank system, media components, solvents, reagents, auxiliary materials). Information pertaining to the quality and control of these materials should also be provided.\n\n1. _Microorganism_Information about the microorganism used for production (i.e., genus, species, and type strain) and known genotypic and phenotypic characteristics should be provided. Additionally, the origin of the source material (or isolate) should be identified or described.\n\n2. Cell Bank System a. Master Cell Bank\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to generate the master cell bank (MCB) and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. The information should include:\n\nMethod, reagents, and media used in preparation\n\nDate of preparation\n\nProcess controls\n\nStorage conditions\n\nProcedures used in testing for relevant phenotypic and genotypic markers and determining culture purity\n\nProcedures used to ensure the absence of contamination from adventitious agents (e.g., microbial contamination and cross-contamination by other cell types) with tests and acceptance criteria specified\n\nb. Working Cell Bank\n\nPreservation of the microbial purity of the MCB is an important factor in maintaining the production strain. Often a working cell bank (WCB) is created so that the MCB will be less likely to be compromised. Creation of a WCB occurs via the propagation of the MCB through defined culture conditions, and then aliquots of the resultant homogenous culture suspension are partitioned into individual storage containers of appropriate size for routine production purposes.\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to derive a WCB from the MCB and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. Information similar to that submitted for the MCB should also be submitted for the WCB.\n\n3. Media Components\n\nA list of the media components used at each stage of the fermentation process should be included in the submission. Specifications should be provided for each component for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose.\n\nIf ruminant-based media components are used in the fermentation process, they should comply with the proposed BSE Medical Products Rule, issued on January 12, 2007 (72 FR 1582).\n\nAll animal-derived components should be identified and appropriate mitigation steps taken to prevent the transmission of adventitious agents.\n\n4. Solvents, Reagents, Auxiliary Materials\n\nA list of solvents, reagents, and other auxiliary materials used in the fermentation process should be provided. Specifications for each material should be included for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose. When water is used in the process, it should be of an appropriate quality for its intended use.\n\nControl of Critical Steps and Intermediates\n\nAll critical process controls and their associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria should be identified and justified and a brief description of the test provided. Furthermore, any experimental data to support the justification should be included.\n\nGood controls are essential during fermentation to ensure product consistency.\n\nEnd product testing alone is not adequate for demonstrating a fermentation process is under control.\n\nManufacturing processes, including fermentation, should be controlled to ensure that the product meets previously identified quality attributes.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #216 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Information - Fermentation-Derived Intermediates, Drug Substances, and Related Drug Products for Veterinary Medicinal Use \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.203909397125244", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: iii. Writing the protocol:\n\nAll regulatory SRs should be conducted in accordance with a protocol.\n\nProtocol review by CVM is not required, but it is strongly recommended for any study intended to support an application. Protocol concurrence helps to prevent expenditure of resources on a study that CVM is less likely to accept. Sponsors are encouraged to discuss specific questions about protocol design in early communications with CVM's Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (ONADE).\n\nAt a minimum, the protocol should include the following components:\n\nStudy objective:\n\nThe protocol should include a clear statement of the study objectives (e.g., the objective of the study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific formulation of drug, given at a defined dosage, for specific indications (and conditions of use) in specific species/classes). The objectives of the study are generally synonymous with the review question.\n\nStandard of conduct for SRs:\n\nThe SR should be conducted in accordance with an appropriate standard of conduct. Systematic reviews are, by nature, retrospective, and do not meet the definition of either a clinical study or nonclinical laboratory study. Elements of standards of conduct that apply to systematic reviews include: protocol development; organizational structure to ensure appropriate control of the study (e.g., investigator responsibilities, oversight (monitoring), quality assurance, quality control, and qualifications of personnel); procedures to ensure appropriate study documentation and archiving; and the documentation of the study conduct and results in a final study report. Standard expectations for data quality 9attributable, legible, contemporaneously recorded, original or a true copy, and accurate (ALCOA)) and integrity (credible, consistent, corroborative (CCC)) apply.\n\nControl type:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe systematic review protocol should include a design which permits a valid comparison to an appropriate control group and should evaluate the drug in the appropriate study population (species/class(es)). It should use methods to minimize bias on the part of observers and analysts of the data that are adequate to prevent undue influences on the results and interpretation of the study data. The systematic review should include procedures to identify, evaluate, and minimize bias both within an individual study and across the studies included in the systematic review.\n\nThe type of control chosen should appropriately reflect the review question and endpoints of interest and should adequately characterize the effect and variability in outcome in the population of interest in the absence of the new animal drug. Generally speaking, there are four types of control groups: untreated concurrent control, placebo control, active controls, or historical controls (21 CFR 514.117(b)(4) and the 2015 Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual).\n\nIn general, the most suitable control group data source is one that can be generated from the eligible studies included in the SR that also had treatment groups included in the meta-analysis (concurrent control). However, even if the studies selected for the SR are randomized/controlled studies, there may not be a sufficient number of included studies with the selected control group (negative control vs. active, etc.). In many cases, a mixture of study designs may be available for potential inclusion in the SR, including, in some cases, studies which do not have a concurrent control group. Studies that do not have the control group of interest should not be automatically excluded from the SR. In situations where not all eligible studies include the control group of interest, mathematical procedures may be employed to adjust the estimated control group effect size to account for unknown extraneous influences (Hunter, Jensen, and Rodgers 2014).20\n\nFootnote 20: Hunter, J.E., J.L. Jensen, and R. Rodgers. 2014. \u201cThe control group and meta-analysis.\u201d Journal of Methods and Measurements in the Social Sciences no. 5 (1):3-21.\n\nIf a control group cannot be compiled from the studies that also had treatment groups included in the meta-analysis, use of a historical control group may be appropriate for the regulatory decision in certain situations (e.g., studies in which the effect of the new animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity) (see 21 CFR 514.117(b)(4)(iv)).\n\n4.2.3 Literature search strategy:\n\nA literature search strategy should be described which has a high likelihood that articles relevant to the review question will be retrieved.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe protocol should include a description of the databases, search terms (keywords and Boolean operators), date and language restrictions, plans for hand-searching of certain publications (e.g., review articles) or personal contact of scientists, and a search of other sources of information such as conference proceedings, unpublished studies, theses, or dissertations.\n\nSponsors should include relevant pilot work or otherwise non-publicly available, proprietary studies in the regulatory SR. By not restricting the studies to those that are published, publication bias may be reduced.\n\nThe methodology of indexing within a database (e.g., the use of controlled vocabulary) should be considered in the design of the search strategy. As with scoping reviews, the inclusion of an information specialist in the design and implementation of the literature search is recommended. Overall, the description should be sufficient to allow the search to be repeated with the same results.\n\n4.2.3 Study selection (screening and eligibility assessment):\n\nA highly sensitive literature search may retrieve many studies which are not relevant to the SR. Therefore, the protocol should describe methods for choosing the studies including first screening the full list of literature (based on title, abstract, and keywords) and then reviewing full reports to determine the eligibility for inclusion in the SR. Appropriately designed screening inclusion and exclusion criteria are important for identifying literature that will contribute to a comprehensive database in an efficient manner without excluding relevant literature. The criteria should ensure the selection of studies which are designed to answer the review question for the particular drug formulation for the indication and conditions of use. The protocol should describe the use of more than one reviewer for conducting the screening and eligibility assessments to minimize the risk of error and/or bias. In addition, the protocol should describe the process for resolving disagreements between reviewers, if they occur (e.g., use of a third independent reviewer). The final study report should describe the numbers of reports that were screened, as well as the number that passed screening and eligibility phases and were ultimately included in the qualitative or quantitative (meta-analysis) assessment.\n\nExamples of screening criteria:\n\nType of study: The types of studies utilized for the review will depend on the objectives of the study. Examples include prospective randomized studies, cluster randomized control trials (RCTs), some types of non-randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and case control studies. Review articles are generally excluded but are used for hand-searching of additional references.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStudy animals: The studies are usually limited to the species (and class if necessary) for which the new animal drug is intended.\n\nTreatment: In the screening phase, criteria are usually specific only to the active ingredient because the title, abstract, and/or key words do not always provide enough information to identify specific drug products. At this phase, citations that are specific to alternate dosage forms or formulations which would not be used in the SR are excluded.\n\nOutcome measure: Whether or not a study includes a particular outcome measure is not always evident from the title, abstract, or keywords. Broad criteria are necessary to avoid excluding relevant studies. For example, if the outcome of interest is specific to a disease, it would be appropriate to include citations for studies in which a drug is used for the treatment of that disease. The evaluation of the full text of the study report may be necessary to determine if the outcomes of interest were used in the study.\n\nFor those citations with insufficient information to enable a screening evaluation using the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the protocol should allow for an evaluation of the full report in the eligibility phase of the study. For example, some citations (particularly those in foreign languages and/or without abstracts) do not have a sufficiently detailed title to allow for an appropriate screening assessment. If, after reviewing the full text, the reviewer determines that the report does not meet the screening criteria, it should be included in the counts of reports that did not pass the screening phase of the SR.\n\nGenerally, the eligibility criteria build upon screening criteria and require more specific information that is found in the full text of the study report.\n\nExamples of eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria:\n\nTreatment: For many SRs, eligible studies include a specific drug product (including the intended formulation). Criteria should be established to allow for confirmation of formulation and other information as needed and consistent with the purpose of the SR.\n\nAnimal information: If certain animal characteristics (e.g., disease state) are critical to the objectives of the study, these should be defined in the eligibility criteria.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.042957305908203", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: The goal of the adequate and well-controlled animal studies is to demonstrate that the investigational drug is statistically significantly superior to placebo and confers a treatment or prevention effect considered likely to be clinically meaningful. Sponsors should discuss power considerations and a proposed statistical analysis plan with the FDA before initiating planned studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nii.1.3 Selection of an Effective Dosing Regimen in Humans\n\nTo support human dose selection for an investigational drug, sponsors should characterize the PK profile of the drug in healthy humans and both the PK profile and the PD profile of the drug in the surrogate orthopoxvirus animal models that are used to demonstrate efficacy. In addition, the PK profile of the drug in infected animals should be compared with the PK profile of the drug in healthy animals to determine whether the specific orthopoxvirus infection affects the drug's PK profile. It is critical that the PK data in humans and the PK and PD data in animals are obtained in well-controlled studies using fully validated bioanalytical assays for determining drug concentrations. For each of the surrogate orthopoxvirus animal models used to establish efficacy, the exposure-response relationship of the drug should be established and the fully effective dose and the drug exposure associated with the fully effective dose should be determined. Furthermore, sponsors should consider interspecies differences in absorption, distribution (including plasma protein binding), metabolism, and excretion when determining the human dose.\n\nThe determination of treatment duration will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug, the proposed indication (i.e., treatment or prophylaxis), and the pathophysiology and disease course in animal models of orthopoxvirus infection versus humans with smallpox.\n\nAs described in the guidance for industry Product Development Under the Animal Rule, sponsors should select human doses that provide exposures that exceed the exposures in animals associated with the fully effective dose (ideally by severalfold if the drug's safety profile supports such dosing). This selection serves to accommodate any uncertainties relating to the similarity of the exposure-response relationship between humans and animals.\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology Considerations\n\nPharmacology/toxicology considerations for safety evaluation should follow the standard drug development paradigms for small molecules as outlined in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010) or for biologics as outlined in the ICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (July 1997). Historical clinical data suggest that some patients (e.g., immunocompromised) with variola virus infection may have had clinical disease lasting longer than 2 weeks; therefore, we recommend that initial toxicology and safety studies take this possibility into account. Duration of studies to support investigational new drug application (IND) and new drug application (NDA)/biologics license application (BLA) filings are outlined in the respective ICH guidances.\n\nWe do not anticipate that carcinogenicity studies will be needed for drugs that might be used only to treat established smallpox because the administration of such drugs will not, in most cases, exceed 6 months. However, if there is a cause for concern (e.g., positive genotoxicity or other risks for carcinogenicity), then follow-up discussions with DAVP may be warranted. Lastly, see the guidances for industry Product Development Under the Animal Rule and Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format -- Standardized Study Data (December 2014) regarding requirements for electronic submission of nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology as well as nonclinical efficacy datasets.\n\nAppendix C Nonclinical Virology Considerations\n\nStudy reports for the investigational drug should provide results and analyses describing its mechanism of action, establish its specific antiviral activity in cell culture and animal models, provide data on the development and potential mechanisms of viral drug resistance (or reduced susceptibility of the virus to the drug) in cell culture and animal models, and assess its cytotoxicity and mitochondrial toxicity. Additional information on virology studies can be found in the guidance for industry Antiviral Product Development -- Conducting and Submitting Virology Studies to the Agency (June 2006).\n\nWe recommend that sponsors evaluate the investigational drug's antiviral activity against a broad panel of orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia virus and other orthopoxviruses expected to be used in animal models (e.g., monkeypox virus, rabbitpox virus, ectromelia virus). Such assessments constitute a broad-based orthopoxvirus testing strategy to screen for potential relevance to variola virus and assess the potential of the investigational drug to treat vaccine complications or human monkeypox. Ultimately, sponsors should explore the potential appropriateness of testing the antiviral activity of the investigational drug against variola virus isolates if other data are sufficiently promising to proceed to this stage.\n\nOrthopoxvirus DNA polymerases replicate their viral genomes with high fidelity, complicating the genotypic analysis of resistance in animal studies. To aid in the interpretation of drug resistance results from animal studies, sponsors should include plans to evaluate the performance of their nucleotide sequencing assay(s) to help distinguish between nucleotide sequence changes caused by their resistance assay versus those occurring in vivo and possibly contributing to drug resistance.\n\nSponsors should submit information on sample collection, assays performed, and validation approaches for these assays. Using a specific procedure, method, or test system in an investigational protocol for a nonclinical laboratory study, or as a laboratory procedure supporting a clinical trial, does not constitute FDA endorsement of that procedure, method, or test system, or FDA approval for clinical laboratory use.12\n\nFootnote 12: Submission of an investigational device exemption to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health may be warranted if an investigational assay is used in a clinical trial.\n\nThe FDA performs independent assessments of virologic and resistance data. Sponsors should consult with DAVP before submitting virology datasets to obtain information on the most recent recommended formats. In the case of next-generation sequence analysis, sponsors should refer to the guidance for industry and technical specification document Submitting Next Generation Sequencing Data to the Division of Antiviral Products (July 2019), which describes the procedure for submission of files in the FASTQ format (containing sequence nucleotides and quality information).\n\nLaboratory work with certain orthopoxviruses must comply with applicable regulations (e.g., the select agent regulations found at 42 CFR part 73)13 and should incorporate relevant biosafety and biosecurity procedures as appropriate to the viruses studied. Sponsors should contact relevant government agencies, such as the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, for more information regarding biosafety procedures.14 Sponsors should also be aware that all studies of variola virus must be conducted in collaboration with CDC and will require approval from the World Health Organization.\n\nFootnote 13: Information on the Federal Select Agent Program can be found at https://www.selectagents.gov.\n\nFootnote 14: Information on biosafety can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm and https://www.nih.gov/research-training/safety-regulation-guidance.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nFor the FDA to approve a drug for treating or preventing smallpox under the Animal Rule, the safety of the drug must be established.15 However, the Animal Rule does not provide specific provisions for evaluating safety. Therefore, the FDA evaluates these drugs under preexisting NDA/BLA regulations for establishing the safety of new drugs or biological products. Under most conditions, the human safety data for smallpox drugs will come from healthy volunteer studies and/or relevant human safety data for the same drugs developed for other indications. Evaluating important drug-drug interactions also may involve healthy volunteer studies. In the event of a smallpox public health emergency, human safety and efficacy data also can be obtained by using investigational smallpox drugs in clinical field trials. For drugs approved under the Animal Rule, postmarketing clinical trials are required when feasible and ethical (21 CFR part 314, subpart I, for drugs and 21 CFR part 601, subpart H, for biologics).\n\n1.1 Healthy Volunteer Safety Trials\n\nOutside of a public health emergency, the safety evaluation of drugs developed solely for treating or preventing smallpox largely depends on safety trials in healthy volunteers. Nonclinical safety and activity data of the investigational drug should be available before the initiation of human trials to support safety and to guide clinical trial design (e.g., dose, duration), as outlined in the respective ICH guidances for small molecules (ICH M3(R2)) or biologics (ICH S6(R1)). Sponsors should discuss any concerns related to the safety or ethics of healthy volunteer trials with the FDA early in the drug development program.\n--------------------\nContext title: Smallpox (Variola Virus) Infection- Developing Drugs for Treatment or Prevention Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.8010945320129395", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix E Target Animal Safety\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nSection 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval, including target animal safety. See FD&C Act section 512(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D)).\n\nLiterature, including narrative reviews, SR, and meta-analysis, may be acceptable to fulfill all or part of the requirements for target animal safety for a new animal drug application or an application for conditional approval (see FD&C Act section 571(a)(2)(B)). Literature is most commonly used to evaluate the extent and quality of information available on the safety of a new animal drug for the proposed indication or proposed conditions of use, support the design of the target animal safety evaluation, and/or provide information to predict potential adverse effects in the target species. In some cases, literature may provide all or a portion of the information required to demonstrate whether a new animal drug is safe for the intended use and conditions of use.\n\nCVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the development plan to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of using literature to fulfill some or all of the target animal safety requirements.\n\nAppendix B Preliminary Information\n\nGFI #185 (VICH GL43), \"Target Animal Safety for Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products\" (April 2009), describes the use of knowledge about the pharmacology and toxicology of an investigational veterinary pharmaceutical product (IVPP) to assist in the determination of the types of studies necessary in the evaluation of the safety of an IVPP in the intended species under the proposed conditions of use; in the design (dose, frequency of dosing, overdose levels, durations of treatment, and endpoints) of such studies; and in the prediction of potential adverse effects. GFI #185 recommends the use of published literature, in addition to preliminary studies from target and non-target laboratory animal studies, as potential sources of the pharmacology and toxicology data.\n\n3.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA review of the published literature may provide information about the known pharmacologic and toxicological properties in target or non-target species of the drug, to include carriers, excipients, inactive ingredients, APIs, or about closely related compounds that may be useful in planning the target animal safety evaluation.\n\nInformation that may be useful includes the following:\n\nMechanism of action\n\nMechanism of toxicity\n\nToxicological syndrome/target organs or tissues\n\nClinical signs of toxicity/biomarkers of toxicity\n\nTime of onset and duration of clinical signs of toxicity\n\nVariability/tolerance among animals (species, breed, class, age, or other differences)\n\nSeverity, chronicity, and likelihood of toxic effects\n\nDifferences by animal age/life stage/production class/breed\n\nPharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics\n\nPotential for drug-drug interactions\n\nEffects of other diseases/conditions on toxicity\n\nEndpoints that can be collected from other required studies\n\nEffects on reproduction\n\nEffects at the site of administration (injection, topical, etc.)\n\nGenerally, a narrative literature review or a scoping review, rather than an SR, is appropriate for presenting the pharmacologic and toxicologic information to CVM for the purposes of supporting the target animal safety development plan and the design of safety studies.\n\n4 Literature to Satisfy Target Animal Safety Requirements\n\nThe safety of a new animal drug in the target animal is typically based on one or more non-clinical laboratory studies (margin of safety studies) and observations from field studies. As described in GFI #185, other specific studies, such as reproductive safety, injection site, or other specifically designed studies, may be needed to address the animal safety requirements. The need for these specific studies depends on the drug and the intended conditions of use.\n\nThe literature may provide information from target and non-target species, including laboratory animals, which may be used in lieu of the margin of safety study or other studies (injection site, reproductive safety, etc.) typically needed to satisfy the target animal safety requirements, a justification that typical studies (or certain endpoints within these studies) are not needed, an identification of information \"gaps,\" or theidentification of safety observations that could be obtained during the effectiveness study(ies).\n\nMargin of safety study.\n\nTypically, the margin of safety study includes multiples of the highest intended drug dosage (daily dose, frequency, and duration) where the study results demonstrate the margin of safety above the maximum dosage. The study must adequately demonstrate that the new animal drug is safe for the intended target animal/class under the proposed conditions of use, that the chosen endpoints are the most appropriate outcomes for the evaluation of safety, and that valid inferences can be drawn to the target population. The number of studies needed to assess overall safety, or a particular endpoint will depend on the size and number of studies, intended use/conditions of use, breadth of the indication, consistency of results, the quality of the studies, and/or the quality of the reporting of the studies.\n\nIn some cases, a sufficient amount of information exists in the published literature and/or in preliminary studies to either: (1) justify that a margin of safety study is not needed (negligible systemic exposure to the API and based on pre-existing knowledge in pharmacology and toxicology there is no safety concern30); or (2) perform an SR (+/- meta-analysis) which provides adequate information to determine the safety of the new animal drug in the target animal. The literature may provide a volume and variety of evidence that far exceeds the data traditionally available from a margin of safety study.\n\nFootnote 30: Per GFI #185, even if a margin of safety study is not needed, a safety study at the site of administration is recommended.\n\nb. Performing an SR to satisfy target animal safety requirements\n\nWhen considering literature to satisfy any or all animal safety requirements, and before developing the protocol, the sponsor should perform a high-level initial screen of available literature with considerations such as dose, formulation, endpoints appropriate for an animal safety evaluation, conditions of use, and inferential value for the target population. This screen should be performed in a way that minimizes bias in case a future SR and/or meta-analysis will be performed; the person or persons performing the high-level screening should not be involved in the design of the protocol for the conduct of the regulatory SR.\n\nAn SR of the literature may provide a broader overview of the safety of the drug in the target animal population when compared to a more comprehensive evaluation in a small number of individual animals (e.g., a laboratory margin of safety study). For some drugs and indications, an assessment under more variable conditions of use may be preferable for the evaluation of animal safety. Typical assessment of animal safety relies substantially on clinical outcomes, assessments of those outcomes, and impacts on the animal with regard to determining the margin of safety. Statistical analyses may be of more importance in identifying dose response trends or observations of most interest.\n\nFor an SR and/or meta-analysis to evaluate safety, the review question may be broad, to capture any abnormal observations related to administration of the new animal drug, or specific, to address a certain safety-related endpoint. An adequate target animal safety assessment will include the identification of target organs, where possible, and confirmation of the margin of safety for the labeled dosage regimen (dose, route, frequency, duration) in the intended species/class(es).\n\nThe SR should evaluate a specific formulation of drug produced in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices. Formulation should be taken into consideration when selecting the studies that are appropriate for inclusion.\n\nA meta-analysis may not be appropriate for all submissions that include a literature or systematic review. Other types of analyses (i.e., a multicriteria decision analysis or a weight-of-evidence analysis) or a qualitative assessment may be more appropriate. The available information should be used to determine what conclusions can be drawn, such as an evaluation of the risk of adverse events or safety concerns for the animal associated with the use of the drug at the proposed dose under the intended conditions of use, and identify any gaps remaining in the target animal safety evaluation. Using the literature to develop a hazard characterization may be adequate to frame the further studies and study designs needed to meet the target animal safety requirements. The strength of support provided by the body of available literature is useful in determining the number and type of necessary studies and the potential adverse reactions or safety impacts that may be observed. If gaps are identified, the available information can be used to inform methods used to address the gaps and the design of one or more studies to address the gaps, which include alternative or non-traditional studies. Information from the literature may be used to inform the design of the margin of safety study in an evaluation and the prediction of potential adverse effects that may occur in the target species.\n\n4 Other Laboratory Safety Studies\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.602142810821533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Concluding equivalence or non-inferiority based on observing a non-significant test result of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the investigational product and the active comparator is inappropriate.\n\nThere are also special issues in the choice of analysis sets. Subjects who withdraw or dropout of the treatment group or the comparator group will tend to have a lack of response, and hence the results of using the full analysis set (see Glossary) may be biased toward demonstrating equivalence (see Section 5.2.3).\n\n3.3.3 Trials to Show Dose-response Relationship\n\nHow response is related to the dose of a new investigational product is a question to which answers may be obtained in all phases of development, and by a variety of approaches (see ICH E4). Dose-response trials may serve a number of objectives, amongst which the following are of particular importance: the confirmation of efficacy; the investigation of the shape and location of the dose-response curve; the estimation of an appropriate starting dose; the identification of optimal strategies for individual dose adjustments; the determination of a maximal dose beyond which additional benefit would be unlikely to occur. These objectives should be addressed using the data collected at a number of doses under investigation, including a placebo (zero dose) wherever appropriate. For this purpose the application of procedures to estimate the relationship between dose and response, including the construction of confidence intervals and the use of graphical methods, is as important as the use of statistical tests. The hypothesis tests that are used may need to be tailored to the natural ordering of doses or to particular questions regarding the shape of the dose-response curve (e.g. monotonicity). The details of the planned statistical procedures should be given in the protocol.\n\nGroup Sequential Designs\n--------------------\nContext title: E9_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.623801231384277"], "Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on: February 3, 2016\n\nAs of April 3, 2016, this document supersedes \"Medical Device Use-Safety: Incorporating Human Factors Engineering into Risk Management\" issued July 18, 2000.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on June 21, 2011.\n\nFor questions regarding this document, contact the Human Factors Premarket Evaluation Team at (301) 796-5580.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nOffice of Device Evaluation\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nYou may submit electronic comments and suggestions at any time for Agency consideration to http://www.regulations.gov.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nFDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in following appropriate human factors and usability engineering processes to maximize the likelihood that new medical devices will be safe and effective for the intended users, uses and use environments.\n\nThe recommendations in this guidance document are intended to support manufacturers in improving the design of devices to minimize potential use errors and resulting harm. The FDA believes that these recommendations will enable manufacturers to assess and reduce risks associated with medical device use.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance recommends that manufacturers follow human factors or usability engineering processes during the development of new medical devices, focusing specifically on the user interface, where the user interface includes all points of interaction between the product and the user(s) including elements such as displays, controls, packaging, product labels, instructions for use, etc. While following these processes can be beneficial for optimizing user interfaces in other respects (e.g., maximizing ease of use, efficiency, and user satisfaction), FDA is primarily concernedthat devices are safe and effective for the intended users, uses, and use environments. The goal is to ensure that the device user interface has been designed such that use errors that occur during use of the device that could cause harm or degrade medical treatment are either eliminated or reduced to the extent possible.\n\nAs part of their design controls1, manufacturers conduct a risk analysis that includes the risks associated with device use and the measures implemented to reduce those risks. ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971, Medical Devices - Application of risk management to medical devices, defines risk as the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of the potential harm2. However, because probability is very difficult to determine for use errors, and in fact many use errors cannot be anticipated until device use is simulated and observed, the severity of the potential harm is more meaningful for determining the need to eliminate (design out) or reduce resulting harm. If the results of risk analysis indicate that use errors could cause serious harm to the patient or the device user, then the manufacturer should apply appropriate human factors or usability engineering processes according to this guidance document. This is also the case if a manufacturer is modifying a marketed device to correct design deficiencies associated with use, particularly as a corrective and preventive action (CAPA).\n\nFootnote 1: 21 CFR 820.30\n\nFootnote 2: ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007, definition 2.16\n\nCDRH considers human factors testing a valuable component of product development for medical devices. CDRH recommends that manufacturers consider human factors testing for medical devices as a part of a robust design control subsystem. CDRH believes that for those devices where an analysis of risk indicates that users performing tasks incorrectly or failing to perform tasks could result in serious harm, manufacturers should submit human factors data in premarket submissions (i.e., PMA, 510(k)). In an effort to make CDRH's premarket submission expectations clear regarding which device types should include human factors data in premarket submissions, CDRH is issuing a draft guidance document List of Highest Priority Devices for Human Factors Review, Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidanc\n\neDocuments/UCM484097.pdf) When final, this document will represent the Agency's current thinking on this issue.\n\n3 Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance, the following terms are defined.\n\nAbnormal use\n\nAn intentional act or intentional omission of an act that reflects violative or reckless use or sabotage beyond reasonable means of risk mitigation or control through design of the user interface.\n\nCritical task\n\nA user task which, if performed incorrectly or not performed at all, would or could cause serious harm to the patient or user, where harm is defined to include compromised medical care.\n\nFormative evaluation\n\nProcess of assessing, at one or more stages during the device development process, a user interface or user interactions with the user interface to identify the interface's strengths and weaknesses and to identify potential use errors that would or could result in harm to the patient or user.\n\nHazard\n\nPotential source of harm.\n\nHazardous situation\n\nCircumstance in which people are exposed to one or more hazard(s).\n\nHuman factors engineering\n\nThe application of knowledge about human behavior, abilities, limitations, and other characteristics of medical device users to the design of medical devices including mechanical and software driven user interfaces, systems, tasks, user documentation, and user training to enhance and demonstrate safe and effective use.\n\nHuman factors engineering and usability engineering can be considered to be synonymous.\n\nHuman factors validation testing\n\nTesting conducted at the end of the device development process to assess user interactions with a device user interface to identify use errors that would or could result in serious harm to the patient or user. Human factors validation testing is also used to assess the effectiveness of risk management measures. Human factors validation testing represents one portion of design validation.\n\nTask\n\nAction or set of actions performed by a user to achieve a specific goal.\n\nUse error\n--------------------\nContext title: Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5287011861801147", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Class III devices generally are those for which insufficient information exists to determine that general or special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Examples of Class III devices include replacement heart valves, silicone gel-filled breast implants, and implanted cerebellar stimulators.\n\n3 What are examples of medical devices?\n\nExamples of medical devices include surgical lasers, wheelchairs, sutures, pacemakers, vascular grafts, intraocular lenses, and orthopedic pins. A longer list of examples of medical devices is in the FDA Information Sheet Guidance, \"Significant Risk vs. Non-Significant Risk Devices.\"\n\nMedical devices also include diagnostic products. Examples of diagnostics include in vitro diagnostic reagents and test kits such as pregnancy test kits, and imaging systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n4 What is a premarket notification (510(k)) submission?\n\nA premarket notification, or 510(k), is submitted to FDA before a manufacturer proposes to market a medical device. If FDA agrees the new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device for which premarket approval is not required, the manufacturer may market it immediately. FDA does not require clinical data in most 510(k)s. However, if clinical data are necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence, the clinical study must comply with the IDE, IRB, and human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) regulations. See section 520(g) of the act and 21 CFR Parts 812, 56 and 50.\n\n5 What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n\nA premarket approval (PMA) application is the most stringent type of device marketing application for medical devices. FDA approves a PMA if it determines that the application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).\n\n6 Where can I find more information about 510(k)s and PMAs?\n\nAdditional information is available about these programs on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's website at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/.\n\n7 What is a humanitarian use device (HUD)?\n\nAn HUD is a device that is intended to benefit patients in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases or conditions that affect or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States per year. The Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) determines if a device meets specific requirements, including scientific rationale and population prevalence, for designation as a HUD.\n\n8 What is a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application?\n\nA Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application is similar to a PMA, but because a HUD is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA, an HDE application is not required to contain the results of scientifically valid clinical investigations demonstrating that the device is effective for its intended purpose. However, the HDE must contain sufficient information for FDA to determine that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment. Section 520(m)(2)(C). An approved HDE authorizes marketing of an HUD.\n\nUnder the statute, once the HDE is approved, the HDE holder is responsible for ensuring that the approved HUD is only administered at institutions that have an IRB constituted and acting pursuant to 21 CFR 56, including conducting continuing review of the use of the HUD. In addition, an HUD should be administered only if such use has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) located at the facility, or by a similarly constituted IRB that has agreed to oversee such use and to which the local IRB has deferred in a letter to the HDE holder. An HDE holder may wish to ensure that this happens by not shipping the HUD to the facility until it has received confirmation of IRB approval.\n\nNOTE: HUDs should not be used until AFTER the HDE applicant obtains approval of the HDE from FDA and the IRB approves its use. IRBs should ensure that HDE approval has been granted before approving the device for use at their institution.\n\n9 What are the responsibilities of the IRBs regarding HDEs?\n\nInitial review:\n\nInitial IRB approval should be performed at a convened IRB meeting. The IRB does not need to review and approve individual uses of an HUD, but rather the IRB may approve use of the device as it sees fit. That is, the IRB may approve use of the HUD without any further restrictions, under a protocol, or on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContinuing review:\n\nIRBs may approve the use of the device for a period of time, not to exceed one year. 21 CFR 56.109(f). In some higher risk cases, IRBs have approved HUDs for a specific number of patients and have required a summary report before approving the use in additional patients. Continuing review should follow the requirements found at 21 CFR 56, and may be conducted using the expedited review procedures (see 21 CFR 56.110) unless the IRB determines that full board review should be performed. The agency believes that the expedited review procedures are appropriate for continuing review since the initial review would have been performed by the full board and use of the HUD within its approved labeling does not constitute research.\n\n10 Is informed consent required when treating/diagnosing a patient with an HUD?\n\nThe act and the HDE regulations do not require informed consent. Because an HDE provides for marketing approval, use of the HUD does not constitute research or an investigation which would normally require consent from the study subjects. However, there is nothing in the law or regulations that prohibits a state or institution from requiring prospective informed consent, when feasible. In fact, most HDE holders have developed patient labeling that incorporates information that may be used to assist a patient in making an informed decision about the use of the device. For example, the patient labeling may contain a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of the HUD, as well as any procedures associated with the use of the device. The HUD labeling also states that the device is a humanitarian use device for which effectiveness for the labeled indication has not been demonstrated. See 21 CFR 814.104(b)(4)(ii).\n\nUnless it is an emergency, before an HUD is used off-label, the agency recommends that the HDE holder obtain FDA approval of the use following the compassionate use policy for unapproved devices. (See Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the \"IDE Policies and Procedures Guidance.\"2) If FDA approves the compassionate use request, the physician should ensure that the patient protection measures are addressed before the device is used and should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient. If the situation is life-threatening and there is not time to get FDA approval for the off-label use, FDA recommends that the emergency use procedures outlined in the above referenced guidance be followed.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance may be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\nSometimes a physician or HDE holder may develop a research protocol designed to collect safety and effectiveness data to support a PMA for the device. In that case, an IDE is not needed if the research is within the approved labeling; however, IRB approval for the investigational study must be obtained before the research may begin. Informed consent must also be obtained from the subjects participating in the study. If the research is for a new use, the IDE regulation must be followed. 21 CFR Parts 812, 50, and 56.\n\n11 What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n\nIn accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA's human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.3482751846313477", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.4.2 Factors relevant to application of the algorithm.\n\nThe factors listed below are intended to further illustrate the kinds of issues that may be relevant when determining whether a new combination product presents safety and effectiveness issues similar to those presented by a previous combination product, or which are the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by a combination product. We note that the list of factors below is not all-inclusive. Also, FDA may consider individual characteristics of the specific product. Such case-by-case analysis allows the Agency to take into account, for example, technological developments, evolving scientific understanding, and specific factual information concerning the particular product, such as its composition, or mechanism of action for achieving an intended use.\n\nThe following questions are not listed in order of importance; indeed some factors may be weighted more than others depending on various issues presented by each individual combination product. If you believe FDA may need to consider the algorithm in the assignment of your product (i.e., if your product's most important therapeutic action cannot be determined with reasonable certainty), then we recommend you consider and address these and/or other safety and effectiveness issues, as applicable, for your product:\n\nWhat is the intended use(s)/indication(s) for use of the product?\n\nWhat is the overall therapeutic effect(s) of the product as a whole?\n\nDoes a device constituent part incorporate a novel or complex design or have the potential for clinically significant failure modes?\n\nIs a drug constituent part a new molecular entity or new formulation?\n\nHas a generic version of the drug been approved under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act?\n\nDoes the drug have a narrow therapeutic index?\n\nIs the biological product constituent part a particularly fragile molecule?\n\nHow well understood are the product's constituent parts? Is one constituent part relatively common, while another presents more significant safety and effectiveness issues relating to the risks it poses, its effectiveness, or its novelty?\n\nWhich constituent part raises greater risks?\n\nHave any of the constituent parts been previously approved or cleared for the same or a similar use?\n\nIs there a new indication, route of administration or a significant change in dose or use of one of the constituent parts?\n\nAddressing the assignment algorithm in your RFDIf you cannot determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of your combination product, you must recommend an assignment for your product based on the assignment algorithm at 21 CFR 3.4(b). See 21 CFR 3.7(c)(3). Under the first step, you should consider whether FDA regulates other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole. In other words, you should consider whether an FDA Center has direct experience with a combination product similar to yours. You should identify any such other combination products that you are aware of that you believe FDA should consider in determining the assignment of your product, and explain how your product is similar. For example, if you have developed a new drug for treating glaucoma that will be combined with a contact lens, and you are aware of other products reviewed by FDA that consist of a contact lens and another drug for this intended use, you should identify those products.\n\nIf you do not believe that your product as a whole is similar to other combination products that a Center has already reviewed or that you are aware a Center is currently reviewing, you should address the second step of the algorithm. Even if you believe your product is similar to another, we recommend that you explain how you think we should assign your product should we find it necessary to move to this second step in the algorithm. For this part of the algorithm, you should identify the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by your combination product, and explain, in your opinion, which Center has the most expertise related to those questions. For example, if this is the first time the Agency is presented with a vision-correcting contact lens containing a glaucoma drug, then, using the factors described above, you should explain, in your opinion, which Center has more expertise to answer these questions. In this case, you might explain that the most significant safety and effectiveness questions are related to the characterization, manufacturing, and clinical performance of the drug component, while the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the vision-correcting contact lens are considered more routine. Based on these criteria, you might recommend that CDER has the most expertise related to these issues.\n\n10 Schedule and Duration of Use.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(x)\n\nYou must briefly explain how often and for how long your product is intended to be used. For example, if your product is a non-combination device that would be implanted in the body during one surgical procedure, you should state the duration for which it is implanted or if it will be implanted with the expectation that, as long as the device functions, it will remain in the body indefinitely. In other cases, such as with a wound dressing, for instance, an RFD might explain that the dressing should be used over a four-hour period, after which a change of dressing would occur if needed, with a maximum of six dressings to be used over a 24-hour time period.\n\nAnother example would be that your product is a drug to be delivered by a device every twelve hours over a period of time not to exceed 10 days.\n\n11 Dose and Route of Administration.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xi)\n\nAs applicable, you should briefly explain the dose (amount) of the drug or biological product (or constituent part) to be used, and how it will be used in or on the body. For example, for a combination product wound dressing consisting of a drug and device delivery system, you would identify the specific amount of the drug contained in the device, and that it would be applied topically to the specific type of wound your product is intended to treat. If your product is an injectable drug, you would explain that the delivery device would be used to inject a specific dose of the drug intramuscularly, intravenously, etc.\n\nEven if you believe your product is a device (containing no drug or biological products), it may be helpful to provide information about the dose or route of administration for the product. For example, if your product is an injectable product, such as a wrinkle filler, you should describe the amount of product being injected and the site of the injection.\n\n12 Related Products.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xii)\n\nIf you think there are other products like yours, or other products with related components, you must briefly explain what they are, how they are regulated, and their regulatory status (e.g., approved, investigational, etc.) so that we can consider them when classifying and/or making the assignment for your product. Please include the product application numbers when available (e.g., 510(k) or NDA number). You should explain any similarities or differences between these products and your product and state how these are relevant to the classification and/or assignment of your product.\n\nIf you are not aware of other products like yours or other products with related components, please state this.\n\n13 Other Relevant Information.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xiii)\n\nIf you think there is anything else we should consider when determining the appropriate classification and/or assignment of your product, you should explain that in this portion of your RFD. For example, literature references describing the product, its components, and its modes of action are often helpful.\n\n14 Sponsor's Recommendation.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(3)\n\nThe final section of an RFD must include your recommendation for the classification (drug, device, biological product, or combination product) and assignment (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) of your product.\n\nIf you believe your product is a non-combination product, you should state whether you believe it meets the statutory definition of a drug, device, or biological product and your rationale for this recommendation. Your classification recommendation should be based on the composition, mode(s) of action, and intended use(s) of your product. Based on this recommended classification, you should then state your recommendation as to which Center (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) should regulate your product.\n\nIf you believe your product is a combination product, you should state what type of combination product it may be (e.g., drug/device) and your rationale for this recommendation. Next, you should explain which Center (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) should have primary jurisdiction (the \"lead\") for regulation of your product. This explanation should be based on the composition, intended use(s), modes of action, and PMOA of the product. If you cannot determine which single mode of action provides the most important therapeutic action of the product, you must use the algorithm set forth in 21 CFR 3.4(b) to make your recommendation of \"lead\" Center (see Section 9 above).\n\nIf you are unclear whether your product is a combination product or a non-combination product, we recommend you provide an analysis for the product being a combination product and for being a non-combination product.\n\nAppendix F How can I limit my submission to 15 pages including attachments as required by the regulation, and still provide all the information FDA needs to make its decision?\n--------------------\nContext title: How to Write a Request for Designation (RFD) Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.647442102432251", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: IX Additional Resources\n\nFDA guidance document entitled \"Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications.\" (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guide ncedocuments/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA guidance document entitled \"Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff.\" (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guide ncedocuments/ucm311176.pdf).\n\nFDA guidance document entitled \"Procedures for Class II Device Exemptions from Premarket Notification.\" (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm080199.pdf ).\n\nGargis A.S. et al, \"Assuring the Quality of Next-Generation Sequencing in Clinical Laboratory Practice,\" Nat Biotechnol. 2012 30(11):1033-6.\n\n\"Molecular Pathology Checklist,\" College of American Pathologists (April 21, 2014).\n\nRehm H.L. et al., \"ACMG Clinical Laboratory Standards for Next-Generation Sequencing,\" Genet Med. 2013 15(9):733-47.\n\nSchrijver I. et al., \"Methods-Based Proficiency Testing In Molecular Genetic Pathology,\" The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2014), 16(3):283-7.\n\nAnalytical Performance Specifications for Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (M00118, V1).

Based on the least burdensome principle, the term \"necessary\" means that FDA considers \"the minimum required information that would support\" (1) \"a determination by [FDA] that an application provides reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device\"14 or (2) \"a determination of substantial equivalence between a new device and a predicate device.\"15Footnote 15: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidan\n\nFootnote 16: See Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)) and 21 CFR 812.2.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdditional information related to how FDA intends to apply the least burdensome provisions is available in the following FDA guidances (\"Least Burdensome Guidances\") that discuss the principles with which the recommendations discussed in this guidance are consistent:\n\nThe Least Burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, dated February 5, 2019, available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidan\n\nDeveloping and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, dated September 29, 2017, available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidan\n\nce/GuidanceDocuments/ucm073680.pdf.\n\nAvailable Premarket Pathways\n\nThe appropriate premarket submission pathway for a given medical device is determined by the risks associated with the device type as well as the level of regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The available submission pathways (e.g., premarket notification (510(k)), De Novo classification (De Novo) request, Premarket Approval (PMA) Application, or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)) are briefly discussed in sections III.B.1-4 of this guidance.\n\nWhen clinical evidence is necessary to support marketing authorization of a medical device, an investigational device exemption (IDE) may be necessary.16 An IDE allows the investigational device to be used in a clinical study in the United States in order to collect safety and effectiveness data. An approved IDE permits a device to be shipped lawfully for the purpose of conducting investigations of the device. FDA has published numerous guidance documents related to IDEs, which can be found at: https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour\n\nFootnote 16: Valid scientific evidence is defined as \u201cevidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use.\u201d (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)).\n\nThe Device/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE/ucm162453.htm.\n\nAlthough a manufacturer or sponsor may submit any form of evidence to FDA in an attempt to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of a device, the Agency relies upon only valid scientific evidence17 to determine whether there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. After considering the nature of the device and the rules in 21 CFR 860.7, the Commissioner will determine whether the evidence submitted or otherwise available to the Commissioner is valid scientific evidence for the purpose of determining the safety or effectiveness of a particular device and whether the available evidence, when taken as a whole, is adequate to support a determination that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its conditions of use.18\n\nFootnote 18: 21 CFR 860.7(c)(1).\n\n1 Premarket Notification (510(k))\n\nIf FDA has previously cleared through a 510(k) or granted a De Novo request for another device of the same type (i.e., a legally-marketed predicate device),19 as a new device, a 510(k) is typically the appropriate pathway for the new device.20 Additional information on the 510(k) Program can be found in the guidance document entitled \"The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)]; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\" dated July 28, 2014, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm284443.pdf.\n\nFootnote 19: Under 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3), a legally marketed predicate is a device that: (1) was legally marketed in the United States prior to May 28, 1976 (preamendments device) and for which a PMA is not required; or (2) has been reclassified from Class III to II or I; or (iii) has been found substantially equivalent (SE) though the 510(k) process.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)), and 21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E.\n\nFootnote 21: Section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)).\n\nFootnote 22: FDA may decline to undertake a De Novo request if the conditions set forth in section 513(f)(2)(A)(iv) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(2)(A)(iv)) are met.\n\n2 De Novo Classification Request\n\nDevices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified based on the criteria at section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(1)) are 'automatically' or'statutorily' classified into Class III.21 However, if the device appears, based on what is known about the device, to meet the statutory standards for classification into Class I or II under section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, (i.e., general controls or general and special controls would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device), the device may be eligible for De Novo classification.22 If the requester demonstrates that the device meets the statutory standards for classification into Class I or II under section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, i.e., that general controls, or a combination of general controls and special controls, are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, FDA will grant the De Novo request and issue a written order classifying the specific device and device type in Class I or Class II.\n\nFootnote 21: Section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)).\n\nAdditional information on the De Novo Program can be found in the guidance document entitled \"De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation); Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\"\n\ndated October 30, 2017, available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Gui\n\ndanceDocuments/ucm080197.pdf.\n\n3 Premarket Approval Application\n\nPremarket approval (PMA) is required before most Class III devices can be marketed.23 A PMA application must demonstrate a \"reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness\" by \"weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use,\" among other relevant factors.24 To aid in this process, PMA applicants submit valid scientific evidence, including one or more clinical investigations where appropriate, which FDA reviews to determine whether \"the device will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device.\"25\n\nFootnote 23: See section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(1)(C)).\n\nFootnote 24: See sections 513(a)(2), 515(d)(1)(A), and 515(d)(2)(A)-(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(2), 360c(d)(1)(A) and (d)(2)(A)-(B)); see also 21 CFR 860.7(b), (d), and (e).\n\nFootnote 25: Section 513(a)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(3)(A)).\n\nFor information regarding PMAs, see FDA's guidance entitled \"Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,\" dated August 24, 2016.

To be eligible for an HDE, a device must first be designated as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD).26 Additional information about the HUD designation process can be found in the draft guidance document entitled \"Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program; Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\" dated June 13, 2018,\"27 available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm389275.pdf.\n--------------------\nContext title: Evaluation of Devices Used with Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.455996513366699", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: On June 14, 2023, FDA issued a guidance titled \"Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions.\"1 This final guidance supersedes the Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices, issued on May 11, 2005. The final guidance issued on June 14, 2023, provides information regarding the recommended documentation sponsors should include in premarket submissions for FDA's evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of device software functions. In particular, the final guidance includes information to help determine a device's Documentation Level (formerly known as Level of Concern). The purpose of the Documentation Level is to help identify the minimum amount of information that would support a premarket submission that includes device software functions.\n\nFootnote 1: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions-device-software-functions.\n\nWithin the framework of the superseded guidance, electrosurgical devices intended for use in general surgery were considered a device with a Major Level of Concern. Based on the device's risk in the context of the device's intended use, as discussed in the final guidance \"Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions,\" electrosurgical devices intended for use in general surgery should generally address the recommendations for an Enhanced Documentation Level. The actual Documentation Level for your device may vary based on the specifics of your device.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket notification (510(k)) submissions for electrosurgical devices intended for use in general surgery. These devices are designed to cut and/or remove tissue and control bleeding through the use of high-frequency electrical current. For the purpose of this guidance, electrosurgical devices may also be called radiofrequency (RF) devices or high-frequency (HF) devices.\n\nFor the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.1 For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, refer to the FDA guidance titled \"Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.\"2\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThe scope of this document is limited to the Class II electrosurgical devices and accessories classified under the following regulation number:\n\nSection 878.4400 Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories.\n\nAn electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories is a device intended to remove tissue and control bleeding by use of high-frequency electrical current.\n\nElectrosurgical devices under this regulation are indicated for general tissue cutting and/or coagulation. If your device has specific indications, it may require additional information (e.g., additional bench and/or clinical data) or may be found to have a new intended use. For more information on this topic, refer to FDA's \"Guidance for Industry: General/Specific Intended Use,\"3\n\nFootnote 3: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/generalspecific-intended-use-guidance-industry.\n\nThere are electrosurgical devices that have been classified under other medical panels (e.g., 21 CFR part 872 for dental devices). This guidance is not applicable to devices classified under the following regulations:\n\nSection 872.4920 Dental electrosurgical unit and accessories\n\nSection 876.4300 Endoscopic electrosurgical unit and accessories\n\nSection 882.4400 Radiofrequency lesion generator\n\nSection 882.4725 Radiofrequency lesion probe\n\nSection 884.4150 Bipolar endoscopic coagulator-cutter and accessories\n\nSection 884.4160 Unipolar endoscopic coagulator-cutter and accessories\n\nSection 886.4100 Radiofrequency electrosurgical cautery apparatus\n\nSection 886.4115 Thermal cautery unit\n\nThis guidance is applicable to electrosurgical devices that may have multiple uses or indications, if one of those indications includes tissue cutting and/or coagulation. In addition, some electrosurgical devices may include both open and minimally invasive uses; in those cases, this guidance document would apply. This guidance also applies to devices that may include an arthroscopic indication. In addition, please be aware that there is supplemental guidance for electrosurgical devices for other specific indications (e.g., RF vessel sealers). In such instances, the supplemental guidance may provide additional recommendations or supersede this guidance. We recommend that you search FDA's guidance database4 for any device specific supplemental guidance or contact the Division of General Surgery Devices for more information.\n\nFootnote 4: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFor a new device that combines an electrosurgical device with another device(s) (e.g., mechanical massager or low level light source) into a single system, and is designed to operate simultaneously or in sequence to achieve a desired clinical effect in tissue, additional data areusually necessary to demonstrate that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices working independently. We recommend that you contact the Agency through the Q-submission process to obtain further guidance for data recommendations in such cases. For information on the Q-submission process, see FDA's guidance, \"Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.\"5\n\nFootnote 5: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nIII Device Description\n\nWe recommend that you identify your device by the applicable regulation number described in Section II and include the following information:\n\nIndications for Use\n\nYou should provide a clear statement of your device's Indications for Use. The Indications for Use as stated on the Indications for Use Statement page should be identical to that in the 510(k) Summary (if provided in lieu of a 510(k) Statement) and the device labeling. You should also state if the device is a prescription (including home use) or over-the-counter (OTC) device, and indicate this accordingly on the Indications for Use Statement page.\n\nDevice Design\n\nYou should provide a brief description of the device's operating principle(s) and mechanism of action for achieving the intended effects. If the device will be labeled for use with multiple components or accessories, and the components/accessories are part of the submission, you should provide a list of all components/accessories with accompanying model numbers and/or part numbers. For the purpose of this guidance, components/accessories of electrosurgical devices refer to the electrosurgical unit (ESU), active component/active accessory, neutral electrode, and miscellaneous components/accessories. If there are components/accessories that have received prior 510(k) clearance or are exempted from the 510(k) requirement, you should provide the 510(k) numbers or indicate their exemption status, respectively.\n\nYou should provide the following information regarding device design:\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Electrosurgical Devices for General Surgery Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.509035110473633"], "Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Urgent public health need. Diagnostics with a public health impact can address unmet medical needs for both individual patients through early diagnosis, as well as informing the public health response by providing more detailed, timely information on disease incidence. These types of diagnostic assays can provide information on timing of infections (e.g., whether infection occurred within the last 6 months or further into the past). Individuals in the early stage of disease are at highest risk of transmission to their partners, and treatment and contact tracing can be effective in lowering risk. However, in the past, significant barriers existed for properly evaluating the performance of these tests in clinical cohorts. By allowing postmarket data collection to better confirm these tests' medical benefits, uncertainties in the timing of infection can be validated while significantly streamlining the review process for devices with such a public health design scope.\n\nMigration. Migration is an approach used for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrated to another system for which FDA has not evaluated assay performance. The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived for the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an already marketed system. This paradigm uses smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance. For more information, see Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidanc eDocuments/ucm092752.pdf. (\\circ) Example: The migration paradigm is often used on Class III devices for hepatitis to support device performance when the previously approved assay is transferred to a new instrument platform.\n\nConfirm mitigation effectiveness for a known risk in a post-approval study. Mitigations may be necessary for known safety risks associated with use of the device. Confirmation of the adequacy of the mitigation may be evaluated post-approval if mitigation of the risk is not fundamental to FDA's determination at the time of approval that the probable benefits outweigh the probable risks of the device. (\\circ) Example: After a permanent implant was recalled due to failures that could lead to death, a firm developed a novel software feature aimed at predicting those failures. The firm intends to incorporate that feature into its submission for a permanent implant intended for the same use as the recalled implant, which was marketed by a different company. The ability to predict failures would alert at-risk patients to see their clinician (and address the concern) prior to a life-threatening event. FDA might typically expect clinical data in a PMA to support this type of feature before approval. However, due to the public health need, FDA worked with the firm to use modeling on the novel software feature coupled with evaluation of published data to support premarket approval of the PMA. Clinical data on devices with the software feature were collected postmarket in a post-approval study, which was completed in a timely fashion after approval of the PMA. (\\circ) Example: For pacing and defibrillation leads, the degree of the changes in the products themselves and the potential impact to patient safety of those changes can affect the collection of data premarket and postmarket. For major changes (e.g., a completely new design, including new materials, new arrangement of those materials, and/or new connections) there will likely be more questions about impacts to patient safety, and thus a more rigorous set of premarket data (and a smaller degree of uncertainty) would be required before approval as compared to a lead with only minor changes. For example, even when a lead is new or significantly modified, FDA generally only requires 6 months to 2 years of data with a longer post-approval study to demonstrate long-term performance since the safety risks are well known.\n\nModify warnings, contraindications, precautions in approved labeling. Post-approval studies may be designed to collect further data on specific adverse events or event types for which there was limited knowledge during premarket review (e.g., small number of adverse events that occur within a subpopulation or uncertainty relating to the probability of minor adverse events), and the review of the postmarket data may result in revision of the warning, contraindications and/or precautions in the labeling.\n\nExample: When an in vitro diagnostic device is capable of detecting both common and rare targets (e.g., mutations or pathogens), the rare targets may be challenging to evaluate clinically in a timely manner. Such tests may be approved based on robust pre-clinical and clinical data for the common target(s) with masking of the rare target(s) not adequately supported by the data. Masking involves software programming that prevents the user from viewing results for specific targets, and allows the test to reach the market before adequate data on rare targets are available. Sponsors may continue to evaluate the rare targets postmarket to support unmasking. This process thus allows collection of additional clinical data to support the final approval of the device for all targets.\n\nExample: When quadripolar lead connectors were introduced, FDA worked with sponsors to capture clinical data in both the premarket and postmarket settings in combination with premarket animal study data and bench testing.\n\nWhere the performance of a particular device type is well-studied, documented, and understood. It may be possible to approve a new device or a new indication for an existing device based on safety and effectiveness information already known about the device or device type.\n\nClinical data that may be sufficient in cases like this include Objective Performance Criteria (OPC), Performance Goals (PG), Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), or other data in lieu of a randomized controlled clinical trial.\n\nExample: A sponsor is seeking approval of a 7-day extended wear lens. The same lens was approved for daily wear and the sponsor has a substantial marketing history in the U.S. for the daily wear lens. If the 7-day lens is made of the same material as the daily wear lens, FDA may consider transferring a clinical study to assess most aspects of device safety to the postmarket setting.\n\nWhere long-term outside the U.S. (OUS) clinical performance data is available but not sufficient. It may be possible to defer to postmarket or otherwise limit the collection of clinical data from patients in the U.S. followed by a post-approval study if data from outside the U.S. is available and provides reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFDA's Expedited Access for Devices Guidance20 also describes circumstances under which FDA may consider it acceptable to collect certain data in the postmarket setting, rather than premarket, while still ensuring that the statutory standard for premarket approval of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness is met. As part of the Expedited Access Pathway program described in the Expedited Access for Devices Guidance, in order to facilitate earlier patient access to devices that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need, FDA may accept a higher degree of uncertainty about the benefit-risk profile of the device at the time of approval by collecting certain data in the postmarket setting rather than premarket. Please reference the Expedited Access Pathway guidance for more information about how FDA may be willing to accept greater uncertainty.\n\nFDA believes it is important to routinely reassess whether data that the Agency receives in a premarket submission for a device type may instead be collected postmarket or if the data are no longer necessary for FDA to determine that there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device type. Sponsors who believe that the extent of data FDA previously expected in a premarket submission for the device type for which they plan to submit a PMA should be collected postmarket or should no longer be required, should submit a Pre-Submission (\"Pre-Sub\"),21 as described in FDA's guidance, \"Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff\"22 (\"Pre-Sub Guidance\").23\n\nFootnote 21: Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, added by section 1136 of FDASIA, requires applicants to include an electronic copy of certain submission types, including PMA submissions and Pre-Subs, after issuance of final guidance implementing that provision. FDA issued the guidance eCopy Program for Medical Devices Submissions (available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM313794.pdf), on December 31, 2012.

If you have questions about a device licensed by CBER, you may go to the CBER website for published guidance\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/default.htm) or contact CBER for further information on applicable guidance and regulations. (See Introduction, Section II, question # 4, of this guidance for a listing of CBER contact numbers).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Introduction\n\n1. What is the purpose of this guidance document and how does it differ from other guidance documents related to IVD products?\n\nFDA prepared this comprehensive document as a resource for you and for its own staff to address issues concerning IVD studies. This guidance document contains information relevant to studies conducted during the development of a new IVD product, as well as other general considerations about applicable requirements and marketing of the new device. It addresses particularly those investigational studies that are exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR Part 812. IVD study investigators and members of IRBs who review and approve such studiesmay also find it helpful. There are also device-specific guidance documents available for specific IVD products that can be found at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfggp/search.cfm. The use of\n\ninvestigational IVD devices in clinical studies designed to evaluate new drug products falls outside the scope of this guidance.\n\n2 Why are in vitro diagnostics considered devices?\n\nIn vitro diagnostics (IVDs) meet the definition of a device under the Act. Section 201(h) of the Act defines a device as:\n\n\"an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is--\n\n(1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United\n\nStates Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,\n\n(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions,\n\nor in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in\n\nman or other animals, or\n\n(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of\n\nman or other animals, and\n\nwhich does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical\n\naction within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not\n\ndependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary\n\nintended purposes.\" 21 U.S.C. 321(h) (emphasis added).\n\n3 How do IVD devices differ from other devices?\n\nMost other devices function on or in a patient. In contrast, IVDs include products\n\nused to collect specimens, or to prepare or examine specimens (e.g., blood, serum, urine, spinal fluid, tissue samples) after they are removed from the human body.\n\n4 Which Divisions at FDA are responsible for review of IVD products?\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Chemistry and Toxicology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5470\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Immunology and Hematology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5481\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Microbiology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5461\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Cell, Tissues, and Gene Therapy (OCTGT) - Phone: (301) 827-5102\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Blood Applications (DBA) - Phone: (301) 827-3524DBA schedules all review-related meetings for OBRR\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Emerging and Transfusion Transmitted Diseases\n\n(DETTD) - Phone: (301) 827-3008\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Hematology (DH) - Phone: (301) 496-4396\n\n5.

For example:\n\n610.40, Test Requirements (Testing Requirements for Communicable\n\nDisease Agents)\n\n610.42, Restrictions on Use for Further Manufacture of Medical Devices\n\n2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.0077168941497803", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Assay Migration Studies for\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostic Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA\n\nStaff\n\nDocument issued on: April 25, 2013\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on January 5, 2009.\n\nFor questions regarding this document contact Sally Hojvat, PhD, CDRH/OIR/DMD, by phone at (301) 796-5455, or by email at sally.hojvat@fda.hhs.gov or Marina V.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA's regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term \"new system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term \"old system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA's Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.8353163003921509", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Study - as used in this document, covers the systematic evaluations conducted in the development of an IVD product, including the feasibility, analytical assessments, method comparison, and evaluations to determine clinical utility of a product.\n\nSubject - a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used or as a control. A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nSurplus samples - see excess samples.\n\nTransitional device - a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)).\n\nTreatment IDE - use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions regulation at 21 CFR 812.36.\n\nTruth Standard (\"Gold\" Standard) - any medical procedure or laboratory method or combination of procedures and methods that the clinical community relies upon for diagnosis, that is accepted by FDA, and that is regarded as having negligible risk of either a false positive or a false negative result. The truth standard result should be definitive (positive/negative, present/absent, or diseased/non-diseased), and should not give an indeterminate result. As science and technology improve, newer, more reliable standards may replace previous standards, particularly in the case of new disease markers.\n\nVIII.

For the assays addressed by this guidance, positive results do not rule out potential co-infection with other pathogens, and negative results should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or patient management decisions.\n\nThis guidance provides detailed information on the types of data FDA recommends submitting in support of Class II premarket devices. The inclusion of certain analytes could elevate the classification of the device to Class III, and we encourage sponsors to contact the FDA for additional guidance.1 In addition, if you plan to seek clearance or approval for a microbiology multiplexed device that detects less than 20 organisms/targets, please contact the Agency prior to undertaking any clinical or analytical validation studies to discuss whether the recommendations found within this guidance may be applicable.\n\nFootnote 1: Certain analytes are inherently high risk, including some that are insufficiently understood to authoritatively identify the risks, and therefore belong in class III. A device that tests multiple analytes takes on the classification of the highest class analyte.\n\n4 Risks to Health\n\nThe potential risks to health associated with HMMDs that are used in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and other laboratory tests to aid in the diagnosis of infection include: failure of the device to perform as indicated, leading to inaccurate results or lack of results, and incorrect interpretation of results. These potential risks may lead to incorrect patient management decisions.\n\nA false positive result could lead to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment for the misidentified illness, as well as delayed treatment of the actual infection, which may potentially lead to a more serious infection. Additionally, a false positive result in the context of a public health emergency could lead to misallocation of resources used for surveillance and prevention. A false negative result, or lack of result, could lead to failure to provide a diagnosis and the correct treatment, may contribute to unnecessary treatment, or incorrect patient management to prevent transmission of infection.\n\n5 Device Description\n\nIn your 510(k) submission, you should identify the regulation, the product code(s), and a legally marketed predicate device(s). We recommend you include a table that outlines the similarities and differences between the predicate or multiple predicates and your device. You should include the following descriptive information to adequately characterize your highly multiplexed microbiological/medical countermeasure device.\n\nIntended Use\n\nThe intended use should specify the pathogens and, if applicable, drug resistance markers that the test detects and identifies, the nature of the analyte (e.g., RNA, DNA, or both RNA and DNA), specimen types for which testing will be indicated, the clinical indications for which the test is to be used, and the specific population(s) for which the test is intended. The intended use should state that the test is qualitative or quantitative, whether detection of an analyte is presumptive, and any specific conditions of use.\n\nIn your 510(k), you should clearly include the following information related to the intended use of your product:\n\nThe identity, phylogenetic relationship, or other recognized characterization of the pathogens that your device is designed to detect.\n\nHow the device results might be used in a diagnostic algorithm if applicable. Additional measures that might be needed for a laboratory identification and diagnosis of the infection.\n\nAdditional measures that should be instituted if infection with a novel or emerging pathogen is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria.\n\n2 Test Methodology\n\nYou should describe, in detail, the methodology used by your device. You should describe the following elements, at a minimum, as applicable to your device:\n\nTest platform (e.g., multiplexed RT-PCR, bead arrays, re-sequencing array, mass spectrometry used in conjunction with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)).\n\nInformation and rationale for selection of specific target sequences and the methods used to design detection elements.\n\nSpecim collection (e.g., swabs, viral culture media, positive blood culture, etc.) and handling methods.\n\nSpecim matrix (e.g., blood, sputum, stool, etc.).\n\nAll pre-analytical methods and instrumentation for collection, stabilization, and concentration of specimens.\n\nSpecificity of the pathogen sequences being detected (i.e., methodologies used in addition to the evaluation of clinical specificity to demonstrate the target sequence is found only in the pathogen of interest).\n\nLimiting factors of the assay (e.g., saturation level, maximum cycle number, etc.).\n\nReagent components provided or recommended for use, and their function within the system (e.g., buffers, enzymes, fluorescent dyes, chemiluminescent reagents, oligonucleotides, other signaling/amplification reagents, etc).\n\nThe potential for specific and non-specific interference effects from reagents or device material.\n\nInternal controls and a description of their specific function in the system.\n\nExternal controls that you recommend or provide to users.\n\nInstrumentation inherent to using your device, including the components and their function within the system.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe signal analysis and interpretation from raw data to the reported result (e.g., how raw signals are processed and converted into a useable result). This would include sufficient software controls for identifying and dealing with obvious problems in the dataset. It would also include adjustment for background and normalization, if applicable.\n* Illustrations, photographs, and a detailed description of non-standard equipment or methods, if available.\n* Design inputs and outputs with a risk analysis and traceability matrix.\n\nWhen applicable, you should include descriptions of how your device's features address or mitigates risks associated with highly multiplexed devices such as the following examples:\n\nPrevention of cross-contamination for multiplexed tests in which many probes are included in the device.\n\nCorrect placement and identity of assay features (e.g., probes, arrayed capture oligos).\n\nMinimization of false positive results due to contamination or carryover of specimen.\n\nHow to enable detection of emerging variants due to mutations within the target organism.\n\nProcess controls used to detect and/or correct long term drift in device performance due to antigenic drift.\n\nAppendix C Ancillary Reagents\n\nAncillary reagents are those reagents that a manufacturer of HMMDs specifies in device labeling as \"required but not provided\" in order to carry out the assay as indicated in its instructions for use and to achieve the test performance claimed in labeling for the assay. For the purposes of this document, specific ancillary reagents are those that you specify with a catalog or product number, or other specific designation as necessary for your device to achieve its labeled performance characteristics. For example, if your device labeling specifies the use of a specific brand of reagent (e.g., 'Brand X or other amplification enzyme that has been shown to be equivalent') and the use of any other DNA amplification enzyme may alter the performance characteristics of your device from that reported in your labeling, then Brand X DNA amplification enzyme or other amplification enzymes shown to be equivalent to Brand X DNA amplification enzyme are ancillary reagents of concern for the purposes of this document.2\n\nFootnote 2: Even if you establish that one or more alternative ancillary reagents may be used in your assay, each of those named alternatives may still be an ancillary reagent. If you are unsure whether this aspect of the guidance applies to your device, we recommend you consult with the Division of Microbiology Devices in the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.\n\nBy contrast, if your device requires the use of 95% ethanol, and any type of 95% ethanol will allow your device to achieve the performance characteristics provided in your labeling, then 95% ethanol is not an ancillary reagent for the purposes of this document.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Highly Multiplexed Microbiological:Medical Countermeasure In Vitro Nucleic Acid Based Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.4877095222473145", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n\nWhere available, assay performance at low positive analyte levels usingdilution panels should be based on international standards (e.g., World Health Organization (WHO) standards, Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) standards) and compared with the old system.\n\nIf available and appropriate, test well-characterized seroconversion panels similar in number and type to the panels originally used to support approval/licensure/clearance. The seroconversion panels should be run on both the old system and the new system.\n\n3.2.2 Precision\n\nThis section describes precision study designs including panel composition.\n\n(i) Composition of Precision Panel\n\nThe categorical result of a qualitative test is determined using the numeric test data and a cutoff(s) (e.g., a numeric threshold), which define numeric ranges that correspond to the final result categories. For a qualitative test with two categorical results, a cutoff (one threshold) is used to define positive and negative results of the test. When the observed numeric test data exceeds the threshold, the final result is considered positive (or \"reactive\", \"detected\"). When the observed numeric test result is below the cutoff, it is considered negative (or \"not reactive\", \"not detected\").\n\nQualitative assays discriminating between two classes of subjects (non-diseased vs diseased) can fall into two groups: 1) assays used in situations where non- diseased subject samples have a true zero concentration of the analyte of interest, and 2) assays used in situations where non-diseased subject samples have a detectable analyte concentration. For the latter, the cutoff was chosen to optimize clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay based on a clinical data set. Appropriate precision panels for these two types of assays, as well as assays that produce equivocal results, and/or have a re-test zone, are discussed in more detail in (a)-(c), below:\n\n(a) When non-diseased subject samples have a detectable amount of analyte.\n\nFor the non-diseased subject samples that have a detectable amount of analyte the cutoff of the assay is higher than the limit of the blank. A useful characteristic of the cutoff is that a sample with a concentration (determined by the mean signal to cutoff value from a large a series of replicate measurements) at the cutoff yields a positive result 50% of the time and a negative result 50% of the time when a large number of replicates of that sample are run under stipulated conditions (see Figure 1 below). We denote this concentration as C({}_{50}).\n\nFor samples with concentrations exceeding C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results more than 50% of the time, and similarly for samples with a concentration below C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results less than 50% of the time. In this guidance we refer to an analyte concentration that yields, upon evaluating many replicates, a positive result 95% of the time (and a negative result 5% of the time) as a Low Positive concentration (C({}{95}) concentration). We refer to a sample concentration which yields a positive result 5% of the time (and negative result 95% of the time) as a High Negative concentration (C({}{5}) concentration). Samples with concentrations of analyte close to C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) as determined by the old system are recommended for the within-laboratory precision (see CLSI8 document EP12). The panel should consist of at least four members, as described below (also, see Figure 2):\n\nFootnote 8: Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. CLSI documents referenced in this guidance are listed in Section XI of this document.\n\nA True Negative sample: a sample with a true analyte concentration of zero.\n\nA High Negative sample: a sample that repeatedly tests negative approximately 95% of the time and positive 5% of the time by the old system. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce negative results approximately 95% of\n\nFigure 1: Results of a qualitative assay (probability density function) for a sample with a concentration at the cutoff measured multiple times.\n\nthe time (C({}{5}) concentration as determined by the old system).\n* A Low Positive sample: a sample with an analyte concentration around C({}{95}) as determined by the old system. Repeatedly testing this sample by the old system should give a positive result approximately 95% of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce positive results approximately 95% of the time. Note that if the LoB is used as a cutoff, then the concentration C({}_{95}) is the same as the LoD.\n* A Moderate Positive sample: a sample with a concentration close to the cutoff, and at which one observes positive results by the old system approximately 100% of the time (e.g., a sample with a signal approximately two to three times the signal at the cutoff if the cutoff=1.0, or a sample with concentration approximately two to three times the 95% LoD if the cutoff is based on LoB).\n\nFor the details of how the C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) concentrations can be evaluated from the previous precision studies of the old system, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1. For the precision study of the new system, it is not necessary to have the High Negative and Low Positive samples at exactly C({}{5}) or C({}{95}) of the old system. If the High Negative and Low Positive samples in the precision study of the new system are close enough to the cutoff that the standard\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between percent of positive results and the analyte cutoff concentration.\n\ndeviation (or percent coefficient of variation (CV) is approximately constant over the range around the cutoff, the C({}{5}) and C({}{95}) of the new system can be evaluated from this precision study (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1).\n\n(b) When non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration.\n\nWhen non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration there are two types of assays: (1) assays for which samples with zero concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the cutoff of the assay is the limit of blank (with some type I error, for example, 5%); and (2) ultrasensitive assays for which samples with zero analyte concentration almost always have a negative assay result (type I error is close to zero). These two types of assays are discussed further in the two bullets below.\n\nConsider assays where samples with zero analyte concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the limit of blank is used as a cutoff. In this case the concentration C({}{95}) is the same as the limit of detection (LoD) and zero concentration (no analyte present in sample) is C({}{5}) as illustrated in Figure 3, below. The precision panel should consist of at least the following three members: True Negative, Low Positive (around LoD) and Moderately Positive.\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between the percent of positive results and the analyte concentration where True Negative samples produce numeric results and the C({}_{95}) concentration is the LoD of the assay.\n\nFor ultrasensitive assays that employ, for example, a signal amplification methodology (e.g., real-time PCR), the following approaches for precision panel members are recommended. For ultrasensitive assays, the concentration range that spans High Negative (around C({}{5})) to Low Positive (around C({}{95})=LoD) is narrow with respect to the observed concentration range of clinical specimens. Due to this narrow range, it may be difficult to prepare a sample with C({}{5}) concentration. If less than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples at the C({}{5}) concentration could be excluded from the precision panel. In this case, samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})) and Moderately Positive. If more than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})), samples in the range of C({}{20}) to C({}{80}) and Moderately Positive as illustrated in Figure 4, below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.1264021396636963"], "From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Cotains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ7: How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n\nA7: Where alternate tools are not available, insufficient, or otherwise will not satisfy the need for an inspection, FDA will use a risk-based approach to prioritize inspections, which includes consideration for (a) how product availability could impact public health; (b) investigator safety; and (c) travel restrictions and/or advisories associated with the location of the facility or site (e.g., country or region/state/province within the country, U.S. state, county, or territory). FDA will also seek to minimize, though not necessarily avoid, missing additional application goal dates due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 public health emergency. These objectives will also be balanced with the effort to reduce any backlog of assigned inspections.\n\nAppendix B Manufacturing and Supply Chain Change Requests\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.\n\nQ8: How do I add or change a facility in my application in response to supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA8: Refer to the established guidance documents listed in section V. References, for changing or adding a facility to your application.\n\nIf your marketing application19 relates to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 or to a drug that is on FDA's drug shortage list,20 the cover letter to the submission should clearly state \"Priority Review Requested\" and should include information to support your priority review designation request. If the product could enter, or is currently in drug shortage, also contact CDER DRUG SHORTAGES (DRUGSHORTAGES(rFDA.HHS.GOV). See https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/drug-shortages for more information. For products regulated by CBER, contact cbershortage(r)fda.hhs.gov. Except as described above, FDA intends to continue following the procedures outlined in relevant Manuals of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) and Standard Operating Procedures and Policies (SOPPs).21\n\nQ9: What data are required to support manufacturing process or facility changes needed to address disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA9: Refer to the Agency's existing guidance documents on making changes to an approved marketing application, as well as scale-up and postapproval change guidance documents for specific dosage forms (see section V. References). Should circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic warrant atypical or flexible submission strategies, for CDER-regulated products, contact CDER-OPQ-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov; for CBER-regulated products, contact the office responsible for the product's regulation for further assistance.\n\nQ10: How can the implementation of postapproval manufacturing changes to an ANDA, NDA, or BLA for products needed during the COVID-19 pandemic be accelerated?\n\nA10: FDA is using multiple tools to facilitate implementation of manufacturing changes such as risk-based reduction in supplement reporting categories and flexible assessment practices.\n\nConsistent with FDA's regulations for marketing applications related to postapproval chemistry, manufacturing, and controls changes, FDA may consider available information and approaches to mitigate the risk to product quality associated with the change to support a reporting category for certain supplements that is lower than what otherwise would be most suitable (if such information and risk-mitigation approaches were not provided). During this public health emergency, FDA is willing to consider requests from applicants to submit certain changes using a lower reporting category based on such risk-mitigation information for marketing applications related to products in shortage or intended to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent COVID-19.\n\nBefore submitting a supplement with a lower reporting category, applicants should contact FDA for feedback and concurrence. For CDER-regulated products, applicants should contact CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to describe how we will request and conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations at facilities2 where drugs3 are manufactured, processed, packed, or held; facilities covered under FDA's bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) program; and outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 2: In this guidance, the term facility covers persons, sites, and establishments subject to FDA drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring regulations and statutory authority.\n\nFootnote 3: In this guidance, the term drug includes biologics.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nconduct an evaluation. In this guidance, we refer to our use of any combination of these interactive tools as a remote interactive evaluation. FDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation prior to or following other types of regulatory oversight activities (e.g., an inspection or a request for records or other information).7\n\nFootnote 7: A remote interactive evaluation is not the same as an inspection as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or a request for records or other information in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. Similarly, a remote interactive evaluation or a request under section 704(a)(4) does not constitute an inspection for purposes of section 510(h)(3) of the FD&C Act. Section 704(a)(4) does not apply to every inspection program covered by this guidance (e.g., section 704(a)(4) does not apply to the BIMO inspection program). Failure to cooperate with either an inspection or a 704(a)(4) request for records or other information may constitute a limiting of inspection and as a result, FDA may deem the relevant drugs manufactured at these establishments adulterated. See the guidance for industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection (October 2014) for further information.\n\nIII Planning a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nFDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation whenever a program office determines it is appropriate based on mission needs and any travel limitations. FDA conducts inspections for many purposes and programs, and we will consider each of those inspection program areas as possible candidates for a remote interactive evaluation. This policy applies to all drug inspection programs including, but not limited to:\n\nPre-Approval Inspections (PAIs) and Pre-License Inspections (PLIs): FDA may perform a PAI or PLI to assess a marketing application. FDA uses these inspections to ensure that any facility named or referenced in support of an application can perform the proposed manufacturing operations in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to verify conformance with the application, and to confirm that data submitted in the application are accurate and complete.\n\nPost-Approval Inspections (PoAIs): PoAIs focus on a specific drug and changes to its manufacturing operations, the evaluation of process validation, any changes submitted to the application, and the execution of supporting activities according to application commitments and CGMP requirements.\n\nSurveillance Inspections: Surveillance drug quality inspections examine overall operations, including controls that ensure manufacturing processes produce quality drugs, thereby reducing the risk of adulterated or misbranded drugs reaching consumers and patients. FDA uses surveillance inspections to evaluate the CGMP compliance of manufacturing operations. Surveillance inspections are performed at active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing facilities, as well as outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollow-Up and Compliance Inspections: When a specific drug quality problem or facility issue comes to FDA's attention, we may initiate a follow-up or compliance drug quality inspection. For example, FDA may conduct an inspection to investigate: (1) product safety, effectiveness, or quality concerns arising from defect reports; (2) information provided by an informant about a facility; (3) violata facility that were discovered during the inspection of another facility; or (4) corrective actions undertaken by a facility in response to, for example, a warning letter or regulatory meeting.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.820199489593506", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Policy for Certain REMS Requirements During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry and Health Care Professionals\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023.

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to communicate its temporary policy for certain risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) requirements for the duration of the public health emergency (PHE) declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)1 on January 31, 2020.2Given this PHE, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because the FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance describes the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and that has now been detected in many locations internationally, including cases in the United States. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a PHE related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.3 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency in response to COVID-19.4\n\nFootnote 3: Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists. (Jan. 31, 2020), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/2019-nCoV.aspx).\n\nFootnote 4: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), _available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/_Section 505-1 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1) authorizes FDA to require REMS for certain drugs5 if FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.6, 7, 8\n\nFootnote 5: Section 505-1 of the FD&C Act applies to applications for prescription drugs submitted or approved under subsections 505(b) (i.e., new drug applications) or (j) (i.e., abbreviated new drug applications) of the FD&C Act and to applications submitted or approved under section 351 (i.e., biologics license applications) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262). For the purposes of this document, unless otherwise specified, the term drug refers to human prescription drugs, including those that are licensed as biological products (biologics).\n\nFootnote 6: Public Law 110-85, September 27, 2007, available at https://www.spo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ85/html/PLAAW-110publ85.htm, accessed November 19, 2018.\n\nA REMS may include a Medication Guide, a patient package insert, a communication plan, and/or certain packaging and safe disposal technologies for drugs that pose a serious risk of abuse or overdose.9 FDA also may require certain elements to assure safe use (ETASU) as part of the REMS for a drug.10\n\nFootnote 7: Public Law 112-144, July 9, 2012, available at http://www.spo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ144/pdf/PLAW-112publ144.pdf, accessed November 19, 2018.\n\nFootnote 8: See Section 505-1(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 9: Section 505-1(e)(2)-(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See Section 505-1(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSpecifically, ETASU may include one or any combination of the following requirements11:\n\nFootnote 11: See Section 505-1(f)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nHealth care providers who prescribe the drug have particular training or experience, or are specially certified;\n\nPharmacies, practitioners, or health care settings that dispense the drug are specially certified;\n\nThe drug be dispensed to patients only in certain health care settings, such as hospitals;\n\nThe drug be dispensed to patients with evidence or other documentation of safe use conditions, such as laboratory test results;\n\nEach patient using the drug be subject to monitoring; or\n\nEach patient using the drug be enrolled in a registry.\n\nIf a REMS includes certain ETASU, the REMS may also include an implementation system to enable the applicant to monitor, evaluate, and improve the implementation of the elements (e.g.,development of a REMS-specific website or call center to facilitate enrollment; establishment of electronic databases of certified health care settings).12\n\nFootnote 12: See Section 505-1(f)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nFor a limited number of drugs that are subject to a REMS with ETASU, the REMS requires laboratory testing (e.g., liver enzyme testing) or imaging studies (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging) under sections 505-1(f)(3)(d) or (e) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1 (f)(3)(d) or (e)).\n\nFDA recognizes that during the COVID-19 PHE, completion of REMS-required laboratory testing or imaging studies may be difficult because patients may need to avoid public places and patients suspected of having COVID-19 may be self-isolating and/or subject to quarantine. Under these circumstances, undergoing laboratory testing or imaging studies in order to obtain a drug subject to a REMS can put patients and others at risk for transmission of the coronavirus.\n--------------------\nContext title: Policy for Certain REMS Requirements During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry and Health Care Professionals MARCH 2020\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.5377118587493896", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023.

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions about regulatory and policy issues related to inspections, pending drug applications, and changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.1 This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in August 2020, and revised in January 2021.\n\nFootnote 1: In this guidance, the terms drug and pharmaceutical product include biological products.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nFDA has issued guidance on how to implement manufacturing process and facility changes; relevant guidances that describe the process for reporting changes to an application can be found in section V. References. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) remain fully capable of continuing daily activities, such as application assessments, including facility evaluation and certain inspection activities, while responding to public health needs related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible.\n\nInspections\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to inspections for facilities manufacturing pharmaceutical products and sites involved in the conduct of clinical, analytical, and nonclinical studies.\n\nQ1: How are inspections impacted by COVID-19?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system\" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only \"mission-critical\" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. For the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses.6 This helps ensure the safety of the investigator and the firm's employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish FDA's regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCurrently, certain inspections (e.g., foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical) remain temporarily postponed.\n\nWhile inspections that can be conducted by FDA during the public health emergency are limited due to factors including travel restrictions, FDA intends to continue using alternative tools, when appropriate, to evaluate facilities. This includes requesting existing inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements,7 requesting information from applicants, requesting records and other information directly from facilities and other inspected entities, and conducting remote interactive evaluations8 where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n\nA2: FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3687413930892944", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023, unless superseded by a revised final guidance before that date.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help address current manufacturing limitations or supply chain issues due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of HHS on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled \"Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019,\" _available at_https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidancedocument is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\nThe contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19, effective January 27, 2020, and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists (originally issued on Jan. 31, 2020, and subsequently renewed) available at\n\nhttps://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx..\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://trumpwhithouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak /. On February 24, 2021, there was a Presidential Declaration continuing the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic beyond March 1, 2021. See Continuation of the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic (February 24, 2021), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/26/2021-04173/continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic._\n\nCOVID-19 has demonstrated the capability to spread rapidly, leading to significant impacts on health care systems and causing societal disruption. The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States including reduced availability of components and materials used in device manufacturing, as well as temporary closure of manufacturing facilities. Due to these and other COVID-19 related developments, numerous manufacturers may need to make immediate changes such as adjusting manufacturing processes to allow for social distancing, adapting their manufacturing or design due to supply chain disruption, or to moving device production to a region that is less impacted by COVID-19. To help foster the continued availability of medical devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to limited modifications to the design and manufacturing of devices approved through either a PMA or HDE without prior submission of a PMA or HDE supplement or 30-day notice for the duration of the public health emergency.\n\nAs discussed below, this policy applies to limited modifications affecting the safety or effectiveness of a device approved through the PMA program that would trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a PMA supplement or 30-day notice to FDA per section 515(d)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 814.39.3This policy also applies to limited modifications affecting the safety or probable benefit of a device approved through the HDE program which would trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit an HDE supplement or 30-day notice to FDA per 21 CFR 814.108.4\n\nFootnote 4: For additional information regarding HDE supplements, refer to the guidance document \u201cHumanitarian Device Exemption Program,\u201d _available at_https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-\n\nSupplements and 75-Day Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Supplements for Manufacturing Method or Process Changes,\u201d _available at_https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/30-day-notices-135-day-premarket-approval-pma-supplements-and-75-day-humanitarian-device-exemption.\n\nExamples of types of such modifications may include, but are not limited to:\n\nDesign and manufacturing changes to address component unavailability due to supply chain disruptions\n\nManufacturing changes to allow the establishment to maintain operations and accommodate social distancing practices\n\nChanges in manufacturing facility or establishment\n\nChanges to packaging procedures\n\nWe believe this policy may help address current manufacturing limitations or supply chain issues due to COVID-19 disruptions, such as adding production lines or manufacturing at alternative sites which may have different manufacturing equipment to increase manufacturing capacity and supply and/or reduce supply chain interruptions and manufacturing bottlenecks. The policy set forth in this guidance does not apply to design or manufacturing changes made for reasons other than addressing manufacturing limitations or supply chain issues resulting from the COVID-19 public health emergency or to any proposed changes described in a regulatory submission already received by FDA.\n\nThis document supersedes the guidance, \"Supplements for Approved Premarket Approval (PMA) or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Submissions During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency,\" issued May 2020. This version clarifies the examples of circumstances -- including changes made to microchips or other associated circuitry and/or software changes --where FDA currently believes a modification would generally not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency, and that may be needed to address current manufacturing limitations or supply chain issues due to COVID-19-related disruptions.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nIn developing this policy, FDA's intent is to help foster the continued availability of medical devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency while being flexible regarding limited modifications made to devices that are subject to review by FDA through either a PMA/HDE supplement or 30-day notice.\n\nTherefore, for the duration of the public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to limited modifications to the manufacturing of devices approved through the PMA program or the HDE program, without prior submission of the required PMA or HDE supplement or 30-day notice,4\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nAutomation of existing processes that are fully verified\n\nAutomation of certain processes, such as packaging and labeling processes to accommodate social distancing\n\nModifications to increase capacity (e.g., addition of manufacturing lines, equipment modifications to process multiple components, and continuous processing) in existing facilities approved as part of an original PMA or HDE application or a supplement\n--------------------\nContext title: Supplements for Approved Premarket Approval (PMA) or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Submissions During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (Revised) Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7044998407363892", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA recognizes that some facilities maintain documents in paper format and not all electronic systems will be accessible for direct viewing. Thus, when such a facility agrees to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, they should consider taking steps to enable FDA's remote viewing and verification of the facility's documents, procedures, and electronic systems. Requested documents maintained in paper format should be scanned as searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) files when possible.\n\nConcluding a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nUpon completion of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will have a closeout meeting with the facility's management. During this meeting, FDA will usually present a written list of observations, if any, and describe and discuss any observations in sufficient detail to enable understanding and foster an appropriate response.13 This written list of observations will not be a final Agency action or decision. FDA will not issue a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. As with an inspection, FDA encourages facilities to respond during the discussion and/or provide responses in writing to the observations within 15 U.S. business days.\n\nFootnote 13: If the remote interactive evaluation, including the review of any records before or during the evaluation, is intended to supplement a scheduled inspection, then FDA usually will combine any observations from the remote interactive evaluation(s) into a single written list of observations issued at the close of the inspection, which would be issued on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations.\n\nDepending on the purpose and outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, the information and documentation collected may be used to, among other regulatory purposes:\n\nSupport FDA's assessment of pending applications, including whether to approve an application\n\nPreclude the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or defect\n\nSupport a regulatory meeting, warning letter, import alert, recall activities, or enforcement action\n\nRank or prioritize a facility for an inspection, particularly a surveillance CGMP inspection\n\nJustify a follow-up or compliance inspection or any other surveillance activity\n\nAfter the remote interactive evaluation concludes, FDA will provide a copy of the final remote interactive evaluation report to the facility. A remote interactive evaluation report and any written list of observations may be subject to a disclosure request under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIf FDA determines that an inspection will be necessary based on the outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, we will use the information obtained from the remote interactive evaluation to prepare for and conduct the inspection.\n\nVI Impacts of Remote Interactive Evaluations on Established Commitments and Timeframes\n\nIn general, the use of remote interactive evaluations should help FDA operate within normal timeframes (i.e., in a similar manner as an inspection) as outlined below, especially for higher priority activities in spite of challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFDA intends to use information from a remote interactive evaluation to meet user fee commitments and to update FDA's relevant internal databases. FDA expects that a remote interactive evaluation will generally enable us to meet a user fee goal date. However, FDA will notify applicants if we expect to miss a user fee goal date.\n\nAppendix A Commitments for Pre-Approval and Pre-License Inspections\n\nFDA will adhere to existing response timeframes applicable to inspections.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the observations identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered in the application assessment if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication. FDA may defer consideration of responses or corrective actions in the current review cycle if received after 15 days.\n\nResponses received after 15 U.S. business days will be considered in the next application user fee cycle, should the application receive a complete response action and the facility requires re-evaluation.\n\nAppendix B Timeframes for All Inspection Types\n\nFDA generally intends to use existing timelines established for reporting on and evaluating the outcome of an inspection for the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the issues identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered with respect to further regulatory action if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication of the observations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.45989030599594116"], "Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: Providing Postmarketing Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) Guidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nNovember 2016\n\nDrug SafetyProviding Postmarketing Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) Guidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{\\text{th}}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: occod@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nNovember 2016\n\nDrug Safety\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Postmarketing Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) Guidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes the conditions under which applicants2 can use an alternative reporting format, the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)3 E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), in place of the U.S. periodic adverse drug experience report (PADER), U.S. periodic adverse experience report (PAER), or ICH E2C Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), to satisfy the periodic postmarketing safety reporting requirements in SSS 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2) (21 CFR 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2)). This guidance also describes the procedures applicants should follow if they wish to submit a PBRER in place of a PADER, PAER, or PSUR.4 The steps will differ, depending on whether or not the applicant has an approved waiver in place to substitute the PSUR for the PADER/PAER.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance uses the term applicant to mean the holder of an approved new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or biologics license application (BLA), which are referred to collectively in this guidance as applications.\n\nFootnote 3: Formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products for human use among regulators around the world (for more information about the ICH and the procedures for adopting harmonized guidelines, see http://www.ich.org/). Guidelines that have been formally endorsed by the ICH are implemented by the FDA in the form of FDA guidance documents whose development follows the procedures outlined in FDA\u2019s good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115).\n\nFootnote 4: FDA accepts all three formats, the PADER/PAER, PSUR, and PBRER, to fulfill the postmarketing periodic safety reporting requirements under \u00a7s 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2). Each format must be submitted according to the content and timelines specified in the regulations (PADER/PAER) or by ICH (PSUR and PBRER).\n\nII Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes the conditions under which applicants2 can use an alternative reporting format, the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)3 E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), in place of the U.S. periodic adverse drug experience report (PADER), U.S. periodic adverse experience report (PAER), or ICH E2C Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), to satisfy the periodic postmarketing safety reporting requirements in SSS 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2) (21 CFR 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2)). This guidance also describes the procedures applicants should follow if they wish to submit a PBRER in place of a PADER, PAER, or PSUR.4 The steps will differ, depending on whether or not the applicant has an approved waiver in place to substitute the PSUR for the PADER/PAER.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n600.80(c)(2)(ii)(A)(3), along with a copy of the U.S. labeling in effect on the data lock point (DLP)14 date.\n\nFootnote 14: The term data lock point refers to the date designated as the cut-off for data to be included in the PSUR or PBRER.\n\nFDA has routinely granted waivers to permit applicants to change the date of the DLP from the U.S. approval date, as required under SSS 314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i), to a different date for harmonization purposes. These waivers have been granted on the condition that the applicant ensures that there are no gaps in reporting resulting from the date change. FDA has also permitted applicants to include multiple products with the same active moiety or active ingredient in a single report as recommended in the ICH E2C(R1) guidance.\n\nGenerally, FDA has not waived the reporting frequencies required under SSS 314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i). However, FDA has permitted applicants to submit PSURs at longer intervals, consistent with the ICH guidelines, on the condition that the applicant submit a periodic safety report as needed to fulfill the reporting frequency requirements.\n\nExample: FDA granted an applicant a waiver to submit a PSUR for its drug product every 3 years. FDA granted this waiver on the condition that the applicant also submit an annual PADER for years 1 and 2 of the 3-year PSUR cycle.\n\n3 Procedures Applicants Should Follow to Submit a PBRER\n\nApplicants With a PSUR Waiver\n\nIf applicants already have a PSUR waiver for an approved application, FDA will consider the existing PSUR waiver to permit applicants to submit a PBRER instead of a PSUR under the conditions described below, because the PBRER replaces the PSUR for postmarketing periodic safety reporting. If applicants wish to substitute the PBRER for the PSUR with no changes in the DLP or frequency of reporting, applicants can do so without submitting a new waiver request. However, if applicants wish to change any conditions of their PSUR waiver other than the format, applicants should submit either a notification or new waiver request, depending on the circumstances described below.\n\n3.1.1 Change in the Date of the DLP for the PBRER - Submit Notification\n\nIf applicants wish to use a DLP date for the PBRER that is different than the DLP date used for the PSUR, applicants should ensure there are no gaps in reporting intervals resulting from the change in DLP. Examples of appropriate alternatives include the following:\n\nSubmit overlapping reports to cover the gap.\n\nSubmit a one-time PADER/PAER to cover the gap.\n\nExtend the reporting interval of the applicant's upcoming PADER/PAER by up to 3 months to cover the gap.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants should submit written notification to the application(s), indicating the change in DLP date and describing the measures taken to ensure that there are no resulting gaps in reporting.\n\nLonger PBRER Reporting Intervals But No Change in Frequency - Submit Notification\n\nIf applicants wish to submit the PBRER less frequently than is permitted under their PSUR waiver, the continued validity of the applicant's waiver will be conditioned on the applicant's submission of a PADER/PAER as needed to fulfill the reporting frequency requirement under our regulations.\n\nApplicants should submit written notification to the application, indicating this change and describing the measures taken to ensure that the periodicity requirements are being met.\n\nIf the applicant's PSUR waiver specifies annual PSUR submission but the applicant wishes to submit a PBRER every 3 years, the applicant can substitute the PBRER for the PSUR, provided the applicant submits a PADER/PAER for years 1 and 2 of the 3-year PBRER cycle to maintain the annual reporting frequency required under the regulations and as specified in its PSUR waiver.\n\nOther Changes to the PSUR Waiver - Submit New Waiver\n\nIf applicants wish to change any other condition of their PSUR waiver beyond what is described in sections III.A.1 and III.A.2 above, then applicants should submit a new waiver request. For example, a new waiver request should be submitted to change the overall reporting frequency or to add or remove products covered by the report.\n\nAppendix B Applicants Without a PSUR Waiver\n--------------------\nContext title: Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.474985122680664", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.9.2 Presentation\n\nThe recommended table of contents, including section numbering, for the PBRER is provided below:\n\nTitle Page\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nWorldwide Marketing Approval Status\n\nActions Taken in the Reporting Interval for Safety Reasons\n\nChanges to Reference Safety Information\n\nEstimated Exposure and Use Patterns 5.1 Cumulative Subject Exposure in Clinical Trials 5.2 Cumulative and Interval Patient Exposure from Marketing Experience\n\nData in Summary Tabulations 6.1 Reference Information 6.2 Cumulative Summary Tabulations of Serious Adverse Events from Clinical Trials 6.3 Cumulative and Interval Summary Tabulations from Post-Marketing Data Sources\n\nSummaries of Significant Findings from Clinical Trials during the Reporting Period 7.1 Completed Clinical Trials 7.2 Ongoing Clinical Trials7.3 Long-Term Follow-up 7.4 Other Therapeutic Use of Medicinal Product 7.5 New Safety Data Related to Fixed Combination Therapies\n8 Findings from Non-Interventional Studies\n9 Information from Other Clinical Trials and Sources\n10 Non-Clinical Data\n11 Literature\n12 Other Periodic Reports\n13 Lack of Efficacy in Controlled Clinical Trials\n14 Late-Breaking Information\n15 Overview of Signals: New, Ongoing, or Closed\n16 Signal and Risk Evaluation\n16.1 Summary of Safety Concerns\n16.2 Signal Evaluation\n16.3 Evaluation of Risks and New Information\n16.4 Characterisation of Risks\n16.5 Effectiveness of Risk Minimisation (if applicable)\n17 Benefit Evaluation\n17.1 Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information\n17.2 Newly Identified information on Efficacy/Effectiveness\n17.3 Characterisation of Benefits\n18 Integrated Benefit-Risk Analysis for Approved Indications\n18.1 Benefit-Risk Context - Medical Need and Important Alternatives\n18.2 Benefit-Risk Analysis Evaluation\n19 Conclusions and Actions\n20 Appendices\n\n3 Guidance on Contents of the PBRER\n\nAll sections should be completed, and when no information is available, this should be stated.

Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9729984402656555", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJuly 2016\n\nICHE2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n\n_Additional copies are available from: Office of Communications, Division of Drug Information Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4th Floor Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 Phone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353 Email: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm and/or Office of Communication, Outreach and Development Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128 Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 Phone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010 Email: ocod@fda.hhs.gov http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccinex/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJuly 2016\n\nICH\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nE2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report --\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance was developed within the Efficacy Implementation Working Group of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH process. The Q&As in this document have been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, March 2014. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan, and North America.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction (1)2\n\nFootnote 2: Arabic numbers reflect the organizational breakdown of the document endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, March 2014.\n\nThe ICH guidance E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) is intended to be a common standard for periodic benefit-risk evaluation reporting on marketed products among the ICH regions. The ICH E2C(R2) guidance3 introduced new concepts linked to an evolution of the traditional Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) from an interval safety report to a cumulative benefit-risk report. It changed the focus from individual case safety reports to aggregate data evaluation. In addition, the broadened scope increased the need for integrating information within the report.\n\nFootnote 3: The ICH E2C(R2) guidance is available on the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThe benefits of harmonizing technical requirements can only be achieved if the guidance is implemented and interpreted in a consistent way across the ICH regions. In November 2012, the ICH Steering Committee endorsed the establishment of an Implementation Working Group (IWG) on E2C(R2) to assist with the implementation of the guidance. The ICH E2C(R2) IWG has prepared this question and answer (Q&A) document to support implementation of the guidance in practice. The Q&A document is intended to facilitate practical implementation of the PBRER, including points to consider in addressing some of the more novel aspects of the new periodic safety report.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 General Guidance (2)\n\nHow can a Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) manage the submission of PBRERs when the reporting interval is different across multiple countries or regions?\n\nIn situations where the MAH is preparing PBRERs on both a 6-month and an annual basis for different regulatory authorities, it is possible that a PBRER on a 6-month cycle could be submitted as an up-to-date PBRER containing 12-month interval data (to fulfill the second 6-month interval of an annual cycle) (see Figure 2 below from the E2C(R2) guidance). The same may be true if a product is on a 6-month cycle in one region and a 3-year cycle in another region. However, the MAH should always discuss the acceptability of this approach with the relevant regulatory authority or authorities, noting that this approach is not an attempt to amend local reporting periodicity, but rather an opportunity to use the 12-month document to fulfill the shorter reporting period requirement.\n\nCan Summary Bridging Reports and Addendum Reports still be submitted?\n\nSummary Bridging Reports and Addendum Reports should no longer be submitted when following ICH E2C(R2). Independent of the time interval covered by the report, each PBRER should stand alone and reflect new and cumulative information currently available to the MAH.\n\nWhere in the PBRER can we present information on off-label use of the product?\n\nThe PBRER should report the evaluation of safety information based on all uses of the medicinal product, including uses outside the terms of the reference product information (more commonly known as off-label use). Although the benefit-risk evaluation should be conducted across approved indications, it is critical that the risk\n\nFigure 1: Submission of 6-Month and Annual PBRERsassessment take into account all uses of the product.\n\nSection I.C (1.3) of the E2C(R2) guidance (Scope of the PBRER) indicates that knowledge of a medicinal product's safety that is derived from data associated with uses other than the approved indication(s) should be reflected in the discussion of risk evaluation when it is available, relevant, and appropriate. Examples of potential sources of information on use outside the approved indication include, but are not limited to, spontaneous adverse event reports, investigator-initiated clinical trials, drug utilization data/studies, and published literature.\n\nSpecific information relating to off-label use can be included in the following sections of the PBRER:\n\nSection III.E.2 (3.5.2) (Cumulative and Interval Patient Exposure from Marketing Experience), paragraph c (Other post-approval use) The MAH should provide a brief description of patterns of use considered relevant for interpretation of safety data. This can include information on off-label use, including whether or not such use is supported by clinical guidelines, clinical trial evidence, or an absence of approved alternative treatments. For purposes of identifying patterns of use outside the terms of the reference product information, the MAH should use the appropriate sections (e.g., approved indication(s), contraindication(s)) of the reference product information that was in effect at the Data Lock Point (DLP) of the PBRER. See question 6.1of this Q&A document for points to consider in selecting the reference product information document.\n\nSections III.O (3.15) (Overview of Signals: New, Ongoing, or Closed) and III.P (3.16) (Signal and Risk Evaluation) The MAH should include in these sections the signals and risks arising from all uses of the product.\n\nSection III.R.2 (3.18.2) (Benefit-Risk Analysis Evaluation) Although the evaluation of benefit should be limited to approved use (see section III.Q (3.17) of the E2C(R2) guidance), the overall benefit-risk evaluation should take into account the risks associated with all uses of the product.\n\nWhat information sources could be used in preparing a PBRER?\n\nThe MAH should prepare the PBRER on the active substance(s) using data that the MAH might reasonably have access to and that are relevant to the evaluation of the safety or benefit-risk profile. Compared to the product for which the MAH is the innovator, there may be less information available to the MAH on a generic product. For example, only a published report may be accessible for a clinical trial not sponsored by the MAH. The MAH can consider providing as an appendix to the report a list of the information sources used to prepare the PBRER (see Appendix E of the E2C(R2) guidance).\n\nIII Modular Format (3)\n\nThe modular format of the PBRER facilitates using information from other regulatory documents. How can information be reused when the other documents do not share the same DLP?\n\nIf the regulatory documents are written at different times, it may not always be possible to reuse sections, because the information may change from one period to another. For example, this can occur when the PBRER is on a 6-month cycle and the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) is on an annual cycle. Some of the information from the 6-month PBRER could be used as a basis for populating some of the sections covering interval information in the annual DSUR. Appendix D of the E2C(R2) guidance lists the PBRER sections that can be shared with other regulatory documents.\n\nWhat practical points should the MAH consider to coordinate preparing DSURs and PBRERs?\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report \u2013 Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7721788883209229", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARMONISATION OF TECHNICAL REQUIREMIENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE\n\nICH HARMONISED TRIPARTITE GUIDELINE\n\nPeriodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER)\n\nE2C(R2)\n\nCurrent Step 4 version\n\ndated 17 December 2012\n\nThis Guideline has been developed by the appropriate ICH Expert Working Group and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH Process.

At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n\nSince that time, the pharmacovigilance environment has evolved, prompting reassessment of the role of the PSUR in the spectrum of safety documents submitted to regulatory authorities. This reassessment highlighted several factors that led to consensus for revision and refocus of the Guideline, to enhance its usefulness in light of advances in the field:\n\nSignificant progress in the technology and science of pharmacovigilance, including electronic submission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) to regulatory authorities, automated data mining techniques, and more attention to benefit-risk evaluation;\n\nGreater emphasis on proactive and documented risk management planning;\n\nIncreasing recognition that meaningful evaluation of important new risk information should be undertaken in the context of a medicinal product's benefits; and\n\nOverlap in the content of ICH Guidelines related to pharmacovigilance documentation.\n\nAs noted above, the primary objective of the PSUR was to provide a comprehensive picture of the safety of approved medicinal products. With recognition that the assessment of the risk of a medicinal product is most meaningful when considered in light of its benefits, the proposed report would provide greater emphasis on benefit than the PSUR, particularly when risk estimates change importantly. In such cases there will need to be an overall explicit evaluation of benefit-risk. Consequently the name of the proposed report is the \"Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report\" (PBRER). The PBRER would also provide greater emphasis on the cumulative knowledge regarding a medicinal product, while retaining a focus on new information.\n\nA formal evaluation of benefit is a new feature of the PBRER; however, it is recognised that a concise discussion of benefit will usually be sufficient, unless the safety or benefit-risk profile has changed significantly during the reporting interval. Thus, the level of detail provided in certain sections of the PBRER (e.g., evaluation of safety and efficacy data, evaluation of safety signals,* and benefit-risk evaluation) should be proportional to the medicinal product's known or emerging important risks and to evidence of emerging important benefits.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.052919387817383"], "From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: #156\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nComparability Protocols -\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and\n\nControls Information\n\nfor New Animal Drugs\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance at any time.

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7340348958969116", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: See 21 CFR 201.57(c)(15) and the guidance for industry Clinical Studies Section of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products \u2014 Content and Format (January 2006).\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 201.57(c)(2)(iv).\n\nAppendix\n\nThe following are general comments regarding the in vitro drug-release method development, acceptance criteria, and data submission that applicants should provide in new drug applications.\n\n1. In Vitro Drug-Release Method Development Report\n\nProvide a detailed description of the in vitro drug-release method being proposed to evaluate the drug product. Provide data to support that the selected in vitro drug-release method development parameters are the most appropriate for the proposed in vitro drug-release method (e.g., testing apparatus, dialysis chamber, in vitro release medium conditions, temperature). An accelerated drug-release method can be developed for quality control purposes. The testing conditions used for each test should be clearly specified. The release profile should demonstrate complete drug release or a plateau (i.e., no increase over three consecutive time points). We recommend the use of at least six samples per testing variable during method development.\n\nProvide complete in vitro drug-release profile data (individual, mean, standard deviation). The data should be reported as the cumulative percentage of drug released with time (the percentage is based on the drug product's proposed labeling claim at different time points).\n\nSubmit data to support the discriminating ability of the selected in vitro drug-release method. In general, the testing should compare the in vitro drug-release profiles of the target drug product and proposed drug products that are intentionally manufactured with meaningful variations for the most relevant critical material attributes and process parameters (i.e., plus or minus 10 to 20 percent change to the specification ranges of these variables).\n\nProvide supportive validation data for the in vitro drug-release method (i.e., method robustness, etc.) and analytical method (e.g., precision, accuracy, linearity, stability).\n\nProvide a list of critical material attributes and critical process parameters affecting in vitro drug release.\n\n2. In Vitro Drug-Release Acceptance Criteria\n\nThe complete in vitro drug-release profile data (e.g., 0.5, 1, and 6 hours, then 1, 2, 4, and 6 days, etc., n = 12) from clinical and registration/stability batches should be used for setting the in vitro drug-release acceptance criteria. Adequately validated and fully documented analytical methods should be used. FDA recommends a minimum of three time points to set the acceptance criteria (i.e., sampling time points and acceptance limits) for extended drug-release products from the lots used in the clinical trials and primary stability batches. These time points should cover the early, middle, and late stages of the drug-release profile. The last time point should be where at least 80 percent of the drug product is released. If the maximum amount released is less than 80 percent, the last time point should be the time when the plateau of the drug-release profile hasbeen reached. In general, the selection of the drug-release acceptance criteria ranges is based on mean target value plus or minus 10 percent and greater than 80 percent for the last sampling time point. Wider criteria ranges may be acceptable if they are supported by an approved in vitro-in vivo correlation or physiologically based pharmacokinetic model.\n\n3 Data Submission\n\nThe complete in vitro drug-release profile data for the clinical and stability batches of the drug product should be presented in tabular and graphical formats. The tables and plots of mean and individual vessel data for the clinical and stability batches should include profile data at release (time-zero) and throughout the duration of stability testing under long-term storage conditions.\n--------------------\nContext title: Advanced Prostate Cancer- Developing Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogues Guidance for Industry Clinical:Medical\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.6280601024627686", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Section 2.3.P.4 Control of Excipients: If appropriate, references to Type IV master files with information about release-controlling excipients may be provided in the product quality section pertaining to excipient control.\n\nSection 2.3.P.5 Control of Drug Product: * The proposed drug release method * Appropriate validation for the drug release method * Information that describes the IVIVC/R associated with the proposed test method. * Product expiry; * Setting product specifications at product release(time = zero) and expiry; * Changes in specifications beyond the ranges supported by the product batches used during the safety and effectiveness trials.\n\nStability: Justification of the proposed stability specifications.\n\nX Glossary\n\nAUC: Area Under the _C_urve; the integral of the plasma concentration vs. time curve.\n\nBatch: A specific quantity of a drug or other material produced according to a single manufacturing order during the same cycle of manufacture and intended to have uniform character and quality, within specified limits as per 21 CFR 210.3(b)(2).\n\nC({}_{\\text{max}}): Maximum plasma concentration.\n\nCritical quality attributes (CQAs): A physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality.[1]\n\nDrug product: A finished dosage form containing a drug substance, usually, but not necessarily, in association with one or more other ingredients as per 21CFR 314.3(b).\n\nDrug Release Test: An in vitro assay that assesses the percentage of the full dose released from a modified-release parenteral product over time.

The level of documentation and known information is usually not the same as what is included in a single adequate and well-controlled study submitted to CVM with raw data. However, the assessment of how much a formulation and other critical quality attributes can deviate from the proposed/final formulation is generally the same regardless of the type of study (SRMA or single prospectively designed study). Footnote 29: Formulation changes to a drug product may occur over time and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine their potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. These principles are discussed in more detail in Guidance for Industry #83, \u201cChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA\u201d (May 2007). In some cases, studies will be necessary to establish the equivalence of different formulations (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, and/or clinical studies as appropriate).\n\nAs noted in section III.B.3. Critical Factors, literature using the proposed final formulation manufactured by or for the sponsor provides the best, most rigorous evaluation and the highest evidentiary weight. If a sufficient number of studies using an acceptable formulation are not available or a connection to information found in the CMC technical section cannot be made, the SR approach will be unlikely to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. Footnote 29: The sponsor should provide CVM with an assessment of the information, a meaningful evaluation of the new animal drug used in the publishedreport included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) and a justification that it is appropriate to use the data generated in the study along with other studies in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable). The decision about the value of the information from the published studies to the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) will be made with the collaboration of ONADE's Division of Manufacturing Technologies and the target animal review team.\n\nAdequate and well-controlled studies, including SRs, include the use of methods to assess the animal response to the use of the new animal drug that are well defined and reliable (21 CFR 514.117(b)(8)). Sponsors should consider whether there are a sufficient number of studies which report the appropriate endpoint(s) in a consistent manner which would allow for quantification of the effect of the new animal drug.\n\nProtocol considerations specific to effectiveness:\n\nReview question: The review question should closely match the objectives of the study and follow the format described in section III.B.3.b.i. Developing the Review Question of this guidance. In general, effectiveness study review questions follow the format: \"Evaluation of the effectiveness of [drug product and dose if appropriate] for [indication] as compared to [control type] in [species/class/animal age as appropriate].\"\n\nDefinition of the control: Please refer to section III.B.3.b.ii. Writing the protocol (Control Type).\n\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Examples of screening inclusion/exclusion criteria which may be assessed based on the title, abstract, and/or key words include:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nScreening Inclusion & Screening Exclusion \\ \\hline Study types: Complete reports (published or unpublished) on & Incomplete reports (abstracts and \\ randomized controlled trials (RCTs), & reviews), or insufficient information \\ cluster RCTs, and select non- & to assess these criteria (incomplete \\ randomized controlled studies & reports may not be excluded if full \\  & information could be obtained from \\  & the study investigator) \\ \\hline Study includes intended target animal & Study includes animals that are not \\ species and class & representative of the target animal \\  & species and class \\ \\hline Use of the drug product of interest (at & Drug product of interest not a part \\ screening phase, identification of & of the study \\ active ingredient may be sufficient) & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExamples of eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria based on assessment of the full text of the publication:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nEligibility Inclusion & Eligibility Exclusion \\ \\hline Drug product as defined in the protocol & Study does not include drug product \\  & as defined in protocol, or \\  & publication does not provide \\  & sufficient information to identify \\  & the drug product (unable to confirm \\  & formulation used in the study) \\ \\hline Study uses intended label dosage (dose,  frequency, and route of administration) & Dosage used in study inconsistent \\  & with the intended label dosage \\ \\hline Study includes the use of acceptable & Study includes the use of \\   concurrent therapies (e.g., the studies & concurrent therapy that may \\   may employ concurrent therapies per & confound the effectiveness \\   the current standards of care; however, & evaluation \\   these considerations should be & \\   described clearly within the protocol.) & \\ \\hline Study designed to evaluate endpoint(s) & Study not designed to evaluate \\   of interest & endpoint(s) of interest \\ \\hline Screening and eligibility inclusion and exclusion criteria should only evaluate & whether the measurement of an effectiveness outcome is present and should \\   not specify a particular effectiveness outcome for inclusion in the & \\   effectiveness database. For example, studies that do not demonstrate the & \\   desired level of effect or that report a poor effectiveness outcome should not & \\   be excluded from the effectiveness database. & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n* Basis of study conclusion: The protocol should clearly state the criteria on which study conclusions will be based. The study objectives and the statistical analysis results should be considered when defining the criteria. For example, a threshold for an effect size or a threshold for the limits of a confidence interval for the effect size could be used as criterion. In addition, the study conclusion should also consider bias investigation results.\n\n4 Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness\n\nSection 571 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360ccc) provides for a qualified approval pathway, open only to certain qualifying new animal drug products based on indication and type, called conditional approval. Conditional approval allows a sponsor to legally market a new animal drug after demonstrating the drug is safe and manufactured in accordance with the full approval standards, and that there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. To obtain conditional approval, all technical sections must be complete except the effectiveness technical section, which isreplaced with RXE. The sponsor can market the conditionally approved new animal drug product for up to 5 years while gathering the remaining data required to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. The pathway requires annual renewal of the conditional approval to determine whether the sponsor is making sufficient progress toward meeting the effectiveness standard for full approval. Literature may be used as one of the pathways to support RXE. Screening and eligibility criteria for publications that may be used to support RXE are generally the same as for substantial evidence of effectiveness; however, the overall body of evidence may be smaller and information gaps may still be present. Full scoping or systematic literature reviews are not routinely expected but may be appropriate.\n\nAppendix E Target Animal Safety\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nSection 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval, including target animal safety. See FD&C Act section 512(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D)).\n\nLiterature, including narrative reviews, SR, and meta-analysis, may be acceptable to fulfill all or part of the requirements for target animal safety for a new animal drug application or an application for conditional approval (see FD&C Act section 571(a)(2)(B)). Literature is most commonly used to evaluate the extent and quality of information available on the safety of a new animal drug for the proposed indication or proposed conditions of use, support the design of the target animal safety evaluation, and/or provide information to predict potential adverse effects in the target species. In some cases, literature may provide all or a portion of the information required to demonstrate whether a new animal drug is safe for the intended use and conditions of use.\n\nCVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the development plan to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of using literature to fulfill some or all of the target animal safety requirements.\n\nAppendix B Preliminary Information\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.4327659606933594", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: iii. Writing the protocol:\n\nAll regulatory SRs should be conducted in accordance with a protocol.\n\nProtocol review by CVM is not required, but it is strongly recommended for any study intended to support an application. Protocol concurrence helps to prevent expenditure of resources on a study that CVM is less likely to accept. Sponsors are encouraged to discuss specific questions about protocol design in early communications with CVM's Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (ONADE).\n\nAt a minimum, the protocol should include the following components:\n\nStudy objective:\n\nThe protocol should include a clear statement of the study objectives (e.g., the objective of the study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific formulation of drug, given at a defined dosage, for specific indications (and conditions of use) in specific species/classes). The objectives of the study are generally synonymous with the review question.\n\nStandard of conduct for SRs:\n\nThe SR should be conducted in accordance with an appropriate standard of conduct. Systematic reviews are, by nature, retrospective, and do not meet the definition of either a clinical study or nonclinical laboratory study. Elements of standards of conduct that apply to systematic reviews include: protocol development; organizational structure to ensure appropriate control of the study (e.g., investigator responsibilities, oversight (monitoring), quality assurance, quality control, and qualifications of personnel); procedures to ensure appropriate study documentation and archiving; and the documentation of the study conduct and results in a final study report. Standard expectations for data quality 9attributable, legible, contemporaneously recorded, original or a true copy, and accurate (ALCOA)) and integrity (credible, consistent, corroborative (CCC)) apply.\n\nControl type:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe systematic review protocol should include a design which permits a valid comparison to an appropriate control group and should evaluate the drug in the appropriate study population (species/class(es)). It should use methods to minimize bias on the part of observers and analysts of the data that are adequate to prevent undue influences on the results and interpretation of the study data. The systematic review should include procedures to identify, evaluate, and minimize bias both within an individual study and across the studies included in the systematic review.\n\nThe type of control chosen should appropriately reflect the review question and endpoints of interest and should adequately characterize the effect and variability in outcome in the population of interest in the absence of the new animal drug. Generally speaking, there are four types of control groups: untreated concurrent control, placebo control, active controls, or historical controls (21 CFR 514.117(b)(4) and the 2015 Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual).\n\nIn general, the most suitable control group data source is one that can be generated from the eligible studies included in the SR that also had treatment groups included in the meta-analysis (concurrent control). However, even if the studies selected for the SR are randomized/controlled studies, there may not be a sufficient number of included studies with the selected control group (negative control vs. active, etc.). In many cases, a mixture of study designs may be available for potential inclusion in the SR, including, in some cases, studies which do not have a concurrent control group. Studies that do not have the control group of interest should not be automatically excluded from the SR. In situations where not all eligible studies include the control group of interest, mathematical procedures may be employed to adjust the estimated control group effect size to account for unknown extraneous influences (Hunter, Jensen, and Rodgers 2014).20\n\nFootnote 20: Hunter, J.E., J.L. Jensen, and R. Rodgers. 2014. \u201cThe control group and meta-analysis.\u201d Journal of Methods and Measurements in the Social Sciences no. 5 (1):3-21.\n\nIf a control group cannot be compiled from the studies that also had treatment groups included in the meta-analysis, use of a historical control group may be appropriate for the regulatory decision in certain situations (e.g., studies in which the effect of the new animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity) (see 21 CFR 514.117(b)(4)(iv)).\n\n4.2.3 Literature search strategy:\n\nA literature search strategy should be described which has a high likelihood that articles relevant to the review question will be retrieved.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe protocol should include a description of the databases, search terms (keywords and Boolean operators), date and language restrictions, plans for hand-searching of certain publications (e.g., review articles) or personal contact of scientists, and a search of other sources of information such as conference proceedings, unpublished studies, theses, or dissertations.\n\nSponsors should include relevant pilot work or otherwise non-publicly available, proprietary studies in the regulatory SR. By not restricting the studies to those that are published, publication bias may be reduced.\n\nThe methodology of indexing within a database (e.g., the use of controlled vocabulary) should be considered in the design of the search strategy. As with scoping reviews, the inclusion of an information specialist in the design and implementation of the literature search is recommended. Overall, the description should be sufficient to allow the search to be repeated with the same results.\n\n4.2.3 Study selection (screening and eligibility assessment):\n\nA highly sensitive literature search may retrieve many studies which are not relevant to the SR. Therefore, the protocol should describe methods for choosing the studies including first screening the full list of literature (based on title, abstract, and keywords) and then reviewing full reports to determine the eligibility for inclusion in the SR. Appropriately designed screening inclusion and exclusion criteria are important for identifying literature that will contribute to a comprehensive database in an efficient manner without excluding relevant literature. The criteria should ensure the selection of studies which are designed to answer the review question for the particular drug formulation for the indication and conditions of use. The protocol should describe the use of more than one reviewer for conducting the screening and eligibility assessments to minimize the risk of error and/or bias. In addition, the protocol should describe the process for resolving disagreements between reviewers, if they occur (e.g., use of a third independent reviewer). The final study report should describe the numbers of reports that were screened, as well as the number that passed screening and eligibility phases and were ultimately included in the qualitative or quantitative (meta-analysis) assessment.\n\nExamples of screening criteria:\n\nType of study: The types of studies utilized for the review will depend on the objectives of the study. Examples include prospective randomized studies, cluster randomized control trials (RCTs), some types of non-randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and case control studies. Review articles are generally excluded but are used for hand-searching of additional references.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStudy animals: The studies are usually limited to the species (and class if necessary) for which the new animal drug is intended.\n\nTreatment: In the screening phase, criteria are usually specific only to the active ingredient because the title, abstract, and/or key words do not always provide enough information to identify specific drug products. At this phase, citations that are specific to alternate dosage forms or formulations which would not be used in the SR are excluded.\n\nOutcome measure: Whether or not a study includes a particular outcome measure is not always evident from the title, abstract, or keywords. Broad criteria are necessary to avoid excluding relevant studies. For example, if the outcome of interest is specific to a disease, it would be appropriate to include citations for studies in which a drug is used for the treatment of that disease. The evaluation of the full text of the study report may be necessary to determine if the outcomes of interest were used in the study.\n\nFor those citations with insufficient information to enable a screening evaluation using the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the protocol should allow for an evaluation of the full report in the eligibility phase of the study. For example, some citations (particularly those in foreign languages and/or without abstracts) do not have a sufficiently detailed title to allow for an appropriate screening assessment. If, after reviewing the full text, the reviewer determines that the report does not meet the screening criteria, it should be included in the counts of reports that did not pass the screening phase of the SR.\n\nGenerally, the eligibility criteria build upon screening criteria and require more specific information that is found in the full text of the study report.\n\nExamples of eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria:\n\nTreatment: For many SRs, eligible studies include a specific drug product (including the intended formulation). Criteria should be established to allow for confirmation of formulation and other information as needed and consistent with the purpose of the SR.\n\nAnimal information: If certain animal characteristics (e.g., disease state) are critical to the objectives of the study, these should be defined in the eligibility criteria.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8170723915100098", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Was the specific proposed commercial formulation used in the literature?\n\nWere the lots used in the published study tested according to the proposed release testing and are the results of the release testing published or available for review?\n\nDoes the sponsor have experience with manufacturing the product under current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) (FD&C Act section 501(a)(2)(B)) conditions and can historical data be provided to support the proposed release and stability specifications?\n\nIf a direct connection cannot be made between the proposed commercial formulation and the published literature (e.g., a different drug product was used in the studies described in the published literature), the sponsor should consider:\n\nIf the literature indicates that a specific safety (e.g., byproduct of manufacturingprocess or stability that could lead to toxicity) or effectiveness (e.g., narrow therapeutic range) issue exists that should be controlled in the manufacturing process.\n\nIf bridging studies (e.g., bioequivalence) have been performed to demonstrate the relevance of the information in the literature to the proposed drug product.\n\nDepending on the complexity of the drug product and the manufacturing process, if general specifications (e.g., assay 90-110 percent), based on appropriate VICH or CVM guidance documents or United States Pharmacopeia (USP) chapters or monographs, can be utilized.\n\nIf there are any critical quality attributes of the drug product where a link to clinical safety and effectiveness data is needed (e.g., release characteristics, new dosage form, bioassay, viability), reference to published scientific literature alone may not be sufficient to support the approval of the new animal drug product.\n\n4 Effectiveness\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nLiterature may be used to fulfill all or part of the requirements for the effectiveness technical section for new animal drug product approvals or the reasonable expectation of effectiveness (RXE) technical section for conditional new animal drug product approvals. For example, SRs and meta-analyses may provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for either all or a portion of the indication. Individual literature reports may provide information to satisfy a particular data gap, lead to the identification of a data gap, or satisfy RXE.\n\nThe degree of support that literature submissions may provide toward fulfilling requirements for substantial evidence of effectiveness or reasonable expectation of effectiveness cannot fully be determined until after review of the submission and review of other technical information such as chemistry and pharmacokinetic data. CVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the approval process to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of a path forward.\n\n2. Dosage Characterization\n\nDosage characterization is the justification of the dosage (dose or dose range, dosing frequency, and the dosing duration) and a characterization of the critical aspects of the dose-response relationship related to each intended use and associated conditions of use. Dosage characterization is part of the effectiveness technical section of an INAD file and may be derived from dose titration studies, pilot studies, foreign studies, scientific literature, or other sources. Scientific literature, including individual or multiple sources, may be used to support a portion or all of the justification of the dosage and may significantly assist protocol development. For example, literature may provide information integral for the selection of optimal study time points or specify study design parameters for protocols for novel drugs and drugs with modified-release characteristics or extended duration of action. In general, sufficient scientific literature to reasonably support the basis for the dose characterization is acceptable; for example, a narrative review. Full scoping or systematic literature reviews are not routinely expected. If the use of literature to fulfill a portion or all other technical sections is contemplated, any literature used to characterize the dosage should be identified and evaluated in an independent manner to avoid biasing a future systematic review.\n\n3 Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness\n\nRegulatory standards: Effectiveness must be demonstrated by substantial evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies (FD&C Act sections 512(d)(1)(E) and (d)(3); 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8)(ii); 21 CFR 514.4(a); and 21 CFR 514.117). Substantial evidence is defined in 21 CFR 514.4(a) as \"evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies...on the basis of which it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the new animal drug involved that the new animal drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof. Substantial evidence shall include such adequate and well-controlled studies that are, as a matter of sound scientific judgment, necessary to establish that a new animal drug will have its intended effect.\" An SR intended to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a new animal drug for an original or supplemental NADA must be adequate and well-controlled (21 CFR 514.4(a)). The protocol for an SR should provide details relative to the study design, conduct, and analysis in accordance with the characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study (21 CFR 514.117(a)-(b)). When using an SR to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness, the review objective is generally the same as a traditional clinical study (e.g., the objective of the study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific formulation of drug, given at a specific dosage, for specific indications (and conditions of use) in specific species/classes). Things to consider when developing a proposal for an SR to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness:\n\nThe regulations (21 CFR 514.4) require a demonstration of substantial evidence of effectiveness for the new animal drug, and 21 CFR 514.117(b)(3) requires that adequate and well-controlled studies be conducted with \"...a new animal drug that is produced in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices, which include, but are not necessarily limited to, the manufacture, processing, packaging, holding, and labeling of the new animal drug such that the critical characteristics of\nidentity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form of the new animal drug are known, recorded, and reproducible, to permit meaningful evaluations of and comparisons with other studies conducted with the new animal drug\" [emphasis added]. Therefore, for SRs, as is the case for other types of adequate and well-controlled studies, critical factors in the study design are the identity, strength, quality, purity, physical form, and critical quality attributes28 of the new animal drug product used in the study. All individual studies included in the SR should have sufficient detail to confirm the identity of the drug product. In some cases, author contact may facilitate the retrieval of additional product specific information (lot numbers, batch numbers, certificates of analysis) useful for the SR and confirmation of appropriate manufacturing practices. Footnote 28: ICH Q8(R2), \u201cPharmaceutical Development\u201d (November 2009).\n\nGenerally, if studies using a proposed new animal drug product's final formulation are not available for inclusion in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable), this will limit the applicability of the information.29 The acceptability of published studies will depend on the complexity of the formulation, how much control the sponsor had over the manufacturing process, etc. CVM will evaluate the drug product used in each published study included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) using information on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form. The level of documentation and known information is usually not the same as what is included in a single adequate and well-controlled study submitted to CVM with raw data. However, the assessment of how much a formulation and other critical quality attributes can deviate from the proposed/final formulation is generally the same regardless of the type of study (SRMA or single prospectively designed study). Footnote 29: Formulation changes to a drug product may occur over time and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine their potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. These principles are discussed in more detail in Guidance for Industry #83, \u201cChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA\u201d (May 2007). In some cases, studies will be necessary to establish the equivalence of different formulations (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, and/or clinical studies as appropriate).\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.244355201721191"], "Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor's obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency's view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject's decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB's primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor's need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n\"A sponsor's preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval.\" The effect of the IRB's NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor's wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency's policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.2373576164245605", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: IV IRB Records\n\n31. Are annual IRB reviews required when all studies are reviewed by the IRB each quarter?\n\nThe IRB records for each study's initial and continuing review should note the frequency (not to exceed one year) for the next continuing review in either months or other conditions, such as after a particular number of subjects are enrolled.\n\nAn IRB may decide, to review all studies on a quarterly basis. If every quarterly report contains sufficient information for an adequate continuing review and is reviewed by the IRB under procedures that meet FDA requirements for continuing review, FDA would not require an additional \"annual\" review.\n\n21 CFR 56.115(a)(1) requires that the IRB maintain copies of \"research proposals reviewed.\" Is the \"research proposal\" the same as the formal study protocol that the investigator receives from the sponsor of the research?\n\nYes. The IRB should receive and review all research activities [21 CFR 56.109(a)]. The documents reviewed should include the complete documents received from the clinical investigator, such as the protocol, the investigator's brochure, a sample consent document and any advertising intended to be seen or heard by prospective study subjects. Some IRBs also require the investigator to submit an institutionally-developed protocol summary form. A copy of all documentation reviewed is to be maintained for at least three years after completion of the research at that institution [21 CFR 56.115(b)]. However, when the IRB makes changes, such as in the wording of the informed consent document, only the finally approved copy needs to be retained in the IRB records.\n\n33. What IRB records are required for studies that are approved but never started?\n\nWhen an IRB approves a study, continuing review should be performed at least annually. All of the records listed in 21 CFR 56.115(a)(1) - (4) are required to be maintained. The clock starts on the date of approval, whether or not subjects have been enrolled. Written progress reports should be received from the clinical investigator for all studies that are in approved status prior to the date of expiration of IRB approval. If subjects were never enrolled, the clinical investigator's progress report would be brief. Such studies may receive continuing IRB review using expedited procedures. If the study is finally canceled without subject enrollment, records should be maintained for at least three years after cancellation [21 CFR 56.115(b)].\n\nV Informed Consent Process\n\nNo. The consent document is a written summary of the information that should be provided to the subject. Many clinical investigators use the consent document as a guide for the verbal explanation of the study. The subject's signature provides documentation of agreement to participate in a study, but is only one part of the consent process. The entire informed consent process involves giving a subject adequate information concerning the study, providing adequate opportunity for the subject to consider all options, responding to the subject's questions, ensuring that the subject has comprehended this information, obtaining the subject's voluntary agreement to participate and, continuing to provide information as the subject or situation requires. To be effective, the process should provide ample opportunity for the investigator and the subject to exchange information and ask questions.\n\n35. May informed consent be obtained by telephone from a legally authorized representative?\n\nA verbal approval does not satisfy the 21 CFR 56.109(c) requirement for a signed consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(a). However, it is acceptable to send the informed consent document to the legally authorized representative (LAR) by facsimile and conduct the consent interview by telephone when the LAR can read the consent as it is discussed. If the LAR agrees, he/she can sign the consent and return the signed document to the clinical investigator by facsimile.\n\n21 CFR 50.27(a) requires that a copy of the consent document be given to the person signing the form. Does this copy have to be a photocopy of the form with the subject's signature affixed?\n\nNo. The regulation does not require the copy of the form given to the subject to be a copy of the document with the subject's signature, although this is encouraged. It must, however, be a copy of the IRB approved document that was given to the subject to obtain consent [21 CFR 50.27(a) or 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)]. One purpose of providing the person signing the form with a copy of the consent document is to allow the subject to review the information with others, both before and after making a decision to participate in the study, as well as providing a continuing reference for items such as scheduling of procedures and emergency contacts.\n\nIf an IRB uses a standard \"fill-in-the-blank\" consent format, does the IRB need to review the filled out form for each study?\n\nYes. A fill-in-the-blank format provides only some standard wording and a framework for organizing the relevant study information. The IRB should review a completed sample form, individualized for each study, to ensure that the consent document, in its entirety, contains all the information required by 21 CFR 50.25 in language the subject can understand. The completed sample form should be typed to enhance its readability by the subjects. The form finally approved by the IRB should be an exact copy of the form that will be presented to the research subjects. The IRB should also review the \"process\" for conducting the consent interviews, i.e., the circumstances under which consent will be obtained, who will obtain consent, and so forth.\n\nThe informed consent regulations [21 CFR 50.25 (a)(5)] require the consent document to include a statement that notes the possibility that FDA may inspect the records. Is this statement a waiver of the subject's legal right to privacy? No. FDA does not require any subject to \"waive\" a legal right. Rather, FDA requires that subjects be informed that complete privacy does not apply in the context of research involving FDA regulated products. Under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA may inspect and copy clinical records to verify information submitted by a sponsor. FDA generally will not copy a subject's name during the inspection unless a more detailed study of the case is required or there is reason to believe that the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. The consent document should not state or imply that FDA needs clearance or permission from the clinical investigator, the subject or the IRB for such access. When clinical investigators conduct studies for submission to FDA, they agree to allow FDA access to the study records, as outlined in 21 CFR 312.68 and 812.145. Informed consent documents should make it clear that, by participating in research, the subject's records automatically become part of the research database. Subjects do not have the option to keep their records from being audited/reviewed by FDA. When an individually identifiable medical record (usually kept by the clinical investigator, not by the IRB) is copied and reviewed by the Agency, proper confidentiality procedures are followed within FDA. Consistent with laws relating to public disclosure of information and the law enforcement responsibilities of the Agency, however, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.\n\nWho should be present when the informed consent interview is conducted? FDA does not require a third person to witness the consent interview unless the subject or representative is not given the opportunity to read the consent document before it is signed, see 21 CFR 50.27(b). The person who conducts the consent interview should be knowledgeable about the study and able to answer questions. FDA does not specify who this individual should be. Some sponsors and some IRBs require the clinical investigator to personally conduct the consent interview. However, if someone other than the clinical investigator conducts the interview and obtains consent, this responsibility should be formally delegated by the clinical investigator and the person so delegated should have received appropriate training to perform this activity.\n\nHow do you obtain informed consent from someone who speaks and understands English but cannot read? Illiterate persons who understand English may have the consent read to them and \"make their mark,\" if appropriate under applicable state law. The 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) requirements for signature of a witness to the consent process and signature of the person conducting consent interview must be followed, if a \"short form\" is used. Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do.\n\nThe IRB should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to coercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated, see 21 CFR 56.111(b).\n\n41. Must a witness observe the entire consent interview or only the signature of the subject?\n\nFDA does not require the signature of a witness when the subject reads and is capable of understanding the consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(b)(1). The intended purpose is to have the witness present during the entire consent interview and to attest to the accuracy of the presentation and the apparent understanding of the subject. If the intent of the regulation were only to attest to the validity of the subject's signature, witnessing would also be required when the subject reads the consent.\n\n42. Should the sponsor prepare a model informed consent document?\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.9271459579467773", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors must also report such information to FDA. Sponsors of drug/biologic studies are required under 21 CFR 312.31(a)(2) to report to FDA any information regarding the discontinuation of a clinical investigation in an information amendment to the Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Sponsors of device studies are required under 21 CFR 812.150(b)(2) to notify FDA and all reviewing IRBs and participating investigators of any withdrawal of IRB approval of an investigation or a part of an investigation within 5 working days after receipt of the withdrawal.\n\n(5) Confirming or establishing the date for the next continuing review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB performs a review at the time of clinical investigation transfer (whether an initial or a continuing review), it may choose to maintain the anniversary date of approval established by the original IRB or decide to establish a new anniversary date. If the receiving IRB decides to establish a new anniversary date, the new date must be within one year of the receiving IRB's review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB does not conduct a review of the clinical investigation at the time of transfer, the date of clinical investigation approval by the original IRB is presumed to remain in effect for the full approval period established at the time of the most recent review by the original IRB. For example, if the original IRB initially approved the clinical investigation for one year effective July 1, 2011, and the clinical investigation is transferred to a new IRB effective October 1, 2011, the expiration date of IRB approval would continue to be July 1, 2012, unless or until the receiving IRB establishes a new expiration date. Note that review in accordance with a newly established expiration date would nonetheless need to be conducted prior to the original July 1, 2012 expiration date.\n\n(6) Determining whether the consent form needs to be revised.\n\nThe informed consent document is required to contain \"[a]n explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject.\"35 Therefore, when a change in IRB oversight results in changes in the contact information regarding subject rights and/or whom to contact in the event of research-related injury, the new contact information must be provided to subjects. For subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active), this may be accomplished in a number of ways, including sending a letter providing the relevant contact information.36 For new subjects, the informed consent, assent, and/or parental permission form must be revised to reflect the new contact information.37 The clinical investigator should promptly notify the IRB of any such administrative changes to the consent form.\n\nFootnote 36: FDA does not require subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active) to be re-consented for such minor changes; however, IRBs may choose to do so.\n\nFootnote 37: 21 CFR 50.25(a)(7).\n\nOther changes to the consent form may also be necessary, for example, if the receiving IRB requires modifications to the consent form at the site(s) under its jurisdiction as a condition of approval (e.g., changes in template language, changes in risks, etc.).38 Depending upon the types of changes needed, they may be conveyed to the clinical investigator and sponsor as required modifications to secure IRB approval for the clinical investigation at that site or sites and may require reporting to FDA.39\n\nFootnote 38: 21 CFR 56.109(a) and (b).\n\nFootnote 39: 39 See, e.g., 21 CFR 56.109(a), 21 CFR 312.31, and 21 CFR 812.35.\n\nFootnote 40: 21 CFR 312.31(a).\n\n(7) Notifying the key parties.\n\nAs discussed above, all key parties involved in the transfer of oversight (e.g., clinical investigator, sponsor, and original and receiving IRBs) should discuss their respective responsibilities before implementing the transfer. In addition, the sponsor should notify pertinent entities involved in the clinical investigation (e.g., institutional members, Data Safety Monitoring Board, CRO), as and when appropriate. After IRB transfer of oversight for the clinical investigation is complete, the sponsor must update the associated IND40 or IDE41 with the name and contact information of the receiving IRB and should include the effective date of transfer.\n\nFootnote 41: 21 CFR 812.35(a)(4).\n\nFor studies for which the original IRB acts as a central IRB, those local institutions/IRBs that have written agreements with the original IRB (to transfer review responsibility to that original IRB) should be notified that responsibility for the study is now being transferred to a new central IRB (receiving IRB). We recommend that those local institutions/IRBs be given the option to enter into new written agreements with the receiving IRB or opt out of the central review arrangement if they do not believe central review by the receiving IRB is appropriate for their local institution (e.g., are concerned about the ability of the receiving IRB to adequately address local issues).42\n\nFootnote 42: For more information on the responsibilities of central IRBs and local institutions/IRBs with respect to central IRB review, see \u201cUsing a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,\u201d available at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127004.htm.\n\nAdditionally, when an IRB declines to accept oversight of a clinical investigation, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the appropriate party(ies) who initiated the transfer process (refer to page 3 for further information; parties responsible for initiating the transfer may not be those responsible for securing IRB review) to enable the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to make alternate arrangements for IRB review.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]\n\nthe reasons for the transfer and the risk posed by the study. In the case of a natural disaster, although the transfer may initially be thought to only be required for a short period of time, additional time may ultimately be needed before the original IRB is able to resume its oversight responsibilities. The original and receiving IRBs would need to ensure that study oversight does not lapse; adverse events are reported to the appropriate IRB, etc. during this interim period.\n\nAppendix B Transfer of a Clinical Investigation to a New Research Site Requiring IRB Review\n\nA sponsor may decide to transfer a clinical investigation to a different research site when, for instance, a clinical investigator relocates to that new site. Because the transfer involves changes to the research (i.e., conducting the research in a new location, consent form revisions, possible changes in key staff, etc.), the sponsor or investigator must submit these changes to the receiving IRB for review and approval, prior to implementing the changes.44 In many cases, these changes represent a \"minor change\" to the research, which the IRB may review under an expedited review procedure.45\n\nSuch a move to a new research site may or may not entail changing the IRB. If the reviewing IRB changes as a result, then the considerations described in Section III apply, except initial or continuing IRB review must be conducted (an IRB may not approve a change in research without first conducting an initial or continuing review).46\n\nFDA notes that, even if the IRB remains the same when a study is transferred to a new research site, IRB review/approval for the new research site is required because such a move is considered a change in previously approved research.47 Additionally, the sponsor must notify FDA of any change in research site, clinical investigator, and/or IRB. For drug or biologics studies, this notification can generally be accomplished through an IND protocol or information amendment, whereas for device studies it can generally be accomplished in an IDE annual report.48\n\nFootnote 44: 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4). For drug/biologic studies, clinical investigators are responsible for securing IRB approval under 21 CFR 312.66; for device studies, the sponsor is responsible under 21 CFR 812.35(a)(1) and (3).\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2).\n\nFootnote 46: 21 CFR 56.103(a), 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4), and 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2). There is an exception to this general requirement: changes necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects may be initiated without IRB review and approval, as described in 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: 21 Didd.\n\nFootnote 48: 21 CFR 312.30, 21 CFR 312.31, 21 CFR 812.35, and 21 CFR 812.150(b)(5). For a discussion of the types of changes in an IND study that require a new Form 1572, refer to Question 7 of FDA\u2019s Guidance \u201cFrequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572),\u201davailable at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm214282.pdf\n\nAppendix V Additional Questions about Transferring oversight of a Clinical Investigation\n\nOccasionally, during the course of its initial or continuing review of a transferred clinical investigation or at other times during oversight transfer, an original or receiving IRB may have questions that are not resolvable through communications with the sponsor or clinical investigator. In such situations, either IRB may contact FDA for additional guidance. Affected sponsors and clinical investigators may also contact FDA in these situations. Please use the following as an initial point of contact:\n\nBioresearch Monitoring Branch, Division of Inspections and Surveillance, Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality * Phone: (301) 827-6221 * Email: industry.biologics@fda.gov\n\nOffice of Scientific Investigations, Office of Compliance * Phone: (301) 796-3150 * Email: cder-osi@fda.hhs.gov\n\nDivision of Bioresearch Monitoring, Office of Compliance * Phone: (301) 796-5490 * Email: bimo@cdrh.fda.gov\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations When Transferring Clinical Investigation Oversight to Another IRB Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.8328146934509277", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: For multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n\nSponsor personnel (usually a field engineer) may be present during the procedure and/or follow-up visits for some medical device studies. These individuals may provide technical support and/or record study-related information for the test article. If sponsor personnel will be present during the procedure or follow-up, or if the activities of the sponsor personnel directly affect the subject, those activities should also be described in the informed consent form.70\n\nFootnote 70: See \u201cGuidance for Industry: Investigator Responsibilities \u2013 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigator-responsibilities-protecting-rights-safety-and-welfare-study-subjects.\n\nThe FDA\n\nFDA's regulations for drug (including biologic) and device investigations have different requirements for the submission of informed consent materials (see sections IV.D.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and IV.D.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices,\" for additional information). Sponsors are not required to submit informed consent materials to FDA for all clinical investigations (see, for example, 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) and (c)); however, FDA may require that they be submitted in some cases as discussed below.\n\nGenerally, when informed consent materials are submitted, FDA reviewers assess the adequacy of the consent form by considering its communication of reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject and other elements required by 21 CFR 50.25. In some situations, FDA may find a consent form to be misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete in a way that would make informed consent inadequate and noncompliant with 21 CFR part 50. In these cases, FDA may require that specific revisions be made to address the concern(s) before the clinical investigation can proceed (21 CFR 312.42 and 812.30).\n\nFDA's review of the consent form as part of an IND or IDE application submission does not substitute for the responsibility or authority of the IRB to review and approve the consent form and consent process as a condition for the clinical investigation to begin (21 CFR 56.103(a)). IRBs are responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the information in the consent form and may require modification as appropriate (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b)).\n\nBelow are specific areas FDA considers in its review of the consent form:\n\nvi.2.1 Investigational New Drugs and Biologics71\n\nFootnote 71: For the purposes of this document, unless otherwise specified, all references to \u201cdrugs\u201d or \u201cdrug products\u201d include human drug products and biological products that are also drugs.\n\nThe IND regulations (21 CFR part 312) do not specifically require submission to FDA of the consent form with the IND. However, if FDA determines that review of the consent form is necessary to make the determination of whether the clinical investigation may safely proceed, the Agency will request that the sponsor submit the consent form for review under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(11).\n\nAs a general matter, FDA will review the informed consent form for treatment INDs and treatment protocols (21 CFR part 312, subpart I) and INDs for studies conducted under the Exception From Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research (21 CFR 50.24) for consistency with 21 CFR 50.25 (see 21 CFR 50.24(a)(6)).\n\nFor other clinical investigations of drugs, FDA often considers the following factors in determining whether to require submission and review of the consent form:\n\nNonclinical studies submitted in support of the first administration of a drug in humans have identified an unusual toxicity.\n\nUnusual known toxicity is associated with the investigational drug, the drug class to which the drug belongs, or with a different drug with characteristics similar to those of the study drug.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:46]\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nThis section of the guidance document is intended to provide answers to frequently asked questions about FDA's regulations for the protection of human subjects. The numbers assigned to the questions are intended for ease of reference and do not represent the frequency with which these questions are asked.\n\niv.4.1 What are some considerations for enrolling a child?2 into a clinical investigation?\n\nFDA regulations provide additional safeguards for children enrolled in clinical investigations, as described in 21 CFR part 50, subpart D.73 If a child is to be enrolled in a clinical investigation, parental or guardian permission must be obtained in accordance with the requirements for informed consent in 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 50.55(e))74 and be documented in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (21 CFR 50.55(f)). When appropriate, the assent of the child also must be obtained (see 21 CFR 50.55(a)-(d)). As with informed consent for adult subjects, the exceptions to informed consent requirements described in section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\", apply to research involving children.\n\nFootnote 72: For purposes of 21 CFR part 50, the term children means \u201cpersons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted.\u201d See 21 CFR 50.3(o).\n\nFootnote 73: FDA promulgated 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, \u201cAdditional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations,\u201d as an interim rule in April 2001 (see 66 FR 20589, April 24, 2001; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-04-24/pdf/01-10008.pdf), and issued a final rule in February 2013 (see 78 FR 12937, February 26, 2013; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-02-26/pdf/2013-04387.pdf).\n\nThe IRB may determine that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical investigations involving no greater than minimal risk to children to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.51, or clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk to children but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects in accordance with 21 CFR 50.52 (21 CFR 50.55(e)(1)).\n\nFor clinical investigations to be conducted in accordance with either 21 CFR 50.53 or 21 CFR 50.54,75 where permission is to be obtained from parents, the permission of both parents is required unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child (21 CFR 50.55(e)(2)).76\n\nFootnote 76: For additional discussion on what is meant by \u201cnot reasonably available,\u201d see the Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) recommendations at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/attachment-d-november-13-2018/indes.html.\n\nThe general requirements for informed consent, found in 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27, apply to parental permission (21 CFR 50.55(e)-(f)). When obtaining parental permission, in the event the parents of a child do not understand English, the parental permission must be obtained and documented in language that is understandable to the parents (21 CFR 50.20). The child who will be participating in the research should not be used as an interpreter for the parent, even if the child is fluent in English and may be able to assent. Similarly, if child assent is required, the information given to the child should be in language that is understandable to the child.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.392594814300537", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ExpandedAccessCompassionateUse/uc m429610.htm.\n\nUnder individual patient expanded access INDs, the physician who submits an IND is considered a sponsor-investigator (as defined in SS 312.3) and is responsible for complying with the responsibilities for both sponsors and investigators to the extent they are applicable to the expanded access use, including submitting IND safety reports8 and annual reports and maintaining adequate drug disposition records. The responsibilities of sponsors and investigators are described in subpart D of 21 CFR part 312 and in related guidance documents, for example, in the guidance for industry Investigator Responsibilities--Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects.\n\nFootnote 8: For additional information about FDA\u2019s IND safety reporting requirements, please see the guidance for industry and investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe informed consent requirements in 21 CFR part 50 apply to treatment provided to patients under expanded access INDs, and informed consent must be obtained before initiating treatment, including in the case of emergency use, unless one of the exceptions found in part 50 applies.9 Additionally, the institutional review board (IRB) requirements found in 21 CFR part 56 apply (see SS 312.305(c)(4)), and IRB approval must be obtained before starting treatment under an expanded access IND unless it is for emergency use (in which case the IRB must be notified of the emergency expanded access use within 5 working days of treatment (SS 56.104(c)).10 Upon request, FDA intends to allow for waivers of the requirement for review and approval at a convened IRB meeting for individual patient expanded access INDs where the IRB chairperson or another designated IRB member provides concurrence, as described in the next paragraph.\n\nFootnote 9: For information on informed consent in general, see the draft guidance for IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors Informed Consent Information Sheet. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic. For additional information on the part 50 informed consent exceptions, see the guidance for institutional review boards, clinical investigators, and sponsors Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research.\n\nFootnote 10: An IRB means any board, committee, or other group formally designated by an institution to review, to approve the initiation of, and to conduct periodic review of biomedical research involving human subjects. The primary purpose of IRB review is to assure that the rights and welfare of human subjects are protected, including by determining that informed consent is obtained in accordance with and to the extent required by Federal requirements. Institutions may have their own IRB to oversee human subjects research conducted within the institution or by the staff of the institution. If the physician does not have access to a local IRB, an independent IRB may be used. The Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 Office for Human Research Protections maintains a database of registered IRBs. Go to https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/irbsearch.aspx?stvp=bsc and click on \u201cAdvanced Search.\u201d Enter your state to find registered IRBs in your area.\n\nFor individual patient expanded access use of an investigational drug, FDA intends to consider a completed Form FDA 3926 with the box in Field 10.b. checked and the form signed by the physician to be a request for a waiver under SS 56.105 of the requirements in SS 56.108(c), which relate to IRB review and approval at a convened IRB meeting at which a majority of the members are present.11 FDA concludes that such a waiver is appropriate for individual patient expanded access INDs when the physician obtains concurrence by the IRB chairperson or another designated IRB member before treatment use begins.\n\nFootnote 11: Form FDA 1571 does not provide a field for requesting a waiver under \u00a7 56.105. However, a physician submitting an individual patient expanded access IND using Form FDA 1571 may include a separate waiver request with the application.\n\nForm FDA 3926 and accompanying instructions may be found on FDA's website at https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/default.htm.\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/default.htm.\n\nIV Procedures and Timeline for Processing Form FDA 3926\n\nIn a non-emergency situation, after receiving Form FDA 3926 (i.e., the IND), FDA will assign an individual IND number to the IND and will either allow the treatment use to proceed or put the application on clinical hold (see SS 312.42). The IND will go into effect (i.e., treatmentwith the investigational drug may proceed) after FDA notifies the physician or, if no notification occurs, 30 days after FDA receives the completed Form FDA 3926. FDA generally provides the sponsor with notification acknowledging the complete submission. If the treatment use is not allowed to proceed, FDA generally will notify the physician of this decision initially by telephone (or other rapid means of communication) and will follow up with a written letter that details the reasons for FDA's decision to place the IND on clinical hold.\n\nIf there is an emergency and authorization of the expanded access use is requested before a written submission can be made, the physician must explain how the expanded access use will meet the criteria of SSS 312.305(a) and 312.310(a), as described previously in section II. In these situations, FDA may authorize the expanded access use of the investigational drug, and treatment may begin before FDA's receipt of the written submission (including the LOA), but the physician must agree to submit an expanded access submission within 15 working days of FDA's authorization of the expanded access use (SS 312.310(d)). When treatment involves the emergency use of an investigational drug and approval from an IRB cannot be obtained before treatment, treatment may begin without prior IRB approval provided the IRB is notified of the emergency expanded access use within 5 working days of treatment (SS 56.104).\n\nSecure email between FDA and sponsors is useful for informal communications when confidential information may be included in the message (e.g., confidential patient information). Parties who would like to establish secure email with FDA should email a request to\n\nSecureEmail@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nV Paperwork reduction act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.5255067348480225"], "This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: M3(R2) Implementation Working Group\n\nM3(R2) Guideline: Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the\n\nConduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization\n\nfor Pharmaceuticals\n\nQuestions & Answers (R2)\n\nCurrent version\n\ndated 5 March 2012\n\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use\n\nICH Secretarist, Chemin Louis-Dunst 15, P.O.

Harmonization of the guidance for nonclinical safety studies will help to define the current recommendations and reduce the likelihood that substantial differences will exist among regions.\n\nThis is a revision of the ICH guidance \"M3 Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals\" that published in 1997. The revisions further harmonize recommendations in a number of areas and include a new section on exploratory clinical studies. This revised guidance discusses other nonclinical studies that should be conducted on a case-by-case basis as appropriate, including phototoxicity studies, immunotoxicity studies, juvenile animal toxicity studies, and abuse potential studies.\n\nThis guidance should facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials, reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles, and reduce the use of other drugdevelopment resources. Although not discussed in this guidance, consideration should be given to use of new in vitro alternative methods for safety evaluation. These methods, if validated and accepted by all ICH regulatory authorities, can be used to replace current standard methods. This guidance promotes safe, ethical development and availability of new pharmaceuticals.\n\n2 Background (1.2)\n\nThe recommendations of this revised guidance further harmonize the nonclinical safety studies to support the various stages of clinical development among the regions of the European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States. The present guidance represents the consensus that exists regarding the type and duration of nonclinical safety studies and their timing to support the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals.\n\n2 Scope of the Guidance (1.3)\n\nThe nonclinical safety assessment for marketing approval of a pharmaceutical usually includes pharmacology studies, general toxicity studies, toxicokinetic and nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies, reproduction toxicity studies, genotoxicity studies and, for drugs that have special cause for concern or are intended for a long duration of use, an assessment of carcinogenic potential. Other nonclinical studies to assess phototoxicity, immunotoxicity, juvenile animal toxicity and abuse liability should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. The types of nonclinical safety studies and their relation to the conduct of human clinical trials is delineated in this guidance.\n\nThis document applies to the situations usually encountered during the development of pharmaceuticals and should be viewed as general guidance for drug development. Nonclinical safety studies and human clinical trials should be planned and designed to represent an approach that is scientifically and ethically appropriate.\n\nFor biotechnology-derived products (as defined in Ref. 1), appropriate nonclinical safety studies should be determined in accordance with ICH S6.3 For these products, ICH M3(R2) only provides guidance with regard to timing of nonclinical studies relative to clinical development.\n\nFootnote 3: The ICH guidances referenced in this document are available on the CDER guidance page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page.\n\nPharmaceuticals under development for indications in life-threatening or serious diseases (e.g., advanced cancer, resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and congenital enzyme deficiency diseases) without current effective therapy also warrant a case-by-case approach to both the toxicological evaluation and clinical development in order to optimize and expedite drug development. In these cases and for therapeutic modalities (e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA)), as well as vaccine adjuvants, particular studies can be abbreviated, deferred, omitted, or added. Where ICH guidances for specific product areas exist, they should be consulted.\n\nGeneral Principles (1.4)\n\nThe development of a pharmaceutical is a stepwise process involving an evaluation of both animal and human efficacy and safety information. The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterization of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exposure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility. This information is used to estimate an initial safe starting dose and dose range for the human trials and to identify parameters for clinical monitoring for potential adverse effects. The nonclinical safety studies, although usually limited at the beginning of clinical development, should be adequate to characterize potential adverse effects that might occur under the conditions of the clinical trial to be supported.\n\nHuman clinical trials are conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaceutical, starting with a relatively low systemic exposure in a small number of subjects. This is followed by clinical trials in which exposure to the pharmaceutical usually increases by duration and/or size of the exposed patient population. Clinical trials should be extended based on the demonstration of adequate safety in the previous clinical trial(s), as well as on additional nonclinical safety information that becomes available as clinical development proceeds.\n\nSerious adverse clinical or nonclinical findings can influence the continuation of clinical trials. Within the overall clinical context, these findings should be evaluated to determine the appropriateness and design of additional nonclinical and/or clinical studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.526787281036377", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not apply to pharmaceuticals intended for cancer prevention, treatment of symptoms or side effects of chemotherapeutics, studies in healthy volunteers, vaccines, or cellular or gene therapy. If healthy volunteers are included in clinical trials, the ICH M3 guidance should be followed. Radiopharmaceuticals are not covered in this guidance, but some of the principles could be adapted.\n\nGeneral Principles (4)\n\nThe development of each new pharmaceutical calls for studies designed to characterize its pharmacological and toxicological properties according to its intended use in humans.\n\nModification of \"standard\" nonclinical testing protocols generally is warranted to address novel characteristics associated with the pharmaceutical or with the manner in which it is to be used in humans.\n\nThe manufacturing process can change during the course of development. However, the active pharmaceutical substance used in nonclinical studies should be well characterized and should adequately represent the active substance to be used in the clinical trials.\n\nIn general, nonclinical safety studies that are used to support the development of a pharmaceutical should be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices.\n\nII Studies to Support Nonclinical Evaluation (2)\n\nPharmacology (1)\n\nPrior to Phase 1 studies, preliminary characterization of the mechanism(s) of action and schedule dependencies, as well as anti-tumor activity of the pharmaceutical, should have been made. Appropriate models should be selected based on the target and mechanism of action, but the pharmaceutical need not be studied using the same tumor types intended for clinical evaluation.\n\nThese studies can:\n\nprovide nonclinical proof of principle;\n\nguide schedules and dose-escalation schemes;\n\nprovide information for selection of test species;\n\naid in start dose selection and selection of investigational biomarkers, where appropriate; and,\n\nif relevant, justify pharmaceutical combinations.\n\nUnderstanding the secondary pharmacodynamic properties of a pharmaceutical could contribute to the assessment of safety for humans, and those properties might be investigated as appropriate.\n\nSafety Pharmacology (2)\n\nAn assessment of the pharmaceutical's effect on vital organ functions (including cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems) should be available before the initiation of clinical studies; such parameters could be included in general toxicology studies. Detailed clinical observations following dosing and appropriate electrocardiographic measurements in nonrodents are generally considered sufficient. Conducting stand-alone safety pharmacology studies to support studies in patients with advanced cancer is not called for. In cases where specific concerns have been identified that could put patients at significant additional risks in clinical trials, appropriate safety pharmacology studies described in ICH S7A and/or S7B should be considered. In the absence of a specific risk, such studies will not be called for to support clinical trials or for marketing.\n\nPharmacokinetics (2.3)\n\nThe evaluation of limited pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., peak plasma/serum levels, area under the curve (AUC), and half-life) in the animal species used for nonclinical studies can facilitate dose selection, schedule, and escalation during Phase 1 studies. Further information on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the pharmaceutical in animals should normally be generated in parallel with clinical development.\n\nGeneral Toxicology (2.4)\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer is to assess the safety of the pharmaceutical. Phase 1 assessments can include dosing to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicology studies to determine a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or no effect level (NOEL) are not considered essential to support clinical use of an anticancer pharmaceutical. As the toxicity of the pharmaceutical can be greatly influenced by its schedule of administration, an approximation of its clinical schedule should be evaluated in toxicology studies. This is further discussed in sections III.C and III.D (3.3 and 3.4).\n\nAssessment of the potential to recover from toxicity should be provided to understand whether serious adverse effects are reversible or irreversible. A study that includes a terminal nondosing period is called for if there is severe toxicity at approximate clinical exposure and recovery cannot be predicted by scientific assessment. This scientific assessment can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion and the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect. If a study of recovery is called for, it should be available to support clinical development. The demonstration of complete recovery is not considered essential.\n\nFor small molecules, the general toxicology testing usually includes rodents and nonrodents. In certain circumstances, determined case-by-case, alternative approaches can be appropriate (e.g., for genotoxic drugs targeting rapidly dividing cells, a repeat-dose toxicity study in one rodent species might be considered sufficient, provided the rodent is a relevant species). For biopharmaceuticals, see ICH S6 for the number of species to be studied.\n\nToxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate.\n\nReproduction Toxicology (2.5)\n\nAn embryofetal toxicology assessment is conducted to communicate potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are or might become pregnant. Embryofetal toxicity studies of anticancer pharmaceuticals should be available when the marketing application is submitted, but these studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. These studies are also not considered essential for the purpose of marketing applications for pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow) in general toxicity studies or belong to a class that has been well characterized as causing developmental toxicity.\n\nFor small molecules, embryofetal toxicology studies are typically conducted in two species as described by ICH S5(R2). In cases where an embryofetal developmental toxicity study is positive for embryofetal lethality or teratogenicity, a confirmatory study in a second species is usually not warranted.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticales, an assessment in one pharmacologically relevant species should usually be sufficient. This assessment might be done by evaluating the toxicity during the period of organogenesis or study designs as described by ICH S6. Alternative approaches might be considered appropriate if scientifically justified. The alternative approaches might include a literature assessment, assessment of placental transfer, the direct or indirect effects of the biopharmaceutical, or other factors.\n\nA study of fertility and early embryonic development is not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Information available from general toxicology studies on the pharmaceutical's effect on reproductive organs should be used as the basis of the assessment of impairment of fertility.\n\nA pre- and postnatal toxicology study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.\n\nF. Genotoxicity (2.6)\n\nGenotoxicity studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. Genotoxicity studies should be performed to support marketing (see ICH S2). The principles outlined in ICH S6 should be followed for biopharmaceuticales. If the in vitro assays are positive, an in vivo assay might not be warranted.\n\nG. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9600481390953064", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 14: See, for example, the ICH guidances for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals and S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals, and the guidances for industry Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products and INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nFor streamlined drug development programs addressing unmet medical needs for serious bacterial infections, sponsors should provide the following important nonclinical information about the investigational drug:\n\nIn vitro activity of the investigational drug, including the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) from a representative sample of target bacterial pathogens\n\nActivity in appropriate animal models of infection\n\nEvidence for the antibacterial drug's ability to achieve appropriate levels in relevant tissue sites from nonclinical studies (e.g., from appropriate animal models of infection)\n\nThe mechanism of action and whether mechanisms of resistance to other drugs affect its antibacterial activity\n\nThe evaluation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships from animal models of infection, such as the PK/PD index that is associated with efficacy in a relevant animal model and/or in vitro model(s) based on: (1) the area under the unbound plasma concentration time curve over the MIC; (2) maximum unbound plasma concentration over the MIC; (3) time above the MIC; or (4) other appropriate metrics\n\nThe target value of the PK/PD index that is associated with efficacy in the animal model\n\nDose and frequency of administration that was evaluated in in vitro models of infection based on PK parameters obtained from human PK studies\n\n4 What are clinical trial design considerations in a streamlined development program?\n\nDifferent approaches can be used to evaluate an antibacterial drug for the treatment of a serious bacterial disease in patients with an unmet medical need. The approaches outlined below are provided as examples that sponsors may consider using. These approaches are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive; in some cases combining elements from different approaches may be appropriate. Sponsors are encouraged to discuss their specific proposed development programs with the FDA before commencing clinical trials. The following are examples of trial design considerations.\n\nNoninferiority clinical trials\n\nThe efficacy of an investigational drug intended to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients with an unmet medical need can be established on the basis of a noninferiority trial in a population of patients who have treatment options for their serious bacterial disease. The trial population should include patients with severity of illness and/or comorbid conditions that are similar to those of patients who have an unmet medical need to have a finding of safety and efficacy that can be relevant to the patient population with unmet medical need (i.e., patients with infections caused by bacteria resistant to other available antibacterial drugs).15({}^{,})16({}^{,})17\n\nFootnote 15: Patients with unmet need may have greater comorbidities, altered pharmacokinetics, or disease severity that affect treatment effect and patient outcomes. Enrolling patients with these characteristics in the noninferiority trial should increase the generalizability to similar populations of patients who have unmet need.\n\nGiven that the antibacterial drug would be indicated for use only for patients who have limited or no treatment options, the characterization of efficacy in a noninferiority trial could be based on a larger noninferiority margin than is typically recommended in infectious disease-specific guidances but still establishes effectiveness.18 The labeled indication would specifically state that the drug should be reserved for patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options (see the response to Question 17).\n\nFootnote 16: A hierarchical nested noninferiority/superiority analysis can be considered if a sufficient number of patients with infection caused by bacteria resistant to the control drug are expected to be enrolled in the trial. See the response in Question 4.c., Nested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials.\n\nBecause there usually will be few patients, if any, who have an unmet medical need in the noninferiority trial, sponsors may want to consider an additional clinical trial in patients with an unmet medical need.19 The additional clinical trial can be conducted in patients with the specific type of infection studied in the noninferiority trial as well as other types of infections of comparable or greater disease severity. Ideally, a randomized active-controlled trial is the best option, if active control therapy is feasible and ethical, because then comparative safety and efficacy evaluations can be performed. Experience has shown that having a randomized comparator group can be particularly important for interpreting safety data from the trial (in small trials that enroll acutely ill patients, having a comparator group can help in evaluating adverse events that may represent background adverse events in this ill population). This trial does not have to be powered for inference testing. If demonstrating statistical superiority is planned, refer to the response in Question 4.b., Superiority clinical trials.\n\nThe additional clinical trial should collect information on patient comorbidities, disease severity, and pharmacokinetics, with comparisons to the patient population in the noninferiority trial (see the response to Question 7 regarding PK/PD considerations).\n\n4 Superiority clinical trials\n\nAn investigational drug can be compared to best-available active control therapy in a single randomized controlled superiority trial. Sponsors should discuss with the FDA the type of trial design (e.g., a trial enrolling patients who have a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) or who have different types of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated intra-abdominal infection)) and inferential statistical evaluations for a finding of superiority.\n\nThere may not be sufficient historical experience to clearly establish a reliable and reproducible treatment effect of the best available active control antibacterial drug therapy against placebo or no treatment. However, it is likely that it has a treatment effect greater than placebo or no treatment. Given this likelihood, it may be difficult to show unequivocal superiority for the investigational drug and it may be appropriate to use a less stringent statistical finding for superiority. In this case, an efficacy finding less robust than usual would be accepted as evidence of efficacy to enable the drug to be marketed because of the identified unmet medical need.\n\nA superiority trial design can be used to evaluate an antibacterial drug with activity against a single species (or a few species) of bacteria. A sufficient number of patients for enrollment into a trial of a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) may not be available. Patients with infections at more than one body site caused by the bacterial species of interest can be enrolled in the trial, with inferential statistical testing for superiority.\n\nA superiority clinical trial design that relies on an external control population may be appropriate to evaluate efficacy when the untreated morbidity and/or mortality is high and does not vary widely in the patient population with unmet medical need, and the effect of the investigational drug in an unmet medical need population is expected to be large.20 For an externally controlled trial, the control patients should be as similar as possible to the population expected to receive the investigational drug. Patients should have been treated in a similar setting and in a similar time frame, except with respect to the investigational drug therapy. For sponsors considering an externally controlled trial, we recommend randomizing at least a small number of patients to the active control (e.g., through disproportionate randomization of 4:1), if feasible and ethical based on an active control considered to be best-available therapy. This will allow for an assessment of the comparability of the external control to the trial population. Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods can then be used to combine external control data with data from the patients randomized to the active control in assessing differences between treatment groups for the primary comparison.\n\nNested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials\n\nPatients with and without unmet medical need can be included in a nested, active-controlled noninferiority/superiority trial design. Patients should be randomized to the investigational drug or the control drug before the availability of the results of antibacterial drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria causing the patient's infection because of the time required for results from susceptibility testing to become available using current technologies. The trial should include provisions for adjusting the control regimen to provide standard-of-care treatment for patients who are found to have resistant bacterial isolates at baseline. It is essential that adequate procedures be in place to protect patients enrolled in this trial from avoidable exposure to less effective therapy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7015239596366882", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important to ensure that the experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities of relevant stakeholders relating to the development and evaluation of the drug throughout its lifecycle are captured and meaningfully incorporated into drug development planning.\n\nClinical development may also feature requirements for co-development of validated biomarkers, diagnostic testing, or devices that facilitate the safe and effective use of a drug.\n\nThe types of studies that can contribute to drug development are described in subsections IV.2 (4.2) and IV.3 (4.3) and summarized in the Annex.\n\nQuality of Investigational Medicinal Product (4.1)\n\nEnsuring adequate quality and characterization of physicochemical properties of investigational medicinal product is an important element in planning a drug development program and is addressed in ICH and regional quality guidances. More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug's chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug's benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.34672677516937256", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nAbstract\n\nThis guidance was jointly developed by the E2B(R3) and M2 Expert Working Groups of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH process.

Repeated conversion could result in transformation or loss of information. Therefore receivers need to evaluate contents carefully. This document presents the recommendations for conversion agreed within ICH so as to provide a reference to system providers, and a common understanding on the way to convert ICSRs and ICSR acknowledgments (ICSR ACKs) between E2B(R2) and E2B(R3).\n\nBackground\n\nThe current pharmacovigilance databases are operating largely on the basis of the ICH E2B(R2) guideline and the DTD version 2.1. Whilst it is envisaged that ICH E2B(R3) will improve the current standards, it is obvious that there will be a time of transition until all stakeholders (regulators, pharmaceutical industry and other parties in the pharmaceutical business sector) have implemented the new guideline and have their pharmacovigilance databases adapted to these new standards.\n\nThis implies that pharmacovigilance databases operating ICH E2B(R2) and / or ICH E2B(R3) standards will have to coexist and mapping procedures must be in place to ensure a coherent and harmonized exchange of ICSRs among all stakeholders at the international level. This is even more important since the exchange of ICSRs takes place between multiple senders and receivers and therefore depends on the implementation status (E2B(R2) or E2B(R3)) of each party in each transmission.\n\nAs a result, it is of major importance to address the compatibility between the two guidelines and the relevant message specifications and to provide a mapping standard that will ensure a smooth transition phase.\n\nThe present appendix intends to\n\ndescribe the need for a harmonized and documented backwards and forwards compatibility\n\ndefine the method to address compatibility issues\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]\n\n3.2.2 Exchange Use Case\n\nWhen exchanging ICH E2B messages between a sender and a receiver, the message can be created and processed by systems running either the ICH E2B(R2) or the ICH E2B(R3) specifications. In such situation, there is a need to convert the file from E2B(R3) to E2B(R2) or vice versa.\n\nThe conversion will always occur on the receiver side, i.e., just before loading the case into the pharmacovigilance system.\n\nFigure 1: Use Case for Exchange\n\n3.2.3 Retransmission Use Case\n\nBased upon pharmacovigilance reporting requirements, E2B messages can be retransmitted between different senders and receivers. During this retransmission process, information previously submitted about the case should not be omitted or changed if no new information is available for retransmission. Recommended exceptions are listed in the E2B(R3) Specifications; these exceptions concern information available in both E2B(R2) and E2B(R3) information models.\n\nThe retransmission use case is described in the diagram below.\n\nIn such case, the conversions should ensure data integrity as much as possible, i.e., with limited loss of information. Ideally, the initial and retransmitted messages should be identical from a content perspective except for the information updated by the re-transmitter.\n\nThis appendix intends to provide the recommended rules to follow regarding the conversion of E2B messages (backwards and forwards) including the capabilities regarding the retransmission use case, and known limitations.\n\nFigure 2: Use Case for Retransmission\n\n3.3 Ensuring Data Integrity During E2B(R2) and E2B(R3) Conversions\n\nThe conversion use cases call for limiting the amount of data lost during the conversion process.\n\nConversion from E2B(R2) to E2B(R3) might result in some information being absent from the E2B(R3) formatted message because some of the data elements in E2B(R2) are no longer supported in E2B(R3), e.g., information on the receiver. Conversion from E2B(R3) to E2B(R2) should provide an abbreviated version of the data content because some data elements in E2B(R3) have been modified to increase the size of the text field, e.g., the sender's comments.\n\nTo minimize data lost during conversions, the following principles have been taken into account:\n\nIf a data element in E2B(R2) is not present in E2B(R3), this implies that related information might not be considered required and therefore this information can be omitted. For example, the information about the receiver in E2B(R2) has been removed in E2B(R3).\n\nIf a data element has been added in E2B(R3), this does not imply that current E2B(R2)-compliant systems would support the new information and therefore it is not always called for to convert the data to E2B(R2). However, the most important information will be converted to E2B(R2) as part of the case narrative section.\n\nFor the retransmission use case where re-transmitters manage several conversions between E2B(R2) and E2B(R3), re-transmitters parse the content of the case narrative section of E2B(R2) in order to reconstruct the E2B(R3) message as close as possible to the original message.\n\nThe case narrative section of E2B has originally a limited size (20,000 characters). It is recommended to amend E2B(R2) system and design E2B(R3) systems so as to support the case narrative section with no size limitation. This would allow the use of the case narrative placeholder to store the fields that cannot be converted directly, i.e., at the location where the fields appear in E2B.\n\nIf the E2B(R2) system cannot be amended to remove the size limitation on the case narrative field, it is then recommended to extract the information out of the case narrative field into an external file, for the information part coming from the conversion process.\n\n4.0 Approach Followed by this Appendix\n--------------------\nContext title: E2B(R3) The Electronic Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports Implementation Guide \u2014Appendix to the Implementation Guide \u2014 Backwards and Forwards Compatibility \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.459141731262207"], "Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.3 Step 1 - Determine That There is Sufficient Justification to Enroll the Subject Without Using a Translated Long Form to Document the Subject's Informed Consent\n\nThe investigator, in consultation with the IRB chairperson (or another IRB member designated by the chairperson, hereafter referred to as designee) whenever feasible, determines that there is sufficient justification (e.g., due to a limited therapeutic window) for obtaining the subject's consent without waiting for a translated long form to be reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to enrollment of the subject. In making a decision to allow enrollment of a subject who does not understand English into a research protocol without waiting for a written translation of the long form, the investigator (and whenever feasible the IRB chairperson or designee) should consider whether the consent process, under this circumstance, will provide the subject with sufficient opportunity to understand the information being presented. If consent is sought and the investigator believes that the prospective subject has not understood the information presented, then the individual should not be enrolled in the research.\n\n2.4 Step 2 - Obtain and Document the Subject's Informed Consent in Accordance with FDA Regulations at 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27 Using a Translated Short Form and the English Language Version of the Long Form as the Written Summary\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2), informed consent is documented using a short form that has been translated into a language understandable to the prospective subject and approved by the IRB. As a prerequisite to using this procedure, the investigator must have available a short form written in a language understandable to the prospective subject or LAR and previously approved by the IRB (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.27(a)). To meet this prerequisite, the IRB mustrequire that the sponsor or investigator arrange for translation of a generic short form into a language understandable by the prospective subject or LAR, and the IRB must have approved the prospective use of such short forms for enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, as needed. Additionally, the IRB must approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The IRB-approved English long form often serves as this written summary. The translator should be fluent in both English and in the subject's language. It may be appropriate to have a translator available for all subsequent study visits to relay information between the subject and study personnel.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining and documenting the subject's informed consent with a translated short form and an English version of the long form includes the following:\n\nThe investigator (or their designee) obtaining informed consent, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed (e.g., if the investigator is not bilingual), provides orally to the subject the elements of informed consent required by FDA regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 and any additional pertinent information included in the IRB-approved English version of the long form. This presentation may be an oral translation of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. The oral presentation must be in language understandable to the subject (21 CFR 50.20). The investigator, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed, answers any questions from the prospective subject. There must be a witness to the oral presentation who must not be the person obtaining informed consent (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Furthermore, FDA strongly recommends the witness be fluent in the language of the oral presentation. The witness must, at a minimum, have sufficient proficiency in the language of the oral presentation to be able to attest to the information that was to the presented orally to the prospective participant (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2).) In addition, if possible, the witness should not be related to the subject.\n\nAt the time informed consent is sought, the subject is given the IRB-approved translated short form and a copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form, which serves as the written summary.\n\nThe short form is signed and dated by the subject or LAR.\n\nThe witness signs both the short form and the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. (Note that when an interpreter assists the person obtaining consent, the interpreter may serve as the witness, but is not required to do so.)\n\nThe person actually obtaining consent signs the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form.\n\nStep 3 - Take Additional Actions Following Subject Enrollment\n\nAfter the subject has been enrolled in the research, the investigator takes the following additional actions:1. If a subject was enrolled in the research using an untranslated long form to serve as the written summary, and if the investigator did not consult with the IRB chairperson (or designee) prior to enrollment of the subject who does not understand English, the investigator should promptly notify the IRB chairperson (or designee) that such a subject was enrolled.\n2. The investigator must obtain a translated copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form that served as the written summary, which should be done promptly. The investigator promptly submits it to the IRB for review and approval. Once the translated long form/written summary is approved by the IRB, the investigator must provide it to the subject or LAR and should do so as soon as possible. FDA considers this step essential to the requirement that informed consent be documented by the use of a written consent document and that the subject be provided a copy (21 CFR 50.27). Many of the clinical investigations regulated by FDA involve ongoing interventions and may involve long-term follow-up. For this reason, translation of the long form is critically important as a means of providing subjects or their LAR an ongoing source of information understandable to them.\n\nAdditionally, as noted above in Frequently Asked Question#3, FDA recommends that whenever subjects who do not understand English are involved in research, appropriate interpreter services be made available throughout the course of the research.\n\nix.1.6 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\n\nAlthough a competent person who does not read and write well can give informed consent and enroll in a clinical investigation, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB should consider whether any modifications to the informed consent process are necessary to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable.\n\nFor subjects with apparent low literacy and/or low numeracy, oral presentation of the information contained in the consent document is especially important. When the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR, the IRB may want to consider approving the use of a short form and written summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)), which includes a witness to the oral presentation of the informed consent elements who also signs the consent document (see _section_III.E.4.b, \"Short Form\"). It should be noted that, even if the information is presented orally, the subject or the subject's LAR is required to sign the consent form (whether the long form or short form is used) unless the IRB has waived documentation of informed consent under 21 CFR 56.109(c).\n\nSubjects who cannot write can indicate their consent by \"making their mark\" on the consent document, in lieu of signing and dating the consent form when consistent with applicable law. In these situations, a note should be included in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21CFR 812.140(a)(3) indicating the reason for the lack of a signature and date as required by 21 CFR 50.27(a). The date consent was obtained should be recorded in this note.\n\nvi.2.7 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\n\nA person with physical or sensory disabilities (for example, physically unable to talk or write or has hearing or visual loss) can enroll in a clinical investigation if competent and able to signal consent consistent with applicable law. Enrolling such subjects into a clinical investigation does not require a LAR to be involved with the informed consent process or to sign the consent document unless required by State or local law. The records relating to the clinical investigation must include documentation of the informed consent process (21 CFR 50.27) unless excepted under 21 CFR 56.109(c). FDA recommends including in subject case histories required under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3) a description of the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to take part in the clinical investigation and how questions were answered. FDA recommends that investigators provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services when necessary to meet the specific needs of the study population.80 For example, for subjects with vision disabilities, the investigator could use an audio recording of the contents of the consent form or a consent form with enlarged font, depending on the degree of impairment.\n\nFootnote 80: FDA strongly encourages stakeholders to ensure that informed consent documents are accessible to individuals with disabilities. To the extent an organization receives Federal financial assistance from HHS, the organization must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This guidance provides information to assist IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\u2019s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. It does not provide guidance on how to comply with any regulatory obligations stemming from a source outside of the statutes FDA administers and FDA\u2019s regulations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.367149353027344", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject's rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the \"compensation\" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n\n51. Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n\nThe signed informed consent document is the written record of the consent interview. Study subjects are given a copy of the consent to be used as a reference document to reinforce their understanding of the study and, if desired, to consult with their physician or family members about the study.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, the consent document must be in language understandable to the subject. When the prospective subject is fluent in English, and the consent interview is conducted in English, the consent document should be in English. However, when the study subject population includes non-English speaking people so that the clinical investigator or the IRB anticipates that the consent interviews are likely to be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should assure that a translated consent form is prepared and that the translation is accurate.\n\nA consultant may be utilized to assure that the translation is correct. A copy of the translated consent document must be given to each appropriate subject. While a translator may be used to facilitate conversation with the subject, routine ad hoc translation of the consent document may not be substituted for a written translation.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheets: \"A Guide to Informed Consent Documents\" and \"Informed Consent and the Clinical Investigator\"\n\n52. Is it acceptable for the consent document to say specimens are \"donated\"?\n\nWhat about a separate donation statement? It would be acceptable for the consent to say that specimens are to be used for research purposes. However, the word \"donation\" implies abandonment of rights to the \"property\". 21 CFR 50.20 prohibits requiring subjects to waive or appear to waive any rights as a condition for participation in the study. Whether or not the wording is contained in \"the actual consent form\" is immaterial. All study-related documents must be submitted to the IRB for review. Any separate \"donation\" agreement is regarded to be part of the informed consent documentation, and must be in compliance with 21 CFR 50.\n\n53. Do informed consent forms have to justify fees charged to study subjects?\n\nFDA does not require the consent to contain justification of charges.\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\n54. Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized. An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.\n\n55. Does a clinical investigation involving a marketed product require IRB review and approval?\n\nYes, if the investigation is governed by FDA regulations [see 21 CFR 56.101, 56.102(c), 312.2(b)(1), 361.1, 601.2, and 812.2]. Also, see the information sheet entitled \"Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs and Biologics\" for more information.\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nWhich FDA office may an IRB contact to determine whether an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) is required for a study of a test article?\n\nFor drugs, the IRB may contact the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Communications, Division of Drug Information at (301) 796-3400.\n\nFor biological products, contact the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Communication, Outreach and Development, at (800)-835-4709 or (301) 827-1800.\n\nFor medical devices, contact the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Staff, Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at (301) 796-5640.\n\n57. What happens during an FDA inspection of an IRB?\n\nFDA field investigators interview institutional officials and examine the IRB records to determine compliance with FDA regulations. Also, see the information sheet entitled \"FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections\" for a complete description of the inspection process.\n\n58. Does a treatment IND/IDE [21 CFR 312.34/812.36 ] require prior IRB approval?\n\nTest articles given to human subjects under a treatment IND/IDE require prior IRB approval, with two exceptions. If a life-threatening emergency exists, as defined by 21 CFR 56.102(d), the procedures described in 56.104(c) (\"Exemptions from IRB Requirement\") may be followed. In addition, FDA may grant the sponsor or sponsor/investigator a waiver of the IRB requirement in accord with 21 CFR 56.105. An IRB may still choose to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. For further information see the information sheets entitled\"Emergency Use of an Investigational Drug or Biologic,\" \"Emergency Use of Unapproved Medical Devices,\" \"Waiver of IRB Requirements\" and \"Treatment use of Investigational Drugs and Biologics.\"\n\n59. How have the FDA policies on enrollment of special populations changed?\n\nOn July 22, 1993, the FDA published the Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs, in the Federal Register [58 FR 39406]. The guideline was developed to ensure that the drug development process provides adequate information about the effects of drugs and biological products in women. For further information, see the information sheet entitled \"Evaluation of Gender Differences in Clinical Investigations.\"\n\nOn December 13, 1994, FDA published a final rule on the labeling of prescription drugs for pediatric populations [59 FR 64240]. The rule [21 CFR 201.57] encourages sponsors to include pediatric subjects in clinical trials so that more complete information about the use of drugs and biological products in the pediatric population can be developed.\n\n6o. What is a medical device?\n\nA medical device is any instrument, apparatus, or other similar or related article, including component, part, or accessory, which is: (a) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them; (b) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in humans or other animals; or (c) intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body or in animals; and does not achieve any of its principal intended purposes through chemical action within or on the human body or in animals and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its principal intended purposes.\n\nApproximately 1,700 types of medical devices are regulated by FDA. The range of devices is broad and diverse, including bandages, thermometers, ECG electrodes, IUDs, cardiac pacemakers, and hemodialysis machines. For further information, see the information sheets entitled \"Medical Devices,\" \"Frequently Asked Questions about IRB Review of Medical Devices\" and \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.\"\n\n61. Are in vitro diagnostic products medical devices?\n\nYes. The definition of a \"device\" includes in vitro diagnostic products - devices that aid in the diagnosis of disease or medical/physiological conditions (e.g., pregnancy) by using human or animal components to cause chemical reactions, fermentation, and the like. A few diagnostic products are intended for use in controlling other regulated products (such as those used to screen the blood supply for transfusion-transmitted diseases) and are regulated as biological products.\n\n62. What are the IRB's general obligations towards intraocular lens (IOL) clinical investigations?An IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of all IOL clinical investigations. Each individual IOL style is subject to a separate review by the IRB. This does not, however, preclude the IRB from using prior experience with other IOL investigations in considering the comparative merits of a new lens style. All IOL studies are also subject to FDA approval.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.946074485778809", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: How do you obtain informed consent from someone who speaks and understands English but cannot read? Illiterate persons who understand English may have the consent read to them and \"make their mark,\" if appropriate under applicable state law. The 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) requirements for signature of a witness to the consent process and signature of the person conducting consent interview must be followed, if a \"short form\" is used. Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do.\n\nThe IRB should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to coercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated, see 21 CFR 56.111(b).\n\n41. Must a witness observe the entire consent interview or only the signature of the subject?\n\nFDA does not require the signature of a witness when the subject reads and is capable of understanding the consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(b)(1). The intended purpose is to have the witness present during the entire consent interview and to attest to the accuracy of the presentation and the apparent understanding of the subject. If the intent of the regulation were only to attest to the validity of the subject's signature, witnessing would also be required when the subject reads the consent.\n\n42. Should the sponsor prepare a model informed consent document?\n\nAlthough not required by the IND regulations, the sponsor provides a service to the clinical investigator and the IRB when it prepares suggested study-specific wording for the scientific and technical content of the consent document. However, the IRB has the responsibility and authority to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of all of the wording in the consent, see 21 CFR 56.109(a), 111(a)(4) and 111(a)(5). If an IRB insists on wording the sponsor cannot accept, the sponsor may decide not to conduct the study at that site. For medical device studies that are conducted under an IDE, copies of all forms and informational materials to be provided to subjects to obtain informed consent must be submitted to FDA as part of the IDE, see 21 CFR 812.25(g).\n\n43. Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n\nFor investigational devices, the informed consent is a required part of the IDE submission. It is, therefore, approved by FDA as part of the IDE application. When an IRB makes substantive changes in the document, FDA reapproval is required and the sponsor is necessarily involved in this process.\n\nFDA regulations for other products do not specifically require the sponsor to review IRB approved consent documents. However, most sponsors do conduct such reviews to assure the wording is acceptable to the sponsor.\n\n44. Are there alternatives to obtaining informed consent from a subject?\n\nThe regulations generally require that the investigator obtain informed consent from subjects. Investigators also may obtain informed consent from a legally authorized representative of the subject. FDA recognizes that a durable power of attorney might suffice as identifying a legally authorized representative under some state and local laws. For example, a subject might have designated an individual to provide consent with regard to health care decisions through a durable power of attorney and have specified that the individual also has the power to make decisions on entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding who is a legally authorized representative. Therefore, the IRB should assure that the consent procedures comply with state and local laws, including assurance that the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\"\n\nAlternatives 1 and 2 are provided for in the regulations and are appropriate. Alternative 3 allows a designated individual to provide consent for a patient with regard to health care decisions and is appropriate when it specifically includes entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding substituted consent. Therefore, the IRB must assure itself that the substituted consent procedures comply with state and local law, including assurance the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\n\n45 When should study subjects be informed of changes in the study?\n\nProtocol amendments must receive IRB review and approval before they are implemented, unless an immediate change is necessary to eliminate an apparent hazard to the subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). Those subjects who are presently enrolled and actively participating in the study should be informed of the change if it might relate to the subjects' willingness to continue their participation in the study (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). FDA does not require reconsenting of subjects that have completed their active participation in the study, or of subjects who are still actively participating when the change will not affect their participation, for example when the change will be implemented only for subsequently enrolled subjects.\n\n61 Informed Consent Document Content\n\nMay an IRB require that the sponsor of the study and/or the clinical investigator be identified on the study's consent document?\n\nYes. The FDA requirements for informed consent are the minimum basic elements of informed consent that must be presented to a research subject [21 CFR 50.25]. An IRB may require inclusion of any additional information which it considers important to a subject's decision to participate in a research study [21 CFR 56.109(b)].\n\n63 Does FDA require the informed consent document to contain a space for assent by children?\n\nNo, however, many investigators and IRBs consider it standard practice to obtain the agreement of older children who can understand the circumstances before enrolling them in research. While the FDA regulations do not specifically address enrollment of children (other than to include them as a class of vulnerable subjects), the basic requirement of 21 CFR 50.20 applies, i.e., the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative must be obtained before enrollment. Parents, legal guardians and/or others may have the ability to give permission to enroll children in research, depending on applicable state and local law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted. (Note: permission to enroll in research is not the same as permission to provide medical treatment.) IRBs generally require investigators to obtain the permission of one or both of the parents or guardian (as appropriate) and the assent of children who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved. Some IRBs require two documents, a fully detailed explanation for parents and older children to read and sign, and a shorter, simpler one for younger children. [For research supported by DHHS, the additional protections at 45 CFR 46 Subpart D are also required. The Subpart D regulations provide appropriate guidance for all other pediatric studies.] On April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Assent by children is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n48 Does FDA require the signature of children on informed consent documents?\n\nAs indicated above, researchers may seek assent of children of various ages. Older children may be well acquainted with signing documents through prior experience with testing, licensing and/or other procedures normally encountered in their lives. Signing a form to give their assent for research would not be perceived as unusual and would be reasonable. Younger children, however, may never have had the experience of signing a document. For these children requiring a signature may not be appropriate, and some other technique to verify assent could be used. For example, a third party may verify, by signature, that the assent of the child was obtained.\n\nAs noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject's rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the \"compensation\" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.059796333312988", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1354899406433105", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 58: See 21 CFR 56.109(b).\n\nInvestigators must use an IRB-approved written consent form when documenting informed consent, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27, except as provided in 21 CFR 56.109(c). Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, \"General Requirements for Informed Consent\" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD. Improving comprehension for cancer patients with low literacy skills: strategies for clinicians. CA Cancer J Clin. 1998 May-Jun;48(3):151-62. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.48.3.151. PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n\nThe investigator should notify the IRB of the consent process to be used. The process may be described in the protocol, or the investigator may provide a brief document describing the process to be used. The materials and procedures used for subject recruitment, which typically include advertisements, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB to ensure that these materials are appropriate, as described in section4.1, \"Review of All Informed Consent Materials\" (see 21 CFR 56.109(b) and 56.111(a)(4)).60 The IRB must determine that investigators will seek consent from prospective subjects under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). FDA considers this to include ensuring that the consent process described by the investigator allows sufficient time for prospective subjects to consider the information, provides time and opportunity for the subjects to ask questions and have those questions answered, and allows time and opportunity for the subjects to consider fully whether to participate.\n\nFootnote 60: For further information, see the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects.\n\nTo approve a clinical investigation, the IRB must find that informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's LAR and that informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4) and (5)). FDA recommends that the IRB inquire as to who will conduct the consent discussion and what procedures will be followed. If procedures other than a face-to-face consent discussion are proposed, such as by telephone, the IRB should consider whether the procedures will provide effective communication and accomplish the goals of the informed consent process. Alternative procedures may be of special concern when the clinical investigation involves complex procedures or when risks may be difficult to comprehend.\n\nFDA regulations authorize the IRB to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as well as the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should consider using this authority when it may be appropriate61 or enhance the protection provided to subjects (for example, when the investigator is alsothe treating physician for a prospective subject, when the person conducting the consent interview is relatively inexperienced, or when the clinical investigation involves vulnerable subjects). In addition to observing a sample of consent discussions, the IRB could interview subjects to assess the consent process and evaluate the subjects' understanding of the clinical investigation.\n\n3.3.3 IRB Review of Updated Informed Consent Documents\n\nAll information given to subjects as part of the consent process is to be reviewed and approved by the IRB (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).62 During the clinical investigation, new information about the research or changes to the clinical investigation may arise that affect the rights or welfare of subjects. FDA recommends that IRBs have procedures in place for the timely, efficient, and effective review of such new information or changes. This would include procedures for the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to notify the IRB of any significant new findings that arise during the clinical investigation relevant to a subject's decision to continue participation (see section3.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects\", and (\\mathtt{Frequently\\ Asked\\ Question}#16)). When new information or changes in the clinical investigation warrant revisions of the consent form (and any accompanying changes to the protocol), such revisions must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before the revisions are initiated, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)-(4)).\n\nFootnote 62: This would include all addenda to the consent form and other materials used in the consent process.\n\nSome changes may be reviewed and approved by expedited means, as provided for by 21 CFR 56.110. For example, an IRB may decide expedited review is appropriate for changes to the consent form that reflect minor changes in the protocol or recruitment plan (e.g., new advertising for subjects following initiation of the clinical investigation when the advertisement incorporates wording from the approved consent form). When expedited review is used, if the IRB reviewer is unsure whether the change qualifies for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110(b), FDA recommends that the reviewer (if other than the IRB chair) consult with the IRB chair. If doubts persist as to whether the change qualifies for expedited review, then the change should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB.63\n\nFootnote 63: As indicated at section4.2, when new information is added to the consent form that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research.\n\nAdministrative changes, such as the correction of typographical and spelling errors, and changes in telephone numbers, may be submitted to the IRB at any time, including during continuing review, and do not require formal review and approval. Although such changes do not need IRB review, updatedversions of the consent form should be sent to the IRB so that they have current copies of the informed consent form on file.64\n\nFootnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6870163679122925", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: The IRB may determine that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical investigations involving no greater than minimal risk to children to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.51, or clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk to children but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects in accordance with 21 CFR 50.52 (21 CFR 50.55(e)(1)).\n\nFor clinical investigations to be conducted in accordance with either 21 CFR 50.53 or 21 CFR 50.54,75 where permission is to be obtained from parents, the permission of both parents is required unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child (21 CFR 50.55(e)(2)).76\n\nFootnote 76: For additional discussion on what is meant by \u201cnot reasonably available,\u201d see the Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) recommendations at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/attachment-d-november-13-2018/indes.html.\n\nThe general requirements for informed consent, found in 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27, apply to parental permission (21 CFR 50.55(e)-(f)). When obtaining parental permission, in the event the parents of a child do not understand English, the parental permission must be obtained and documented in language that is understandable to the parents (21 CFR 50.20). The child who will be participating in the research should not be used as an interpreter for the parent, even if the child is fluent in English and may be able to assent. Similarly, if child assent is required, the information given to the child should be in language that is understandable to the child.\n\n\"Assent\" means a child's affirmative agreement to take part in a clinical investigation, not just the failure to object (21 CFR 50.3(n)). Child assent, when appropriate, and parental (or guardian) permission taken together meet the ethical requirement to obtain informed consent. Absent a waiver of the assent requirement (21 CFR 50.55(d)), the IRB must determine that there are adequate provisions for soliciting the assent of children when, in the IRB's judgment, the children are capable of providing assent (21 CFR 50.55(a)). In deciding whether children are capable of providing assent, the IRB must consider the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children to be involved in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.55(b)).77 A child does not need to fully understand the clinical investigation in order to provide assent, provided the child is capable of understanding the interventions and the related procedures. For example, a child may be able to understand and provide assent if the child understands and agrees to the interventions and/or procedures in the trial (e.g., drawing a blood sample for a test), even though the child may not be capable of understanding a randomized clinical trial.\n\nFootnote 77: FDA recognizes that IRBs may adopt procedures setting an age below which children are presumed incapable of providing assent.\n\nAn IRB may determine that assent is not necessary or may waive the assent requirement in certain situations (21 CFR 50.55(c) and (d)). For example, the assent of children is not a necessary condition for proceeding with a clinical investigation if the IRB determines that the intervention or procedure involved in the clinical investigation holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.55(c)(2)). Also, the IRB may waive the assent requirement for children capable of assenting if the IRB finds and documents that the clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; the waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; the clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver; and, when appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation (21 CFR 50.55(d)). Parental permission requirements (to the extent consent is required under 21 CFR part 50) remain in these circumstances.\n\nWhen the IRB determines that assent is required, it must also determine whether and how assent must be documented (21 CFR 50.55(g)). Some of the same considerations noted above for determining capability of children to provide assent should be considered when determining whether assent should be in writing or oral.\n\nWhen a written assent process is appropriate or required by the IRB, FDA does not require the use of a written assent form (21 CFR 50.55(g)), but FDA strongly encourages the use of a separate assent form that is \"child-oriented\" and developmentally appropriate. A separate assent form does not need to include all of the elements of a consent document but should focus on those aspects of the clinical investigation that may impact on a child's willingness to participate.\n\nParental permission and child assent should be viewed as an ongoing process throughout the duration of a clinical investigation. If and when a child who was enrolled in a clinical investigation with parental permission reaches the legal age of consent, that subject no longer meets the definition of a child under 21 CFR 50.3(o), and the investigator should obtain the subject's informed consent under 21 CFR part 50, subpart B, prior to performing any further research interventions and/or procedures involving that subject.\n\nIn addition, SS 50.3(o) defines children as \"persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted\". However, in some situations, a State may grant certain minors of a specific age the right to consent to treatments or procedures on their own behalf. These mature minors do not meet the definition of children for purposes of a clinical investigation that involves solely those \"treatments or procedures\" for which they can give consent outside the research context and thus, the requirements of 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, do not apply to the research with respect to these minors. Similarly, minors deemed \"emancipated\" by State law, such that they may provide consent to treatments and procedures in the clinical setting, also do not meet the definition of children under SS 50.3(o), and the requirements of 21 CFR part 50, subpart D do not apply to the research with respect to these emancipated minors. In these cases, the mature or emancipated minors can consent to participation in FDA-regulated research without the need for parental or guardian permission. For example, if a clinical trial is being conducted in a jurisdiction that has laws that explicitly allow a minor of a particular age, to consent to receive specific sexual transmitted disease (STD) services in the clinical setting, these minors may be able to provide informed consent for participation in a clinical trial of a product intended to treat or diagnose an STD.\n\n2.2 Are there any additional protections required when enrolling children who are wards of the state?\n\nChildren who are wards of the state or any other agency, institution, or entity can be included in a clinical investigation that is approved under 21 CFR 50.53 and 50.54 provided the clinical investigation is either: (1) related to their status as wards; or (2) conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not wards (21 CFR 50.56). In other words, one of these criteria must be satisfied in order for children who are wards to be enrolled in clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct benefit, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition (21 CFR 50.53) or clinical investigations not otherwise approvable that present an opportunity to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children (21 CFR 50.54).\n\nIf a clinical investigation is approved under 21 CFR 50.56(a), the IRB must require that an advocate be appointed for each child who is a ward (21 CFR 50.56(b)). The IRB must ensure that such an advocate is in place, but the IRB itself is not required to appoint the advocate. The advocate, who may serve as an advocate for more than one child, serves in addition to any other individual acting on behalf of the child as guardian or in loco parents78 (21 CFR 50.56(b)(1) and (2)). The advocate must be an individual who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interest of the child for the duration of the child's participation in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.56(b)(3)). The appropriate expertise for an advocate should include, but is not limited to, education and/or experience in pediatric medicine, law, child advocacy, foster parenting, behavioral sciences, or child psychology. The advocate should be adequately informed about the potential risks and benefits of the proposed clinical investigation, and about how the intervention is likely to affect the individual child. The advocate must not be associated in any way (except in the role as advocate or member of the IRB) with the clinical investigation, the investigator(s), or the guardian organization (21 CFR 50.56(b)(4)).\n\nFootnote 78: FDA considers an individual acting in loco parents to be an individual having the legal authority and responsibility to act in place of a parent.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.605362892150879"], "As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period.

(4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The QT/QTc interval data should be presented both as analyses of central tendency (e.g., means, medians) and categorical analyses. Both can provide relevant information on clinical risk assessment.\n\niv.1.1 Analyses of Central Tendency (3.2.1)\n\nThe effect of an investigational drug on the QT/QTc interval is most commonly analyzed using the largest time - matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Additional approaches to the assessment of central tendency could include analysis of changes occurring around the Cmax for each individual. This last analysis would be especially important if the drug has large between-subject variability in the rate of absorption or metabolism.\n\niv.1.2 Categorical Analyses (3.2.2)\n\nCategorical analyses of QT/QTc interval data are based on the number and percentage of patients meeting or exceeding some predefined upper limit value. Clinically noteworthy QT/QTc interval changes might be defined in terms of absolute QT/QTc intervals or changes from baseline. Separate analyses should be provided for patients with normal and elevated baseline QT/QTc intervals. As with all QT/QTc interval analyses, categorical analyses are most informative when it is possible to compare the rate of supra-threshold readings in the treatment and control groups.\n\nThere is no consensus concerning the choice of upper limit values for absolute QT/QTc interval and changes from baseline. While lower limits increase the false-positive rate, higher limits increase the risk of failing to detect a signal of concern. In clinical trials, a prolongation of QTc (>500) ms during therapy has been a threshold of particular concern. Multiple analyses using different limits are a reasonable approach to this uncertainty, including:\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>450)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>480)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>500)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval increases from baseline (\\star 30)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval increases from baseline (\\star 60)\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnalysis of Relationship Between Drug Exposure and QT/QTc Interval Changes (3.2.3)\n\nEstablishing the relationship of drug concentrations to changes in QT/QTc interval may provide additional information to assist the planning and interpretation of studies assessing cardiac repolarization. This area is under active investigation.\n\nMorphological Analyses of ECG Waveforms (3.3)\n\nWhile the predictive value of changes in ECG morphology, such as the development of U waves, has not been established, morphological abnormalities should be described and the data presented in terms of the number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group having changes from baseline that represent the appearance or worsening of the morphological abnormality. Typically these data will be obtained as a part of the \"thorough QT/QTc study.\"\n\nIV Adverse Events (4)\n\nIn addition to data on changes in ECG intervals, adverse event data can be another source of information on proarrhythmic potential, including:\n\nPremature discontinuations and dosage adjustments during clinical studies\n\nPostmarketing adverse event reports if available\n\nClinical Trial Adverse Events (4.1)\n\nAlthough drug-induced prolongation of the QT/QTc interval is usually asymptomatic, an increased rate of certain adverse events in patients taking an investigational agent can signal potential proarrhythmic effects. The rates of the following clinical events should be compared in the treated and control patients, particularly when there is evidence of an effect on the QT/QTc interval:\n\nTorsade de pointes\n\nSudden death\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nVentricular fibrillation and flutter\n\nSyncope\n\nSeizures\n\nTorsade de pointes is very infrequently captured in clinical databases, even those for drugs known to have significant proarrhythmic effects. Given this, the failure to observe an episode of TdP in a drug application database is not considered sufficient grounds for dismissing the possible arrhythmogenic risks of a drug when these are suspected on the basis of ECG and other clinical data. The other adverse events listed above, while less specific for an effect on cardiac repolarization, are more commonly captured in clinical trials, and an imbalance in their frequency between study groups can signal a potential proarrhythmic effect of the investigational agent. Sub-group analyses should be conducted in terms of age, gender, pre-existing cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, and concomitant medications. Comparing cause-specific ratesof death is difficult, but a difference in the fraction of total deaths qualifying as \"sudden\" has also been proposed as a marker for proarrhythmic potential.\n\nDetailed patient narratives should be provided for all serious cardiac adverse events, as would be the case for any serious event or events leading to discontinuation. In assessing the possible causal relationship of drug-induced QT/QTc interval prolongation to the event, attention should be directed to considerations such as temporal relationship and ECG results collected at the time of the event. As the QT/QTc interval is subject to considerable fluctuation, a possible role for QT/QTc interval prolongation should not be dismissed on the basis of normal on-therapy ECG measurements performed prior to, or near the time of the adverse event. In addition to an appropriate adverse reaction report, patients with marked QT/QTc prolongation or an episode of TdP might provide useful information on risk management. When identified, they should therefore be examined closely for other risk factors (e.g., genetic predisposition, see section IV.C (4.3)). Rechallenge with the investigational drug under appropriately monitored conditions can provide useful information on dose- and concentration-response relationships.\n\nIn evaluating the safety database of a new drug, consideration should be given to the extent to which the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient eligibility might have influenced the study population with respect to the risk of QT/QTc interval prolongation and associated adverse events (e.g., exclusion of patients with cardiac co-morbidities or renal/hepatic impairment, prohibition of diuretics as concomitant medications). Ideally, the major clinical studies should include an adequate representation of female and elderly patients, as well as patients with co-morbidities and concomitant medications typical of the expected user population.\n\nIf a subject experiences symptoms or ECG findings suggestive of an arrhythmia during a clinical trial, immediate evaluation by a cardiac specialist is recommended, both for the purposes of treating the patient and for discussions related to continuation/ re-institution of the therapy.\n\nPremature Discontinuations or Dosage Reductions (4.2)\n\nParticular attention should be directed to subjects or patients who are discontinued from clinical trials due to QT/QTc interval prolongation. Information should be provided on the basis for premature discontinuation of the patient (e.g., a QT/QTc interval value in excess of a protocol-defined upper limit, occurrence of QT/QTc interval prolongation in association with symptoms of arrhythmia), as well as the dose and duration of treatment, plasma levels if available, demographic characteristics, and the presence or absence of risk factors for arrhythmia.\n\nDosage reductions prompted by QT/QTc interval prolongation should also be documented.\n\nPharmacokine Considerations (4.3)\n\nMany forms of Long QT Syndrome are now known to be linked to mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channel proteins. Because of incomplete penetrance, not all carriers of mutated ion channel genes will manifest QT/QTc interval prolongation in screening ECG evaluations. Polymorphisms can affect ion channels, leading to an increased sensitivity to drugs that affect repolarization. Genotyping patients who experience marked prolongation of the QT/QTc or TdP while on drug therapy should be considered.\n\nPostmarketing Adverse Event Reports (4.4)\n\nBecause documented cases of TdP are relatively rare, even for drugs that prolong the QT/QTc, they are often not reported until large populations of patients have received the agent in postmarketing settings. The available postmarketing adverse event data should be examined for evidence of QT/QTc interval prolongation and TdP and for adverse events possibly related to QT/QTc interval prolongation, such as cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). A well-characterized episode of TdP has a high probability of being related to drug use, whereas the other events that are reported more commonly would be of particular concern if reported in a population at low risk for them (e.g., young men experiencing sudden death).\n\nV Regulatory Implications, Labeling, and Risk Management Strategies (5)\n\nRelevance of QT/QTc Interval Prolonging Effects to the Evaluation Process (5.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4088916480541229", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The predose baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.\n\nObtaining replicate ECG measurements (for example, the average of the parameters from about 3 ECGs) within several minutes of each nominal time point at baseline and at subsequent times will increase the precision of the estimated changes in QT/QTc effect.\n\nV Use of Concentration Response Modeling of QTc Data (5)\n\nQ12. The ICH E14 guidance states (in section III (3), page 12) that analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval changes is under active investigation. Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)\n\nConcentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n\nThere are many different types of models for the analysis of concentration-response data, including descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E({}_{\\text{max}}) models), or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. Itis recognized that concentration-response analyses of the same data using models with different underlying assumptions can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the modeling methods and assumptions, criteria for model selection, rationale for model components, and potential for pooling of data across studies be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Prospective specification of model characteristics (e.g., structural model, objective criteria, goodness of fit) based on knowledge of the pharmacology is recommended whenever possible. On occasion, the QT effect is not a direct function of plasma concentration. For example, drugs that cause QT prolongation as a result of changes in protein synthesis or trafficking or drugs with accumulation into myocardial tissues might demonstrate hysteresis. Testing for model assumptions, hysteresis (a plot of data by-time point and a hysteresis loop plot), and goodness of fit should be documented.\n\nConcentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity--multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites--contributes to the QTc effect.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nConcentration-response data would not necessarily come from a dedicated QT study, nor would it necessarily come from a single study. However, there are several new and important considerations that are described below.\n\nData can be acquired from first-in human studies, multiple-ascending dose studies, or other studies. Additional data would be useful to ensure information on exposure well above the exposure at the maximum therapeutic dose, to cover the impact of accumulation with repeated dosing, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, organ dysfunction, or genetically impaired metabolism. It is anticipated that one would collect new data to add to previous data, if appropriate, rather than use new data for independent analyses.\n\nEfficient concentration-response analysis using data acquired in studies with other purposes requires as much quality control as is needed for a dedicated study. This includes robust, high-quality ECG recording and analysis sufficient to support a valid assay for ECG intervals (see the E14 guidance and Question Q1 (1.1)).\n\nIf there is an intention to pool data from multiple studies, it is important to test for heterogeneity.\n\nIf there are data characterizing the response at a sufficiently high multiple of the clinically relevant exposure (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.2 (2.2.2)), a separate positive control would not be necessary.\n\nDecision-making\n\nBoth the intersection-union test and the concentration-response analysis can estimate the maximum effect of a drug treatment on the QTc interval, but they are not used to test the same hypothesis. As mentioned above, inspection of the time course of QT prolongation is important.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nHowever, hypothesis testing based on a by-time point analysis (intersection-union test or point estimate and confidence intervals) is inappropriate in studies designed for a concentration-response analysis, if not powered to assess the magnitude of QT prolongation for each time point.\n\nWhen using a concentration-response analysis as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the QTc effect of a drug treatment as estimated by exposure-response analysis should be (<10) ms at the highest clinically relevant exposure to conclude that an expanded ECG safety evaluation during later stages of drug development is not needed (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.4 (2.2.4), and Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n4.2.3 Other uses\n\nIn addition to serving as the basis for regulatory decision-making, concentration-response analysis has established its utility in several settings enumerated below.\n\n4.2.4 Providing insight into regimens not studied directly\n\nAn understanding of the concentration-response relationship can help predict the QT effects of doses, dosing regimens, routes of administration, or formulations that were not studied directly. Interpolation within the range of concentrations studied is more reliable than extrapolation above the range.\n\n4.2.5 Predicting OTc effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect pharmacokinetics\n\nUnderstanding the concentration-response relationship can help predict the effects of intrinsic (e.g., cytochrome P450 isoenzyme status) or extrinsic (e.g., drug-drug PK interactions) factors, possibly affecting inclusion criteria or dosing adjustments in later phase studies.\n\n5 Special Cases (6)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that in certain cases, a conventional thorough QT study might not be feasible. In such cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential? (6.1)\n\nIn certain cases, the conventional \"thorough QT/QTc\" study design (a crossover study in healthy volunteers with short-term administration of the usual maximum dose and one higher dose with placebo and positive control) might need to be modified for a drug or active metabolite with a long half-life or delayed QT effect, or because of safety, tolerability, or practical issues that preclude use in healthy subjects. In most cases, alternative designs can be used that may affect power considerations, but do not compromise study interpretation. For example, multiple doses can be studied in a parallel design trial or can use patients with the disease for which the drug is intended rather than healthy volunteers.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere a placebo-controlled comparison using appropriate doses is not possible, alternative study designs should incorporate as many of the usual \"thorough QT/QTc\" design features as possible, and the quality and extent of the preclinical evaluation (ICH S7B guidance) is particularly critical. Other useful supplementary data might include intensive ECG data acquisition in early phase single or multiple ascending dose studies, utilization of concentration-response analysis, and evaluation of exposures that are greater than those anticipated with the intended marketed dose.\n\nA single dose of a positive control is generally sufficient, even if it precedes the investigational drug treatment. In the absence of a positive control, there is reluctance to draw conclusions on the lack of an effect; however, if the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc is less than 10 ms, it is unlikely to have an actual mean effect as large as 20 ms.\n\nWhen a thorough QTc study of usual or modified design is not feasible, the intensity of late phase ECG monitoring will be dependent upon the quality and extent of the nonclinical and clinical evaluation. In situations where it is not possible to study higher exposures than are anticipated with the intended marketed dose, more intensive ECG monitoring might be necessary during phase 3 trials. When the nonclinical and early clinical data do not suggest clinically relevant QTc prolongation, intensive late stage monitoring might not be necessary. Otherwise, monitoring could be conducted as if a thorough QT study had been positive to protect patients in later trials and to obtain information on the frequency of marked QTc prolongation in the patient population (see Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n2.3 The ICH E14 guidance does not address the approach to QT measurement during drug development in the case of combination drug products. Is it recommended that measurement of QT prolongation be performed on drug combinations? (6.2)\n\nIn general, combinations of two or more drugs are unlikely to need a thorough QT/QTc study or intensive late stage monitoring, if the component drugs have been demonstrated to lack relevant effects in thorough QT/QTc studies as described in the ICH E14 guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs Questions and Answers (R3) Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.5194438099861145", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period.

Advanced methodologies for controlling (e.g., pacing) or correcting for heart rate changes in the nonclinical in vivo studies and/or conducting QTc assessments in the intended patient population might be informative in this situation. If tolerance to the chronotropic effect develops with repeat dosing, upward titration regimens can sometimes be employed to avoid or minimize the confounding effects of drug-induced heart rate changes on the QTc assessment.\n\nDecision-Making\n\nA totality of evidence argument based on the results of an integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc assessment could be made at the time of marketing application.\n\nA drug that meets the following criteria would be considered to have a low likelihood of proarrhythmic effects due to delayed repolarization:\n\nThe nonclinical studies, following best practice considerations for in vitro studies (see ICH S7B Q&As, section II (2)) and in vivo studies (see ICH S7B Q&As, section III (3)), show low risk as defined in ICH S7B Q&A Q17 (1.1).\n\nThe high-quality ECG data (see ICH E14 guidance and E14 Q&As, section I (1)) collected in the alternative QT clinical assessment do not suggest QT prolongation, generally defined under this Q&A as an upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc less than 10 ms, as computed by the concentration-response analysis or the intersection-union test.

The determination will depend on the quality and details of the clinical data (e.g., estimated QTc mean and upper bound values, slope of any concentration-QTc relationship) and nonclinical data (e.g., difference between the hERG safety margin for the investigational drug and the threshold for defining low risk).\n\nIf nonclinical studies do not show low risk (or are not performed), there is reluctance to conclude a lack of an effect in an absence of a positive control; however, if the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc is less than 10 ms, the treatment is unlikely to have an actual mean effect as large as 20 ms.\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance does not address the approach to QT measurement during drug development in the case of combination drug products.

Electrocardiograms Monitoring in Late-Stage Clinical Trials (7)\n\nQ16. The ICH E14 guidance describes in section II.C (2.3) (Clinical Trial Evaluation After the \"Thorough QT/QTc Study\") that \"adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this [monitoring] is not fully established.\" Is there now a reasonable approach to evaluating QTc in late-stage clinical development in the case of a finding of QT prolongation prior to late phase studies? (7.1)\n\nClarification of approach to evaluating QTc in late-stage clinical development\n\nThe purpose of a thorough QT study is to characterize the effect of the drug on ventricular repolarization (QT interval). It is not the purpose of the thorough QT study to assess the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in the target population, but rather to determine whether further data are warranted to assess risk. A finding of QT prolongation above the regulatory threshold of interest (a positive thorough QT study) might call for further electrocardiographic follow-up in late phase studies. The extent of the follow-up would be affected by the magnitude of the estimated prolongation at doses and concentrations at which this occurs. If prolongation is substantial at concentrations expected to occur in clinical studies, it is important to protect patients in later trials and to obtain further information on the frequency of marked QT prolongation. In some cases in which there is a large margin of safety between therapeutic exposures and the exposures that result in significant ECG interval changes, an intensive ECG follow-up strategy might not be warranted.\n\nThe recommended intensity of the monitoring and assessment in late-stage trials will depend on:\n\nThe magnitude of QTc prolongation seen in the thorough QT study or early clinical studies\n\n4.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe circumstances in which substantial QT prolongation might occur (i.e., in ordinary use or only when drug concentrations are markedly increased (e.g., by renal or hepatic impairment, concomitant medications))\n\nPK properties of the drug (e.g., high inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations, metabolites)\n\nCharacteristics of the target patient population that would increase the proarrhythmic risk (e.g., structural heart disease)\n\nThe presence of adverse effects that can increase proarrhythmic risk (e.g., hypokalemia, bradycardia, heart block)\n\nOther characteristics of the drug (e.g., pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, toxicology, drug class, hysteresis)\n\nThe following examples delineate the scope of recommended ECG investigations based on outcome of the thorough QT study or early clinical studies. These could be modified by other factors such as A through F above.\n\nExamples of ECG monitoring in late stage:\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,4 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapetic dose (relative to phase 3 dose) shows mean QTc effects between 10 and 20 ms. If there is reasonable assurance that the higher dose represents drug exposures that are unlikely to be seen in the patient population, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. This approach provides reassurance for safety because patients are unlikely to experience a clinically significant QTc effect. Footnote 4: A negative study, as defined by the ICH E14 guidance criteria, is an upper one-sided 95% CI of QTc prolongation effect (<10) ms.\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a positive finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,5 at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation (<20) ms. For drugs with this magnitude of effect on the QTc interval, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is called for. Footnote 5: Ibid.\n\nIntensive ECG monitoring in clinical trials has two main objectives. One objective is to provide protection to patients who might have large, worrisome QT intervals (>500) ms. A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late-stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency. Other than descriptive statistics, detailed statistical analysis is not expected. This monitoring is intended to be performed locally, without the involvement of a central core laboratory.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 and S7B Clinical and Nonclinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential--Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7245675325393677", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.5 Alternative Strategies to Assess QT/QTc Interval Effects\n\nAlternatives to the use of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' are under active investigation. Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, additional evaluation in subsequent clinical studies should be performed. One objective of this evaluation should be to fully describe the effect of the drug on the QT/QTc interval in the target patient population with particular attention to dose- and concentration-related effects. It is important to include patients in these analyses exposed to the full range of potential doses and patients with additional risk factors for TdP. These analyses would ordinarily focus on outliers as well as on changes in mean QT/QTc. Depending on the size of the effect seen in the 'thorough QT/QTc study', more intense monitoring of patients with additional risk factors for TdP might be needed.\n\nWhile what constitutes adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this is not fully established, additional ECGs collected appropriately in substantial numbers of patients in late phase clinical trials could provide this information. In this case, it would be important to collect ECGs at the anticipated time of peak drug effects, as determined in the 'thorough QT/QTc study' and pharmacokinetic information about the patient population.\n\nAnother objective of this evaluation should be to collect information on the adverse events that occur in the trials following the positive 'thorough QT/QTc study'. This would include patients who develop marked QT/QTc prolongation (e.g., >500 ms) or experience a serious cardiovascular adverse event that suggests an arrhythmia (e.g., TdP). Such patients should be evaluated closely for risk factors that might have contributed to this event (e.g., genotyping for Long QT Syndromes, see section 4.3).\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, analyses of the ECG and adverse event data from certain patient sub-groups are of particular interest, such as:\n\nPatients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia);\n\nPatients with congestive heart failure;\n\nPatients with impaired drug metabolizing capacity or clearance (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions);\n\nFemale patients;\n\nPatients aged <16 and over 65 years.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9879129528999329", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The QT/QTc interval data should be presented both as analyses of central tendency (e.g., means, medians) and categorical analyses. Both can provide relevant information on clinical risk assessment.\n\n3.2.1 Analyses of Central Tendency\n\nThe effect of an investigational drug on the QT/QTc interval is most commonly analyzed using the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Additional approaches to the assessment of central tendency could include analysis of changes occurring around the Cmax for each individual. This last analysis would be especially important if the drug has large between-subject variability in the rate of absorption or metabolism.\n\n3.2.2 Categorical Analyses\n\nCategorical analyses of QT/QTc interval data are based on the number and percentage of patients meeting or exceeding some predefined upper limit value. Clinically noteworthy QT/QTc interval changes might be defined in terms of absolute QT/QTc intervals or changes from baseline. Separate analyses should be provided for patients with normal and elevated baseline QT/QTc intervals. As with all QT/QTc interval analyses, categorical analyses are most informative when it is possible to compare the rate of supra-threshold readings in the treatment and control groups.\n\nThere is no consensus concerning the choice of upper limit values for absolute QT/QTc interval and changes from baseline. While lower limits increase the false-positive rate, higher limits increase the risk of failing to detect a signal of concern. In clinical trials, a prolongation of QTc > 500 ms during therapy has been a threshold of particular concern. Multiple analyses using different limits are a reasonable approach to this uncertainty, including:\n\nAbsolute QTc interval prolongation:\n\nQTc interval > 450\n\nQTc interval > 480\n\nQTc interval > 500\n\nChange from baseline in QTc interval:\n\nQTc interval increases from baseline > 30\n\nQTc interval increases from baseline > 60\n\n3.2.3 Analysis of Relationship Between Drug Exposure and QT/QTc Interval Changes\n\nEstablishing the relationship of drug concentrations to changes in QT/QTc interval may provide additional information to assist the planning and interpretation of studies assessing cardiac repolarization. This area is under active investigation.\n\nMorphological Analyses of ECG Waveforms\n\nWhile the predictive value of changes in ECG morphology, such as the development of U waves, has not been established, morphological abnormalities should be described and the data presented in terms of the number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group having changes from baseline that represent the appearance or worsening of the morphological abnormality. Typically these data will be obtained as a part of the 'thorough QT/QTc study'.\n\n4 Adverse Events\n\nIn addition to data on changes in ECG intervals, adverse event data can be another source of information on proarrhythmic potential, including:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.0682568550109863"], "In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: The 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7. What information did FDA rely on to make its determinations for the bulk drug substances that are addressed in the final rule?\n\nAs stated in the December 16, 2016 proposed rule, FDA considered information obtained from publicly available sources, including peer-reviewed medical literature. Some of this information was referenced in the nominations, and the remainder FDA gathered through independent searches of medical and pharmaceutical databases. FDA did not review raw data. The nature, quantity, and quality of the information FDA assessed varied considerably from substance to substance. In some cases, there were very little data. For other substances, reports in the literature were more plentiful and sometimes comprised hundreds or thousands of articles. In those cases, generally, the Agency limited its review to a sample of the best literature sources available (e.g., review articles in widely known, peer-reviewed journals; meta-analyses; reports of randomized controlled trials).\n\nQ8. What should I do if I want to use one of the four bulk drug substances that has been identified in the final rule as not being placed on the list to compound a route of administration or dosage form different than what the bulk drug substance was nominated and considered for when it was determined that it would not be placed on the list (e.g., the bulk drug substance was considered in the context of compounding an injectable drug product, but I want to use it to compound a tablet)?\n\nIf you would like to compound a drug product using a bulk drug substance identified as not placed on the list, you may submit a citizen petition under 21 CFR 10.30. The petition should ask FDA to consider revising the rule to include the bulk drug substance. The petition should explain any differences in how you propose to use the bulk drug substance as compared with how it was previously nominated and evaluated for inclusion on the list.\n\nQ9. Does FDA plan to add additional substances to the 503A Bulks List going forward?\n\nMany substances have been nominated for the 503A Bulks List, and FDA has been evaluating them on a rolling basis. FDA intends to publish additional notice and comment rulemaking to address whether these substances should be included on the list.\n\nQ10. Where can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule should be directed to Compounding@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Section 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers; Small Entity Compliance Guide; Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.001612663269043", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: The available evidence of effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of a drug product compounded with the substance, if any such evidence exists\n\nIn evaluating candidates for the 503A bulks list under these criteria, FDA is using a balancing test. No single one of these criteria is dispositive; rather, FDA is considering each criterion in the context of the others and balancing them, on a substance-by-substance basis, to evaluate whether a particular substance is appropriate for inclusion on the list.\n\nOnce the evaluation of a substance is complete, FDA will present the results of its review to the PCAC to obtain its advice on whether to include the substance on the list.20Section 503A requires that FDA create the 503A bulks list by regulation in consultation with the USP. To this end, FDA has been periodically meeting with USP and discussing the list. FDA will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that identifies substances FDA proposes for placement on the 503A bulks list and the substances FDA has evaluated but is not proposing to include on the 503A bulks list. After publication of the NPRM, the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. After considering the comments submitted to the docket, FDA will publish a final rule that establishes the 503A bulks list and identifies the substances that were considered and will not be placed on the list. FDA does not intend to evaluate all of the sufficiently supported nominations before publishing the first NPRM. Instead, after FDA has made a decision on whether to propose a group of substances (e.g., 10 substances) it intends to publish an NPRM with respect to that group of substances and continue to prepare the list on a rolling basis.\n\nA final rule will list the substances that FDA has determined can be used in compounding under section 503A and those substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A bulks list, if any.\n\nAfter a final rule is published, drug products compounded using the substances on the 503A bulks list will be eligible for the section 503A exemptions provided the drug product is compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A. Those substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A bulks list will not qualify for the policies described for the substances in Category 1.\n\n3 Policy21\n\nFootnote 21: See the Appendix for a chart summarizing FDA\u2019s interim policy.\n\nCompounding from Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\nUnder section 503A of the FD&C Act, a bulk drug substance that is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or is not a component of an FDA-approved drug cannot be used in compounding unless it appears on a list promulgated as a regulation pursuant to section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act. This list will be codified at 21 CFR part 216 subpart E.\n\nHowever, until a substance has been evaluated and is identified in a final rule as being included or not included on the 503A bulks list, FDA does not intend to take action against a State-licensed pharmacy, Federal facility, or licensed physician compounding a drug product using a bulk drug substance that is not a component of an FDA-approved drug product and that is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nThe bulk drug substance appears in 503A Category 1 on FDA's website at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Pharmac\n\nYCompounding/UCM467373.pdf. A Category 1 substance may be eligible for inclusion on the 503A bulks list, was nominated with sufficient supporting information for FDA to evaluate it and has not been identified by FDA as a substance that presents a significant safety risk in compounding prior to the publication of a final rule.\n2. The original manufacturer and all subsequent manufacturers of the bulk drug substance are establishments that are registered under section 510 (including foreign establishments that are registered under section 510(i)) of the FD&C Act);\n3. The bulk drug substance is accompanied by a valid COA; and\n4. The drug product compounded using the bulk drug substance is compounded in compliance with all other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nOriginal manufacturer means the entity that originally produced the bulk drug substance and not a subsequent packer, repacker, labeler, or distributor.\n\nThis policy does not apply to a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or a licensed physician, that compounds a drug using a bulk drug substance that does not meet each of the above conditions, and the bulk drug substance is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or a component of an FDA-approved drug.\n\n2 Substances Not Nominated or Nominated Without Adequate Support\n\nAs stated above, one of the categories of bulk drug substances FDA has identified on its website is substances nominated for the 503A bulks list that may be eligible for inclusion on the list, but that FDA is unable to evaluate for inclusion on the list at this time because the substances were nominated with insufficient supporting evidence for FDA to evaluate them (503A Category 3). In the Federal Register of October 27, 2015, FDA established a docket (October docket) where these substances can be re-nominated with sufficient supporting information or where nominations for substances that were not previously nominated can be submitted.\n\nAfter a substance is nominated to the October docket,22 FDA will determine whether the nomination is supported with sufficient information to allow FDA to evaluate it. After FDA makes that determination, the nominated substance will be placed in one of the three categories described in section 2.2 above, and the categorization will be published on the FDA website. Once the category of a substance is published, FDA intends to apply the policy described in Section 3.1 of this guidance to that substance. FDA generally expects to categorize bulk drug substances nominated to the October docket and to publish updated categories on its website on the first business day of each month. Please note that until substances nominated for the October docket have been categorized, the policy does not apply to those substances.\n\nFootnote 22: This includes re-nominations of substances with sufficient supporting information.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you feel that a substance that you nominated does not appear on the appropriate list or category as described in this guidance you can submit your comment to docket number FDA-2015-N-3534. If you have new information on a previously nominated substance that was placed in Category 3, the substance can be re-nominated with the additional information.\n\nA nominator may also submit a comment to the docket requesting withdrawal of any of its nominations. If the party nominating the substance was the sole nominator, FDA will update the categories described in this guidance to reflect the withdrawn nomination.23 FDA intends to provide notice to the public before removing any nominated substances from Category 1 or Category 2.\n\nFootnote 23: If multiple parties nominated the same substance, each party that nominated the substance must withdraw its nomination for the nominated substance to be considered withdrawn and for the categories to be updated to reflect that withdrawal.\n\nWithdrawal of a nomination upon the nominator's request and the resulting updates to the categories described in this guidance, do not reflect a determination by FDA regarding the validity of the nomination or of any reasons given by the nominator for requesting withdrawal. In addition, FDA may continue to evaluate a substance at its discretion even if the nominator submits a comment requesting withdrawal of the nomination.\n\nAppendix: Summary of Policy\n\nThe following table summarizes the interim policy for bulk drug substances set forth in this guidance:\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.906386375427246", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\nFDA seeks to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment while the Agency considers the bulk drug substances that were nominated with sufficient support to permit FDA to evaluate them and promulgates the regulations required under section 503A. Therefore, as described further below, FDA is issuing this interim guidance stating that it does not intend to take regulatory action for compounding drug products under section 503A using a bulk drug substance when an applicable USP or NF monograph for the substance does not exist and the substance is not a component of an FDA-approved product if, among other conditions, FDA has determined that the nomination for the bulk drug substance included adequate information for FDA to evaluate the substance and at this time, the substance does not appear to present significant safety risks.\n\nB. Efforts to Develop the List of Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\n1. Section 503A Bulks List -- Early History\n\nSection 503A was enacted in 1997 as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. In the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A and received nominations for 41 different drug substances. In November 1998, FDA published a guidance for industry, Enforcement Policy During Implementation of Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In this guidance, FDA announced that it would not normally take regulatory action relating to a drug product that had been compounded with a bulk drug substance that had been nominated for inclusion on the bulk drug substances list on or before November 21, 1999, while the substance was being evaluated, as long as the compounding complied with the other effective requirements in section 503A and did not appear to present a significant safety risk.11\n\nFootnote 11: The 1998 guidance was withdrawn in the Federal Register notice announcing the availability of the draft guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. See 78 FR 72901 (Dec. 4, 2013). The final guidance was published in July 2014.\n\nIn January 1999, after evaluating the nominated drug substances and consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) as required by section 503A, FDA published a proposed rule listing 20 drug substances on the section 503A bulks list (64 FR 996, January 7, 1999). The preamble to the proposed rule indicated that 10 of the 41 nominated substances were the subject of a USP or NF monograph, or components of FDA approved drugs and did not need to be considered for inclusion on the list.12 The proposed rule also described 10 nominated substances that were still under consideration for the bulk drug substances list and stated that one of the substances was withdrawn by its nominator at the first meeting of the PCAC. The PCAC reconvened in May 1999 to discuss bulk drug substances included in the proposed rule, in addition to other bulk drug substances (64 FR 19791; April 22, 1999).\n\nHowever, after a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that certain provisions of section 503A were unconstitutional,13 FDA suspended its efforts to develop the bulk drugs list under section 503A.\n\nFootnote 13: For additional legal history of section 503A, see the guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and cosmetic Act.\n\nBecause of the amount of time that had passed between the publication of the proposed rule and the enactment of the 2013 Drug Quality and Security Act, which removed the provisions of the FD&C Act that the U.S. Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional in 2002, FDA felt it was necessary to begin again to develop the section 503A bulk drug substance list. In the December 4, 2013, Federal Register (78 FR 72841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.2.2 Current Nominations for the 503A Bulks List\n\nIn response to the December 2013, Federal Register notice, over 2,000 substances were nominated for the 503A bulks list. However, many of the substances nominated for the 503A list were for substances that can be compounded without being on the list because they are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or are a component of an FDA-approved drug. In addition, many of the nominations were not for substances used in compounding as active ingredients, or did not include sufficient information for FDA to evaluate the nominated substances for inclusion on the list. To improve the efficiency of the process for developing the 503A bulks list, FDA reopened the nomination process in July 2014 (79 FR 37742) and provided more detailed information on what it needs to evaluate nominations for the 503A bulks list. FDA stated that bulk drug substances that were previously nominated would not be considered further unless they were re-nominated with adequate support to permit a meaningful evaluation. Substances that were already eligible for use in compounding or that were not adequately supported would not be evaluated for placement on the 503A bulks list.\n\nIn response to this request for nominations, approximately 740 unique substances were nominated. Of the nominated substances:\n\nApproximately 315 substances are already eligible for use in compounding under section 503A.\n\nThese are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or components of an FDA-approved drug product, which can be used in compounding pursuant to sections 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) and (II) and, therefore, can be compounded without being included on the 503A bulks list. To determine if a bulk drug substance is the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, see the USP-NF available at www.USPNF.com. To determine if a bulk drug substance is a component of an FDA approved drug, see the FDA's Orange Book:_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, available at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm.\n\nAt least one14 of the nominated substances is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nFootnote 14: The over-the-counter finished drug product Maalox was nominated. Maalox is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nThis is a finished drug product that was nominated by its brand name. Finished drug products are not eligible for the 503A bulks list because they do not meet the definition of a bulk drug substance in 21 CFR 207.3.\n\nAt least one of the substances is considered a biological product subject to approval in a biologics license application (BLA) under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act when used for the indication proposed in the nomination.\n\nThis substance is not eligible for the 503A bulks list because biological products subject to approval in a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act are not eligible for the exemptions in section 503A of the FD&C Act.15 No biological products subject to approval in a BLA will be considered for the 503A bulks list.\n\nFootnote 15: The nominated substance is sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate. See the revised draft guidance, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Products Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics License Application for FDA\u2019s proposed policies regarding State-licensed pharmacies, Federal facilities, and outsourcing facilities that mix, dilute, or repackage biological products outside the scope of an approved BLA.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.972378730773926", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: 2 Provisions of Section 503A That Require Regulations or Other FDA Actions\n\nSpecific provisions of section 503A of the FD&C Act require rulemaking or other action by FDA. FDA's policy related to these specific provisions is described below.\n\n2.1.1 Withdrawn or Removed List\n\nFDA promulgated a final rule, codified at 21 CFR 216.24, which lists drug products that cannot be compounded because they have been withdrawn or removed from the market because the drug products or components of the drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective. FDA intends to update this list periodically, and expects compounds to comply with the list as it currently exists and with any final updates.\n\n2.2.2 Bulk Drug Substances List\n\nSection 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act provides that a drug product can be compounded using bulk drug substances that do not have an applicable USP or NF monograph (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) of the FD&C Act) and are not components of FDA-approved drugs (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act) if the bulk drug substances appear on a list developed by FDA and issued through regulation.\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17,011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list. In the Federal Register of January 7, 1999 (64 FR 996), FDA published a proposed rule listing bulk drug substances that can be used in pharmacy compounding. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act. FDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\n2.3.3 \"Demonstrable Difficulties\" for Compounding\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act, a compounded drug product would not qualify for the exemptions provided in subsection (a) if it is identified by FDA through regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,840), FDA published a notice inviting all interested persons to nominate drug products or categories of drug products for inclusion on a list of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding (difficult-to-compound list). This provision is not enforceable until FDA promulgates an implementing regulation.\n\niii.1.4 Memorandum of Understanding Between FDA and the States\n\nSection 503A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act states that FDA, in consultation with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) will develop a standard MOU for use between FDA and the states that will address the interstate distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products and provide for appropriate investigation by a state agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside that state. On January 21, 1999, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of a draft standard MOU, developed in consultation with the NABP. This draft MOU was not finalized. FDA intends to publish a new draft MOU for comment that will replace the January 1999 draft.\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(B)(ii), an individual or firm in a state that does not enter into an MOU with FDA that distributes, or causes to be distributed, compounded drug products out of the state in which they are compounded, can compound for interstate distribution outside the state only 5% of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the individual or firm. FDA does not intend to enforce the 5% limit on interstate distribution until after FDA has finalized an MOU and made it available to the states for their consideration and signature. The Federal Register notice that will announce the availability of the draft MOU will specify a time period during which the MOU will be made available to the states to sign. After this time period expires, FDA intends to begin enforcing the 5% limit in states that have not signed the MOU.\n\nIV Guidance on Regulatory Action\n\nRequirements Applicable to Drug Products that Meet the Conditions of Section 503a\n\nAs stated above, a compounded drug product intended for use in humans that meets the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act and its associated regulations is exempt from the requirements under sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.\n\nHowever, individuals and firms may be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of other requirements of the FD&C Act. Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe drug product must not consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health. (Sections 501(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, its strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, the standards set forth in the compendium, unless the difference is plainly stated on its label. (Section 501(b) of the FD&C Act)3. For a drug product not subject to section 501(b) of the FD&C Act, the drug's strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, that which it purports to have. (Section 501(c) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, it must be packaged and labeled as prescribed in the compendium. (Section 502(g) of the FD&C Act)\n\nThe drug product's labeling, advertising, and promotion must not be false or misleading. (Sections 502(a), 502(bb),10 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act)\n\nFootnote 10: Section 502(bb) was added to the FD&C Act by section 103(b) of the DQSA.\n\n2 Enforcement Action When a Drug Does Not Meet the Conditions of Section 503A\n\nIf FDA determines that an individual or firm compounds a drug product that does not meet the conditions of section 503A, then in addition to the violations listed above in section IV.A., the individual or firm that compounds the drug product may also be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.11 Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFootnote 11: See Medical Ctr. Pharm. v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 383, 405 (5th Cir. 2008) (\u201ccompounded drugs are in fact \u2018new drugs\u2019 as defined by [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 321(p) but are exempt from the requirements of [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1), and 355 if and only if they comply with the conditions set forth in [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 353a.\u201d).\n\n2.2.1 Producing Adulterated Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR parts 210 and 211, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of a drug must conform with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to CGMP requirements.\n\n2.2 Producing Unapproved New Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm must not introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug unless an approved NDA or ANDA is in effect for that drug product. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the new drug approval requirements.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 201.5, drug products that are not labeled with adequate directions for use are misbranded. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the requirements for adequate directions for use.\n\nIn addition to sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm that compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act would be subject to the requirements listed in section IV.A, above, as well as other requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nEnforcement Approach\n\nGenerally, FDA expects to employ a risk-based enforcement approach with respect to violative compounded drugs, giving the highest enforcement priority to compounded drugs and violations of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations that pose the greatest public health risks. However, FDA emphasizes that it need not identify a particular safety problem before pursuing enforcement action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.113295078277588", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Section 503A Bulks List\n\nFinal Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nMay 2019\n\nCompoundingSection 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4th Floor Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 Phone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353 Email: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nMay 2019\n\nCompounding\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nSection 503A Bulks List Final Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Regulatory Policy and the Office of Unapproved Drug Labeling Compliance in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing the list of bulk drug substances2 that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 353a) (final rule or 503A Bulks List Final Rule). On February 19, 2019 (84 FR 4696), FDA published a final rule that establishes FDA's criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that may be used to compound drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act (the 503A Bulks List or the list) and that places six substances on the list. The final rule, entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" also identifies four substances that were considered for and not included on the list.\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is evaluating bulk drug substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List on a rolling basis and intends to address additional substances in future rulemaking.\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. FDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)3 to assist small businesses in complying with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 3: 5 U.S.C. 601.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions under which a compounded drug product qualifies for exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act related to FDA approval prior to marketing, current good manufacturing practice requirements, and labeling with adequate directions for use. One of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility or a licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that (1) comply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by FDA; or (3) if such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by FDA, appear on a list of bulk drug substances developed by FDA through regulation.4\n\nFootnote 4: See section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a(b)(1)(A)(i)).\n\nAs noted above, the 503A Bulks List Final Rule establishes criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the 503A Bulks List, identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list, and identifies four other bulk drug substances that were considered and are not being included on the 503A Bulks List.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule addresses only 10 of the substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List. The final rule identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list: Brilliant Blue G, also known as Coomassiee Brilliant Blue G-250; cantharidin (for topical use only); diphenylcyclopropone (for topical use only); N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) (for topical use only); squaric acid dibutyl ester (for topical use only); and thymol iodide (for topical use only). The final rule also identifies four other bulk drug substances that are not being included on the list: oxitriptan, piracetam, silver protein mild, and tranilast.\n\nAlthough only the 10 substances listed above are specifically addressed in the final rule, the criteria for evaluation identified in the final rule will be applied to all bulk drug substances that are considered for the 503A Bulks List.\n\nCan substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n\nNo. As stated above, section 503A provides compounded drug products with exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act, including premarket approval, but only when those compounded drug products meet the conditions of section 503A. A compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that are not being placed on the list would not meet those conditions and therefore would not qualify for the exemptions from the FD&C Act.\n\nIn addition, as described in the Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry,5 substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A Bulks List no longer qualify for the interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances.\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, be sure to check the Agency\u2019s guidance website at http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDABasicsforIndustry/ucm234622.htm.\n\nQ3. What should I do if I am a pharmacist and I receive a prescription for a compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that is not being placed on the 503A Bulks List as part of this final rule?\n\nA drug product compounded using a bulk drug substance that is identified in a final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List does not qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act. Compounding with any of the four substances identified in the 503A Bulks List Final Rule, or with substances identified in any other final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List, may subject the compounder to regulatory action.\n\nQ4. When and how do compounders have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction and scope\n\nThis guidance sets forth the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or Agency) interim regulatory policy concerning compounding using bulk drug substances under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or Act). Section 503A of the FD&C Act includes certain restrictions on the bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding and directs FDA to develop a list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under that section. FDA is developing this list of bulk drug substances (the 503A bulks list), and this guidance describes FDA's interim regulatory policy for licensed pharmacists in State-licensed pharmacies and Federal facilities and for licensed physicians that compound human drug products using bulk drug substances while the list is being developed.2,3\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not apply to drugs compounded from bulk drug substances for use in animals. For proposed policies pertaining to compounding drug products from bulk drug substances for use in animals, see FDA\u2019s draft guidance, Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances.\n\nAll FDA guidances are available on the FDA guidance web page. FDA updates guidances regularly. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, always consult the guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformationGuidances/default.htm.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nCompounding From Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Act\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be satisfied for human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or by a licensed physician, to be exempt from the following three sections of the FD&C Act: section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug applications or abbreviated new drug applications); section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning current good manufacturing practice requirements).\n\nOne of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that:\n\nComply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary (NF) monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding;\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by the Secretary; or\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by the Secretary, appears on a list developed by the Secretary through regulations issued by the Secretary under subsection (c) of section 503A.4 Footnote 4: See Section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nA bulk drug substance is defined as meaning \"the same as active pharmaceutical ingredient as defined in 21 CFR 207.1(b).\" See 21 CFR 207.3. Active pharmaceutical ingredient is defined as \"any substance that is intended for incorporation into a finished drug product and is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body,\" but the term \"does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of the substance\" (see section 503A(b)(1)(A) and 21 CFR 207.3).5({}^{,})6 FDA has interpreted \"an applicable USP or NFmonograph\" to mean an official USP or NF drug substance monograph. Accordingly, FDA does not consider USP monographs for dietary supplements to be \"applicable\" USP or NF monographs within the meaning of section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I).\n\nUnder section 503A(c)(1), before developing this list through regulation, FDA must convene and consult an advisory committee on compounding unless FDA determines that the issuance of such regulation before consultation with the advisory committee is necessary to protect the public health. FDA must also consult with USP when promulgating the regulations.7 The criteria for determining which bulk drug substances should appear on the section 503A bulks list \"shall include historical use, reports in peer reviewed medical literature, or other criteria the Secretary may identify.\"8\n\nFootnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1836352348327637"], "As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Pediatric Study Plans:\n\nContent of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans Guidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJuly 2020\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAbstract\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.

Specifically, this guidance provides the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding implementation of the requirement for sponsors to submit an iPSP, described in section 505B(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).\n\nThis guidance addresses the following:\n\nApplications for which an iPSP is required\n\nTiming of an iPSP submission\n\nContent of an iPSP\n\nContent and timing of a requested amendment to an agreed iPSP\n\nA template that is recommend to be used for an iPSP submission2\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\ngiven by the FDA at the end-of-phase 1 meeting, for drugs for life-threatening diseases,7 and at the end-of-phase 2 meeting, for other drugs.8\n\nFootnote 7: See 21 CFR 312.81(a).\n\nFootnote 8: For additional information on end-of-phase 1 meetings and end-of-phase 2 meetings, see 21 CFR 312.47(b) and 312.82(b).\n\nThe pediatric rule also stated that sponsors should submit, at least 1 month in advance of the end-of-phase 2 meeting, certain background information, including a proposed timeline for protocol finalization, enrollment, completion, and data analysis, or, in the alternative, information to support a planned request for waiver or deferral. However, on October 17, 2002, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that the FDA had exceeded its statutory authority when issuing the pediatric rule and the court enjoined the rule's enforcement.9\n\nFootnote 9: Association of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. FDA, 226 F. Supp. 2d 204, 222 (D.D.C. 2002).\n\nCongress subsequently passed PREA, which was signed into law on December 3, 2003.10 Many of the provisions described under the pediatric rule were adopted under PREA. Under PREA as originally enacted and under its reauthorization under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007,11 a sponsor was not required to submit a proposed timeline and plan for the submission of pediatric studies during the investigational new drug application (IND) phase of drug development. Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), signed into law on July 9, 2012, for the first time PREA12 includes a provision that requires a sponsor planning to submit an application for a drug subject to PREA to submit an iPSP early in the development process.13 The intent of the iPSP is for a sponsor to identify needed pediatric studies early in development and begin planning for these studies. Early dialogue with the FDA on a comprehensive pediatric development plan, including both required pediatric studies under PREA and potential pediatric uses under the BPCA, is intended to result in a more efficient pediatric drug development program. The timing and content of the submission of an iPSP are described below. The FD&C Act, as amended by FDASIA, requires the FDA to issue regulations and guidance to implement these and other provisions.14\n\nFootnote 10: Public Law 108-155, 117 Stat. 1936 (Dec. 3, 2003).\n\nFootnote 11: Public Law 110-85, 121 Stat. 823 (Sept. 27, 2007).\n\nFootnote 12: By convention, section 505B is often referred to as PREA, after the act that added that section to the FD&C Act. We follow that naming convention in this guidance.\n\nThe FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA), further updated PREA with respect to certain drugs intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer, and for which an original marketing application is submitted on or after August 18, 2020.15\n\nFootnote 15: Public Law 115-52, 131 Stat. 1005 (Aug. 18, 2017).

When finalized, these guidances will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on these topics.

In the absence of an end-of-phase 2 meeting, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as early as practicable but before the initiation of any phase 3 studies, or any combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies, of the drug that is the subject of the iPSP. If a phase 3 study, or a combined phase 2 and phase 3 study, will not be conducted or will be conducted but not under IND, the sponsor should submit the iPSP no later than 210 calendar days before it submits a marketing application or supplement. Sponsors should contact the appropriate component of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research if they believe exceptional circumstances exist.\n\nFootnote 22: See section 505B(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(A).\n\nThe sponsor should submit the iPSP to the relevant drug's IND for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research as appropriate. In cases where the sponsor has no active IND for the drug but the sponsor expects to open the IND with an initial phase 3 study, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as a pre-IND submission. In this situation, the FDA encourages the sponsor to schedule a pre-IND meeting before submission of the iPSP, and such submission should precede initiation of any phase 3 studies or combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies. In cases where the drug development program includes the possibility of using expedited programs,23 the FDA encourages the sponsor to have discussions about the pediatric development plans with the review division as early as possible.\n\nFootnote 23: For further information on expedited programs, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions\u2014Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.0075278282165527", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors are encouraged to submit an initial pediatric study plan as soon as practicable.17 Footnote 16: For the purposes of this guidance, adolescents are defined as age 12 to younger than 18 years of age.\n\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, all applications for new active ingredients (which includes new salts and new fixed combinations), new indications, new dosage forms, new dosing regimens, or new routes ofadministration, are required to contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication or indications in pediatric populations unless this requirement is waived, deferred, or inapplicable.18 FDA intends to work with sponsors to reach agreement on the initial pediatric study plan and any pediatric trial protocols as quickly as possible to avoid any unnecessary delays in the initiation of trials or submission of any marketing application. Footnote 18: See 21 U.S.C 355c.\n\n2.2.2 Trial Design and Conduct\n\nSponsors of drugs to treat COVID-19 should consider the following:\n\nFDA strongly recommends that drugs to treat COVID-19 be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials using a superiority design. In some situations, use of an active control with a superiority or noninferiority design19 may be appropriate.20 Footnote 19: The noninferiority margin must be sufficiently supported to conduct a noninferiority trial and the justification should be discussed with FDA. See the guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness (November 2016).\n\nBackground standard of care should be maintained in all treatment arms.\n\nThe standard of care is expected to change as additional information, such as from randomized controlled trials, emerges. Where treatments become standard of care for specific COVID-19 populations (e.g., severely ill hospitalized patients), trials in these populations should generally be designed as placebo-controlled superiority studies with an add-on design (i.e., the investigational agent or placebo added on to the standard of care agent). For agents with a similar mechanism of action as the standard of care (e.g., direct antiviral agent as the investigational agent when the new standard of care is also a direct antiviral agent), an active-comparator controlled study design may be considered if there is sufficient preclinical and initial clinical evidence of activity of the investigational agent. Sponsors should plan early discussion with the appropriate clinical division.\n\nSponsors should address the possibility of drug and COVID-19 vaccine interactions for drugs that may interfere with vaccine effectiveness (i.e., monoclonal antibodies targeting the vaccine antigen). Sponsors should consult with the Agency early in the development program for such drugs.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is evolving as it spreads through the human population, and emergent\nSARS-CoV-2 genetic changes may impact the effectiveness of antiviral drugs. In addition, using an antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 may contribute to the emergence of viruses with reduced susceptibility to the drug or to other approved or investigational drugs. Sponsors should characterize drug resistance pathways and the potential for cross-resistance to other drugs using both nonclinical and clinical studies. Details regarding drug resistance analysis are provided in Appendix B. Sponsors should also refer to the guidance for industry Development of Monoclonal Antibody Products Targeting SARS-CoV-2, Including Addressing the Impact of Emerging Variants, During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (February 2021) and the guidance for industry Antiviral Product Development--Conducting and Submitting Virology Studies to the Agency (June 2006).\n\nClinical trial protocols should include plans to characterize the impact of drugs on viral shedding and immune responses as described in Appendix C.\n\nGiven infection control concerns associated with COVID-19, sponsors should consider remote collection of data when possible and limit in-person data collection to important assessments that cannot be obtained without face-to-face interaction. FDA recognizes the important role of decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) in COVID-19 drug development, as they provide options for data collection particularly suited to the pandemic setting.\n\nDCTs may involve different levels of decentralization. In trials that are fully decentralized, all activities take place at locations remote from investigators (e.g., patients' homes).21 In partially decentralized trials, some activities involve in-person visits at the investigator's traditional trial site while other visits are conducted elsewhere.\n\nSponsors should consider several factors when determining if conducting a DCT is appropriate, selecting the location of a trial visit, and/or selecting personnel performing an assessment. These factors include the following: Footnote 21: See the guidance for industry, investigators, and institutional review boards Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Health Emergency (March 2020).\n\nThe severity of COVID-19\n\nThe nature of the investigational product (e.g., ease of administration, safety profile, stability profile, storage conditions)\n\nThe type of trial procedure or assessment (e.g., administration of investigational product, clinical laboratory assessment, clinical outcome assessment, or adverse event assessment/follow-up).\n\nSponsors considering a DCT should plan early discussions with the appropriate review division, as a DCT may introduce additional complexities related to feasibility, design, implementation, and analysis of the data.\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGiven the expected fluctuation in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection across regions, sponsors should address the need to open new sites and potentially suspend existing sites.\n\nThe trial should be of sufficient duration to reliably evaluate safety and effectiveness. The duration should be adequate to capture the efficacy outcomes relevant for the population under study. Additionally, longer follow-up for safety may be warranted.\n\nWhen there is compelling preclinical or preliminary clinical evidence, it may be appropriate to move directly to conduct a trial of sufficient size and appropriate design to contribute to substantial evidence of effectiveness and adequate characterization of safety. Sponsors should discuss their intended approach early with the appropriate review division.\n\nIn instances of limited information supporting the potential for efficacy,22 approaches where an initial assessment of potential benefit can be made before enrolling a large number of subjects are appropriate. These approaches may include the following:\n\nConducting an initial small, controlled trial to assess for drug activity (proof-of-concept) that suggests the potential for clinical benefit. Footnote 22: See the guidance for industry and investigators COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: General Considerations for Pre-IND Meeting Requests for COVID-19 Related Drugs and Biological Products, which describes the information and data recommended to support FDA\u2019s review for the initiation of clinical trials during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nConducting a phase 2 or phase 3 trial that incorporates prospectively planned criteria to stop the trial for futility (i.e., with the prospect of expanding from a proof-of-concept phase to a larger confirmatory trial). Such a trial might also incorporate additional prospectively planned adaptations (see additional comments on adaptive design proposals below).\n\nFDA encourages sponsors to use an independent, external data monitoring committee (DMC) to ensure subject safety and trial integrity.\n\nSponsors should submit the DMC charter to FDA before enrolling patients.\n\nSponsors should ensure there will be appropriate DMC monitoring to safeguard the welfare of subjects, accounting for important factors such as the expected enrollment rate, the expected lag time to analyze interim data for DMC meetings, and the frequency of DMC meetings.23 Footnote 23: See the guidance for industry Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees (March 2006). FDA has also proposed relevant recommendations in the draft guidance for industry Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting (December 2015). When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nIf enrollment is anticipated to be rapid, but additional safety data are needed before dosing a large number of subjects, an enrollment pause should be built into the trial.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: COVID-19- Developing Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.5579324960708618", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Chapter 1 Labeling for Biosimilar Products\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJuly 2018\n\nLabeling\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help applicants develop draft labeling for proposed biosimilar products for submission in an application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262(k)). The recommendations for prescription drug labeling in this guidance pertain only to the prescribing information (commonly referred to as the package insert), except for certain recommendations in section V pertaining to FDA-approved patient labeling (e.g., Patient Information, Medication Guide, and Instructions for Use).2 This guidance does not provide specific labeling recommendations for interchangeable products (see section VIII of this guidance).\n\nFootnote 2: Unless otherwise specified, the terms biosimilar product labeling and labeling as used in this guidance address only the prescribing information as described in 21 CFR 201.56 and 201.57.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Public Law 111-148) on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act amends the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated license pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference product3 (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the Affordable Care Act). Section 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product.\n\nFootnote 3: Reference product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSection 351(i) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean \"that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\"\n\nTo meet the standard for interchangeability, an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from:\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nUnder the PHS Act, FDA has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.\n\nUnder FDA regulations, prescription drug labeling must provide adequate information to enable health care providers to \"use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended\"; and to this end, the approved prescribing information summarizes the essential scientific information needed by health care providers for the safe and effective use of a drug.4 Prescription drug labeling reflects FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness5({}^{,})6 for the drug under the labeled conditions of use and facilitates prescribing decisions, thereby enabling the safe and effective use of drugs, including biological products, and reducing the likelihood of medication errors.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.43791210651397705", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: VI Relationship of Agreed Initial Psp to the Requirement to Submit a Pediatric Study Plan with an Application\n\nFor NDAs, BLAs, or supplemental applications subject to PREA, sponsors must include an agreed iPSP in the application when a deferral of pediatric studies is requested.54 In such cases, submission of the iPSP (specifically, the agreed iPSP) fulfills the requirement of the sponsor to submit a pediatric study plan, which must be included in the appropriate section of the application.55 Failure to fulfill the requirement to submit a pediatric study plan with the application may be grounds for refusal to file an application.56 Any planned requests for waivers and/or deferrals included in the iPSP serve as the official request with the application submission.57 The PeRC will review any requests for waivers and/or deferrals and make recommendations as needed to the review division.58 A final decision about granting or denying such requests is made by the review division at the time of approval of the marketing application.\n\nFootnote 54: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 505B(a)(1) and 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 355c(a)(1), and 355c(e).\n\nFootnote 55: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and 505B(e)(3) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and 355c(e)(3).\n\nVII Content and Timing of Requested Amendment to an Initial Psp\n\nSponsors can request an amendment to an agreed iPSP at any time. Requests can include, for example, changing a date listed in section 11 of the iPSP that would significantly delay the initiation and/or completion of pediatric studies (e.g., by more than 12 months), changing planned requests for a deferral to planned requests for a waiver or partial waiver, or changing a planned request for a waiver or partial waiver to a planned request for a deferral. For example, emerging safety data from nonclinical juvenile animal studies and/or adult human clinical trials may support converting a planned request for a deferral to a planned request for a waiver for reasons of safety. Alternatively, the need for additional safety data from adult human clinical trials may support a delay in the initiation of pediatric clinical trials. In addition, formulation data could necessitate a change in a development program. The PeRC will be consulted on the review of significant amendments to an agreed iPSP.59\n\nFootnote 59: See section 505B(e)(6) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(6).\n\nA request for an amendment to an agreed iPSP should include the following:\n\nThe requested change(s) supported with a justification\n\nA copy of the agreed iPSP with the requested change(s) tracked and clearly identified\n\nA clean copy of the proposed amended iPSP\n\nAmendments should not be considered agreed upon until the FDA issues a letter stating that the amendments are acceptable.\n\nOnce the FDA accepts for filing an application or supplemental application, it is not necessary to submit amendments to the iPSP because changes to the plan for pediatric development can be negotiated during the review cycle as appropriate. For example, a sponsor submits a marketing application with an agreed iPSP, and the review division files the application. The sponsor proposes to modify the timeline for studies after filing the application; in this case, it is not necessary to submit an amended iPSP, but instead the newly proposed timeline can be negotiated with the review division during the review cycle of the application.\n\nThe timeline for submission, review, and agreement on an amended iPSP is the same as on an iPSP.60 (See Section IV., Timing of an Initial PSP Submission). If the FDA does not agree to the amended iPSP, the original agreed iPSP remains in force. If the sponsor submits an amendment to an agreed iPSP within 210 days of the planned submission of an NDA, BLA, or supplement, the amendment may not be considered agreed absent sufficient time for the FDA review. However, the sponsor may submit the NDA, BLA, or supplement with the previously agreed iPSP. FDA intends to, as appropriate, consider changes to the plan for pediatric development during the application review cycle (see section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs).\n\nFootnote 60: See section 505B(e)(5) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(5).\n\nHowever, if, under certain situations, the agreed iPSP included nonclinical and/or pediatric clinical studies that were expected to have been completed before submission of the NDA, BLA, or supplement, failure of the sponsor to complete these agreed studies in a timely manner may result in a refusal to file.61 In this situation, a sponsor should submit a request for an amendment to the agreed iPSP that includes an updated timeline for the studies and justification for the delay in completing one or more of the agreed pediatric studies. If the FDA considers the justification for the delay to be inadequate and does not agree with the proposed iPSP amendment, the agreed iPSP would remain in force until the FDA and sponsor agree on an amended iPSP (See Section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs), and the failure of the sponsor to complete the agreed nonclinical and/or pediatric clinical studies in a timely manner still may result in a refusal to file.\n\nFootnote 61: See section 505B(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(1)), which requires that the assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation be submitted with the application or supplement to which PREA applies. See also 21 CFR 314.101(d).\n\nVIII Non-Agreed Initial PSPs\n\nIf the FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach agreement on an iPSP at the end of the 210-day review period, the FDA intends to issue a letter stating that the iPSP is considered a non-agreed iPSP. As discussed in section IX., Reaching Agreement on the Non-Agreed Initial PSP, there is no established timeline for the review and agreement of a non-agreed iPSP. Therefore, sponsors are encouraged to work with FDA to reach agreement during the initial 210-day review period.\n\nIf the FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach agreement on the proposed amendments to an agreed iPSP, the FDA intends to issue a letter stating that the amended iPSP is considered a non-agreed amended iPSP. Under this circumstance, the agreed iPSP would be considered to be in force until the FDA and sponsor agree on an amended iPSP.\n\nAs stated above, for NDAs, BLAs, or supplemental applications subject to PREA, sponsors must include an agreed iPSP in the application when a deferral of pediatric studies is requested, and the failure to submit an agreed iPSP when a deferral is requested may be grounds for refusal to file the application.62 All correspondence with the FDA regarding any non-agreed amendments should be included in the appropriate section of the application.\n\nFootnote 62: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 505B(a)(1), and 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 355c(a)(1), and 355c(e). See also 21 CFR 314.101(d).\n\nIX Reaching Agreement on the Non-Agreed Initial Psp\n\nWhen a sponsor receives a letter of nonagreement, the FDA makes every effort to work with the sponsor and resolve the area(s) of disagreement as quickly as possible; however, no statutory timeline is attached to this process. If the sponsor disagrees with the FDA's recommendations, the sponsor can request a meeting with the FDA. After the sponsor and the FDA have resolved any disagreements, the sponsor should submit the proposed agreed iPSP for FDA review.\n\nAppendix: Initial pediatrictic study plan template1\n\nFootnote 1: This template is also available at https://www.fda.gov/media/84944/download.\n\nWhen submitting an initial pediatrictic study plan (iPSP), sponsors should mark the submission \"INITIAL pediatrictic STUDY PLAN\" in large, bolded type at the beginning of the title page. For an agreed iPSP or amended iPSP, sponsors should mark the submission \"PROPOSED AGREED PEDIATRIC STUDY PLAN\" or \"AMENDED PEDIATRIC STUDY PLAN,\" respectively, in large, bolded type at the beginning of the title page.\n\nINITIAL pediatrictic STUDY PLAN TITLE PAGE\n\nThe proprietary name and the established name of the drug, if any, or, for biological products, the proper name including any appropriate descriptors\n\nDosage form:\n\nNDA/BLA/IND (#):\n\nDrug class:\n\nApproved indication (if applicable):\n\nProposed indication (if applicable):\n\nProposed General Plan: (i.e., full or partial waiver, deferral, and inclusion of a pediatric assessment or molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation in the future application)\n\nCross-reference to other investigational new drug applications for which an iPSP is submitted for this drug development program\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE DISEASE/CONDITION IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION (1-3 pages)\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE DRUG OR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (1-3 pages)\n\nOVERVIEW OF PLANNED EXTRAPOLATION TO SPECIFIC PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS (1-3 pages)\n\nPLANNED REQUEST FOR DRUG-SPECIFIC WAIVER(S) (1-3 pages)\n\nPLANNED REQUEST FOR DEEFRAL(S) OF PEDIATRIC STUDIES (1-2 pages)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTABULAR SUMMARY OF PLANNED NONCLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nAGE-APPROPRIATE FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT (1-3 pages)\n\nNONCLINICAL STUDIES (1-3 pages)\n\nCLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT DESIGN AND/OR INITITATION OF STUDIES IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (1-5 pages)\n\nPLANNED PEDIATRIC CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n1 Pediatric Pharmacokinetic or Pharmacokine/Pharmacodynamic Studies (1-10 pages)\n\n2 Clinical Effectiveness and Safety Studies (1-10 pages)\n\nTIMELINE OF THE PEDIATRIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1 page)\n\nAGREEMENTS FOR PEDIATRIC STUDIES WITH OTHER REGULATORY AuthorITIES (1-3 pages)\n\nIf there is a pending or agreed pediatric investigational plan with EMA (European Medicines Agency), sponsors should provide the corresponding application number (e.g., EMEA-000206-PIP01-08).\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.17980723083019257", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule \u201cRequirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products\u201d (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule \u201cContent and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling\u201d (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095\u201396).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.495973587036133", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Section 505B(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires that all original new drug applications (NDAs) or biologics license applications (BLAs) for a new active ingredient that are submitted on or after August 18, 2020, must \u201csubmit with the application reports on the investigation described in paragraph (3) if the drug or biological product that is the subject of the application is- (i) intended for the treatment of an adult cancer; and (ii) directed at a molecular target that the [FDA] determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.\u201d Section 505B(a)(1) of the FD&C Act also requires NDAs and BLAs (or supplements to applications) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration to contain a pediatric assessment unless the requirement is waived or deferred.\n\nTo ensure the prospect for direct clinical benefit from participation on a research study where there is a greater than minor increase over minimal risk, sponsors generally should enroll pediatric subjects in dose-finding and activity estimating cohorts only after a reasonably safe dose and preliminary activity have been established in adults. In exceptional circumstances, substantive nonclinical evidence of activity in tumor-derived cell lines or patient-derived xenografts alone may provide sufficient justification for enrollment of a pediatric cohort before the availability of full clinical data in adult subjects. In these situations, FDA recommends that sponsors consider staggered enrollment of older children or adolescents before younger children to minimize risk.\n\nInformation to support expansion cohorts for pediatric subjects should include detailed toxicity monitoring plans, plans for PK assessment, and, when appropriate, pharmacodynamic study objectives to guide further pediatric development. For targeted drugs, confirmation of the putative target's presence should be documented, and eligibility should be limited to pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory disease for whom no satisfactory alternative therapy exists. Consideration of an orally administered drug's formulation, especially for younger children who may be unable to swallow capsules or tablets, may require development of an age-appropriate formulation for investigational use.23\n\nFootnote 23: See FD&C Act section 505B(a)(2).\n\nIn general, further development of the drug for one or more pediatric cancer-specific indications should be pursued as a separate protocol. Initial evaluation of a drug in the pediatric population as part of an expansion cohort should be included in the pediatric study plan.\n\nStatistical Considerations\n\nThe background information for each expansion cohort should contain its scientific rationale. Information supporting individual expansion cohorts should describe the prespecified stopping rules for that cohort, based on insufficient antitumor activity or unacceptable level of toxicity for that population. Finally, the analysis plan for each expansion cohort should contain adequate information justifying the planned sample size based on the cohort objectives. For those cohorts evaluating antitumor activity, the plans should specify the magnitude of antitumor activity that would warrant further evaluation of the drug, for example by specifying the precision and power considerations for detection of clinically meaningful antitumor activity. In general, in a nonrandomized cohort, assessment of antitumor activity is determined using a Simon two-stage design or other designs (e.g., Bayesian statistical design) to limit exposure of additional subjects to a potentially ineffective drug.24\n\nFootnote 24: Simon, R, 1989, Optimal Two-Stage Designs for Phase II Clinical Trials, Control Clin Trials, 10(1):1\u201310.\n\nThe trial design for an individual cohort should ensure that the cohort's trial objectives can be met. For example, sponsors should consider the need for randomization within a cohort for comparison of activity between different dosing regimens. In a cohort with a randomized design, the sample size and the inference that can be made will be based on the prespecified null and alternative hypotheses to be tested, the level of significance, and the power of the test.\n\nSponsors should avoid comparisons between cohorts to which subjects were not randomly assigned.\n\nVII Safety Considerations\n\nSafety Monitoring and Reporting Plans\n\nThe sponsor is required to ensure proper monitoring of the investigations and to ensure that the investigations are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND, among other responsibilities.25\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 312.50. See also the guidance for industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations \u2014 A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring (August 2013).\n\nThe sponsor should establish a systematic approach, including plans for activation of protocol amendments, to address serious safety issues and to ensure rapid communication of serious safety issues. This approach should be described in the protocol or its appendices.267\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe IND should contain a proposed plan for submission of a cumulative summary of safety data and information, on a periodic basis that is more frequent than annual.27 The plan should be discussed with the review division at the pre-IND meeting. The recommended frequency of the submissions will be dependent on specific program risks and the rapidity of subject accrual. New safety data that further identify, characterize, and provide insight on management of adverse reactions should be periodically assessed and submitted to the IND in support of modifications of one or more cohorts within the protocol.\n\nFootnote 27: See also 21 CFR 312.33 (for information on requirements for submitting IND safety reports).\n\nThe interval for submission of cumulative safety reports should be agreed upon with FDA. The most recent cumulative safety report should be referenced in support of protocol amendments proposing modifications of existing or new expansion cohorts. Given the complexity of these trials and potential increased risks to subjects, sponsors should select medical monitors who have training and experience in cancer treatment and clinical trial conduct.\n\nAppendix B Independent Data Monitoring Committee\n\nAn independent data monitoring committee (IDMC)28 or other appropriate independent entity structured to assess safety in addition to efficacy should be established for all FIH multiple expansion cohort protocols, given that the complexity of these trials (with regard to different cohort objectives, trial populations, and dosages evaluated simultaneously) can lead to potential increased risks to subjects.\n\nFootnote 28: See the guidance for clinical trial sponsors Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committee (March 2006).\n\nResposibilities of the IDMC should include, but not be limited to, analysis of incoming expedited safety reports, review of cumulative summaries of all adverse events, and making recommendations to the IND sponsor regarding protocol modifications to reduce risks to subjects enrolled in the trial. The IDMC should be charged with the real-time review of all serious adverse events29 and meet periodically to assess the totality of safety information in the development program. The IDMC should be responsible for performing prespecified and ad hoc assessments of safety and futility for each cohort, to recommend protocol modifications, or other actions including, but not limited to, the following:\n\nFootnote 29: 21 CFR 312.32 (for information on IND safety reporting requirements related to serious adverse events).\n\nChanging the eligibility criteria if the risks of the intervention seem to be higher in a subgroup\n\nAltering the drug product dosage and/or schedule if the adverse events observed appear likely to be reduced by such changes\n\nModifying monitoring plans for safety by the addition of more frequent or new types of assessments\n\n3.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIdentifying information needed to inform current and future trial subjects of newly identified risks via changes in the informed consent document and, in some cases, obtaining reconsent of current subjects to continued trial participation\n\nIn trials of limited sample size (no more than 90 subjects in the dose-finding portion and no more than 200 subjects across all dose-expansion cohorts), sponsors may wish to consider a safety assessment committee that is a group within the sponsor's organization alone or with external representation. If a safety assessment is performed within the sponsor's organization, a firewall should be established to ensure that the individuals performing those assessments are not otherwise involved in trial conduct or management to protect the integrity of the study.\n\nIRB/Independent Ethics Committee\n\nUnder FDA's regulations, a clinical investigation generally may not be initiated until it has been reviewed and approved by an IRB/independent ethics committee, and it remains subject to continuing review by an IRB throughout the duration of the trial.30 Consistent with the continuing review requirements,31 the investigator should provide cumulative safety information provided by the IND sponsor to the IRB.\n\nFootnote 30: 21 CFR 56.103(a); 21 CFR 56.109(f).\n--------------------\nContext title: Expansion Cohorts- Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8288028240203857"], "In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: A formal evaluation of benefit is a new feature of the PBRER; however, it is recognised that a concise discussion of benefit will usually be sufficient, unless the safety or benefit-risk profile has changed significantly during the reporting interval. Thus, the level of detail provided in certain sections of the PBRER (e.g., evaluation of safety and efficacy data, evaluation of safety signals,* and benefit-risk evaluation) should be proportional to the medicinal product's known or emerging important risks and to evidence of emerging important benefits.\n\nAs the scope of the PBRER has been extended to include benefit as well as safety, the reference information for the report also needs to take this new factor into account. It is generally impractical for Marketing Authorisation Holders (MAHs) to have one reference information source that:\n\nEncompasses all parameters that contribute towards the benefit-risk evaluation, (i.e., benefit, efficacy/effectiveness, indication(s) and safety information);\n\nIs common to all ICH regions; and\n\nAddresses all circumstances, (e.g., generics, products licensed in one country only).\n\nTherefore, this Guideline proposes more practical options that MAHs can consider in selecting the most appropriate reference product information for the PBRER. These proposals incorporate the original ICH E2C concept of reference safety information (e.g., Company Core Safety Information [CCSI]), with the addition of the approved indications for the product. This reference product information may be the Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS) or another document proposed by the MAH (see Section 2.4).\n\nThe important baseline efficacy and effectiveness information summarised in Section 17.1 of the PBRER will form the basis (or \"reference\") for the benefit evaluation, irrespective of the reference product information used by the MAH.\n\nThe frequency of submission of reports to regulatory authorities is subject to national or regional regulatory requirements, and may differ, depending on a number of factors. The Guideline includes advice on managing different frequencies of PBRER submission in different regions.\n\nOne of the motivating factors behind revision of the ICH E2C(R1) Guideline was the desire to enhance efficiency by decreasing the duplication of effort required for the preparation of various regulatory documents. This Guideline has been developed, therefore, such that corresponding sections of the PBRER, Development Safety Update Report (DSUR, ICH E2F), and safety specification of a risk management plan (ICH E2E) can be identical in content.

This approach is applicable to those sections of the PBRER in which there is evaluation of safety data, efficacy/effectiveness data, safety signals, and benefit-risk. Therefore, the extent of information provided in such PBRER sections will vary among individual PBRERs.\n\nFor example, when there is important new safety information, a detailed presentation of that information should be included, plus the relevant benefit information, in order to facilitate a robust benefit-risk analysis. Conversely, when little new important safety information has become available during the reporting interval, a concise summary of baseline benefit information should be sufficient, and the benefit-risk evaluation would consist primarily of an evaluation of updated interval safety data.\n\nEfficacy/Effectiveness\n\nFor the purpose of this Guideline, evidence on benefits in clinical trials and in everyday medical practice should be reported. Because the terms are not harmonized across regions, the terms \"efficacy/effectiveness\" are used in this Guideline to clarify that information from both clinical trials and everyday medical practice are within the scope of the information on benefit to be included within the PBRER. In some regions, efficacy refers to evidence of benefit from controlled clinical trials while effectiveness implies use in everyday medical practice. Conversely, in other regions, this distinction is not made.\n\nBenefit-Risk Evaluation\n\nWhen a drug is approved for marketing, a conclusion has been reached that, when used in accordance with approved product information, its benefits outweigh its risks. As new information about the drug emerges during marketing experience, benefit-risk evaluation should be carried out to determine whether benefits continue to outweigh risks, and to consider whether steps need to be taken to improve the benefit-risk balance through risk minimisation activities, e.g., labelling changes, communications with prescribers, or other steps.\n\nPeriodicity and PBRER Data Lock Point\n\n2.8.1 International Birth Date and Data Lock Point\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.494058609008789", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: One of the motivating factors behind revision of the ICH E2C(R1) Guideline was the desire to enhance efficiency by decreasing the duplication of effort required for the preparation of various regulatory documents.

The PBRER should contain an evaluation of new information relevant to the medicinal product that became available to the MAH during the reporting interval, in the context of cumulative information by:\n\nSummarising relevant new safety information that could have an impact on the benefit-risk profile of the medicinal product;\n\nSummarising any important new efficacy/effectiveness information that has become available during the reporting interval;* Examining whether the information obtained by the MAH during the reporting interval is in accord with previous knowledge of the medicinal product's benefit and risk profile; and\n\nWhere important new safety information has emerged, conducting an integrated benefit-risk evaluation for approved indications.\n\nWhen appropriate, the PBRER should include proposed action(s) to optimise the benefit-risk profile.\n\nUrgent safety information should be reported through the appropriate mechanism; the PBRER is not intended to be used to provide initial notification of significant new safety information or to provide the means by which new safety concerns* are detected.\n\nScope of the PBRER\n\nThe main focus of each PBRER is the evaluation of relevant new safety information from the available data sources,2placed within the context of any pertinent efficacy/effectiveness information that may have become available since the International Birth Date* (IBD), the date of the first marketing approval in any country in the world, or the Development International Birth Date (DIBD), the date of first authorisation for the conduct of an interventional clinical trial in any country.3 All pertinent new safety and efficacy/effectiveness information discovered during the reporting interval3 should be discussed in the appropriate sections of the PBRER.\n\nFootnote 2: For the purpose of this document, the terms \u201cauthorisation\u201d and \u201cauthorised\u201d refer to clinical trials and the terms \u201capproval\u201d and \u201capproved\u201d refer to marketing applications.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.2173736095428467", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: Providing Postmarketing Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) Guidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nNovember 2016\n\nDrug SafetyProviding Postmarketing Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) Guidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{\\text{th}}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: occod@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nNovember 2016\n\nDrug Safety\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Postmarketing Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) Guidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes the conditions under which applicants2 can use an alternative reporting format, the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)3 E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), in place of the U.S. periodic adverse drug experience report (PADER), U.S. periodic adverse experience report (PAER), or ICH E2C Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), to satisfy the periodic postmarketing safety reporting requirements in SSS 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2) (21 CFR 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2)). This guidance also describes the procedures applicants should follow if they wish to submit a PBRER in place of a PADER, PAER, or PSUR.4 The steps will differ, depending on whether or not the applicant has an approved waiver in place to substitute the PSUR for the PADER/PAER.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance uses the term applicant to mean the holder of an approved new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or biologics license application (BLA), which are referred to collectively in this guidance as applications.\n\nFootnote 3: Formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products for human use among regulators around the world (for more information about the ICH and the procedures for adopting harmonized guidelines, see http://www.ich.org/). Guidelines that have been formally endorsed by the ICH are implemented by the FDA in the form of FDA guidance documents whose development follows the procedures outlined in FDA\u2019s good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115).\n\nFootnote 4: FDA accepts all three formats, the PADER/PAER, PSUR, and PBRER, to fulfill the postmarketing periodic safety reporting requirements under \u00a7s 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2). Each format must be submitted according to the content and timelines specified in the regulations (PADER/PAER) or by ICH (PSUR and PBRER).\n\nII Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes the conditions under which applicants2 can use an alternative reporting format, the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)3 E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), in place of the U.S. periodic adverse drug experience report (PADER), U.S. periodic adverse experience report (PAER), or ICH E2C Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), to satisfy the periodic postmarketing safety reporting requirements in SSS 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2) (21 CFR 314.80(c)(2) and 600.80(c)(2)). This guidance also describes the procedures applicants should follow if they wish to submit a PBRER in place of a PADER, PAER, or PSUR.4 The steps will differ, depending on whether or not the applicant has an approved waiver in place to substitute the PSUR for the PADER/PAER.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n600.80(c)(2)(ii)(A)(3), along with a copy of the U.S. labeling in effect on the data lock point (DLP)14 date.\n\nFootnote 14: The term data lock point refers to the date designated as the cut-off for data to be included in the PSUR or PBRER.\n\nFDA has routinely granted waivers to permit applicants to change the date of the DLP from the U.S. approval date, as required under SSS 314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i), to a different date for harmonization purposes. These waivers have been granted on the condition that the applicant ensures that there are no gaps in reporting resulting from the date change. FDA has also permitted applicants to include multiple products with the same active moiety or active ingredient in a single report as recommended in the ICH E2C(R1) guidance.\n\nGenerally, FDA has not waived the reporting frequencies required under SSS 314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i). However, FDA has permitted applicants to submit PSURs at longer intervals, consistent with the ICH guidelines, on the condition that the applicant submit a periodic safety report as needed to fulfill the reporting frequency requirements.\n\nExample: FDA granted an applicant a waiver to submit a PSUR for its drug product every 3 years. FDA granted this waiver on the condition that the applicant also submit an annual PADER for years 1 and 2 of the 3-year PSUR cycle.\n\n3 Procedures Applicants Should Follow to Submit a PBRER\n\nApplicants With a PSUR Waiver\n\nIf applicants already have a PSUR waiver for an approved application, FDA will consider the existing PSUR waiver to permit applicants to submit a PBRER instead of a PSUR under the conditions described below, because the PBRER replaces the PSUR for postmarketing periodic safety reporting. If applicants wish to substitute the PBRER for the PSUR with no changes in the DLP or frequency of reporting, applicants can do so without submitting a new waiver request. However, if applicants wish to change any conditions of their PSUR waiver other than the format, applicants should submit either a notification or new waiver request, depending on the circumstances described below.\n\n3.1.1 Change in the Date of the DLP for the PBRER - Submit Notification\n\nIf applicants wish to use a DLP date for the PBRER that is different than the DLP date used for the PSUR, applicants should ensure there are no gaps in reporting intervals resulting from the change in DLP. Examples of appropriate alternatives include the following:\n\nSubmit overlapping reports to cover the gap.\n\nSubmit a one-time PADER/PAER to cover the gap.\n\nExtend the reporting interval of the applicant's upcoming PADER/PAER by up to 3 months to cover the gap.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants should submit written notification to the application(s), indicating the change in DLP date and describing the measures taken to ensure that there are no resulting gaps in reporting.\n\nLonger PBRER Reporting Intervals But No Change in Frequency - Submit Notification\n\nIf applicants wish to submit the PBRER less frequently than is permitted under their PSUR waiver, the continued validity of the applicant's waiver will be conditioned on the applicant's submission of a PADER/PAER as needed to fulfill the reporting frequency requirement under our regulations.\n\nApplicants should submit written notification to the application, indicating this change and describing the measures taken to ensure that the periodicity requirements are being met.\n\nIf the applicant's PSUR waiver specifies annual PSUR submission but the applicant wishes to submit a PBRER every 3 years, the applicant can substitute the PBRER for the PSUR, provided the applicant submits a PADER/PAER for years 1 and 2 of the 3-year PBRER cycle to maintain the annual reporting frequency required under the regulations and as specified in its PSUR waiver.\n\nOther Changes to the PSUR Waiver - Submit New Waiver\n\nIf applicants wish to change any other condition of their PSUR waiver beyond what is described in sections III.A.1 and III.A.2 above, then applicants should submit a new waiver request. For example, a new waiver request should be submitted to change the overall reporting frequency or to add or remove products covered by the report.\n\nAppendix B Applicants Without a PSUR Waiver\n--------------------\nContext title: Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.2147489786148071", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) described in this Guideline is intended to be a common standard for periodic benefit-risk evaluation reporting on marketed products (including approved drugs that are under further study) among the ICH regions.\n\nThis Guideline defines the recommended format and content of a PBRER and provides an outline of points to be considered in its preparation and submission.\n\nDefinitions of many technical terms used in the Guideline are included in a glossary (Appendix A); the first mention of a term in the Guideline is identified with an asterisk (*).\n\nBackground\n\nWhen a new medicinal product is approved for marketing, demonstration of safety and efficacy are generally based on data from a limited number of patients, many studied under the controlled conditions of randomised trials. Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.606204092502594"], "This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Assay Migration Studies for\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostic Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA\n\nStaff\n\nDocument issued on: April 25, 2013\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on January 5, 2009.\n\nFor questions regarding this document contact Sally Hojvat, PhD, CDRH/OIR/DMD, by phone at (301) 796-5455, or by email at sally.hojvat@fda.hhs.gov or Marina V.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA's regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term \"new system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term \"old system\" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA's Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.2322537899017334", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies -Frequently Asked Questions\n\nDocument issued on: June 25, 2010\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on October 25, 2007.\n\nThis document supersedes \"Guidance for FDA Staff: Regulating In Vitro Diagnostic Device (IVD) Studies,\" issued December 17, 1999.\n\nFor questions regarding this document, contact Sally Hojvat, Ph.D. in CDRH at 301-796-5455 or the Office of Communication, Outreach and Development in CBER at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nAdditional Copies\n\nAdditional copies are available from the Internet at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm071230.pdf.\n\nOr, contact:\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development, HFM-40\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852-1448\n\nInternet:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/default/\n\nt.htm\n\nTel: 800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\nThis guidance document outlines FDA regulations applicable to studies for investigational IVD devices, including those regulations related to human subject protection.

The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Introduction\n\n1. What is the purpose of this guidance document and how does it differ from other guidance documents related to IVD products?\n\nFDA prepared this comprehensive document as a resource for you and for its own staff to address issues concerning IVD studies. This guidance document contains information relevant to studies conducted during the development of a new IVD product, as well as other general considerations about applicable requirements and marketing of the new device. It addresses particularly those investigational studies that are exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR Part 812. IVD study investigators and members of IRBs who review and approve such studiesmay also find it helpful. There are also device-specific guidance documents available for specific IVD products that can be found at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfggp/search.cfm. The use of\n\ninvestigational IVD devices in clinical studies designed to evaluate new drug products falls outside the scope of this guidance.\n\n2 Why are in vitro diagnostics considered devices?\n\nIn vitro diagnostics (IVDs) meet the definition of a device under the Act. Section 201(h) of the Act defines a device as:\n\n\"an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is--\n\n(1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United\n\nStates Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,\n\n(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions,\n\nor in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in\n\nman or other animals, or\n\n(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of\n\nman or other animals, and\n\nwhich does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical\n\naction within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not\n\ndependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary\n\nintended purposes.\" 21 U.S.C. 321(h) (emphasis added).\n\n3 How do IVD devices differ from other devices?\n\nMost other devices function on or in a patient. In contrast, IVDs include products\n\nused to collect specimens, or to prepare or examine specimens (e.g., blood, serum, urine, spinal fluid, tissue samples) after they are removed from the human body.\n\n4 Which Divisions at FDA are responsible for review of IVD products?\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Chemistry and Toxicology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5470\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Immunology and Hematology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5481\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Microbiology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5461\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Cell, Tissues, and Gene Therapy (OCTGT) - Phone: (301) 827-5102\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Blood Applications (DBA) - Phone: (301) 827-3524DBA schedules all review-related meetings for OBRR\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Emerging and Transfusion Transmitted Diseases\n\n(DETTD) - Phone: (301) 827-3008\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Hematology (DH) - Phone: (301) 496-4396\n\n5.

General Regulatory Issues\n\n1. Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information.

How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6181704998016357", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: 1. Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information. This is not an all-inclusive list.\n\nTitle 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR)\n\nPart 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures\n\nPart 50, Protection of Human SubjectsPart 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\n\nPart 56, Institutional Review Boards\n\nPart 801, Labeling\n\nPart 803, Medical Device Reporting\n\nPart 807, Establishment Registration and Device Listing for\n\nManufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices\n\nPart 809, In Vitro Diagnostic Products for Human Use\n\nPart 810, Medical Device Recall Authority\n\nPart 812, Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nPart 814, Premarket Approval of Medical Devices\n\nPart 820, Quality System Regulation\n\nPart 860, Medical Device Classification Procedures\n\nPart 862, Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices\n\nPart 864, Hematology and Pathology Devices\n\nPart 866, Immunology and Microbiology Devices\n\nIn addition, certain sections of Part 610 apply to devices that employ\n\nhuman blood components. For example:\n\n610.40, Test Requirements (Testing Requirements for Communicable\n\nDisease Agents)\n\n610.42, Restrictions on Use for Further Manufacture of Medical Devices\n\n2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n\nb. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been\n\nfound to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is\n\nused or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed\n\nby FDA in determining substantial equivalence.\n\nc. The IVD\n\n({}^{\\star}) is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c);\n\n({}^{\\star}) is noninvasive (see question #5 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents\n\nsignificant risk (see question #4 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject;\n\nand(\\bullet) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure (see question # 6 below).\n\nFor your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation under this third category, it must meet all of the conditions listed in \"c\" above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled \"Disqualification of a clinical investigator.\")\n\nIf your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)\n\nThe requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study presents to subjects.\n\nFor a significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a non-significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board (IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the abbreviated requirements are met.\n\nNote: The requirements of the \"Protection of Human Subjects\" and \"Institutional Review Boards\" regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101; see also Section V, Human Subject Protection, of this guidance.) Therefore, all studies of investigational IVDs that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, even if they are not subject to most requirements of 21 CFR Part 812.\n\n3. How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study under 21 CFR 812.2(b)?A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m).\n\nFor IVDs, we interpret \"potential for serious risk\" in relation to the nature of the harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.\n\nFalse positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of infectious agents to others. If the potential risk does not rise to the level described above, the study is not considered to pose a significant risk. FDA recommends the sponsor consider all these factors when determining the risk associated with your investigational IVD. (See 21 CFR 812.3(m) and also \"Information Sheet Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors,\" available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida\n\nncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm113709.htm, particularly the one on\n\n\"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Devices\" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm126622.htm.)\n\nHow do I determine if an invasive sampling technique presents a significant risk under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)?\n\nTo determine whether an invasive sampling technique presents a serious risk, we recommend that you base your risk determination on the nature of the harm that may result from sampling. For example, FDA considers sampling techniques that require biopsy of a major organ, use of general anesthesia, or placement of a blood access line into an artery or large vein (subclavian, femoral, or iliac) to present a significant risk.\n\n5 What does noninvasive mean?\n\nA noninvasive device is one that does not, by design or intention:\n\na. penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the ocular cavity, or the urethra; or b. enter the ear beyond the external auditory canal, the nose beyond the nares, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond the rectum, or the vagina beyond the cervical os.\n\n(21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\nBlood sampling that involves simple venipuncture is considered noninvasive, and the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are left over from samples taken for noninvestigational purposes is also considered noninvasive (21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\n6. What does it mean to have \"confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure?\"\n\nFor an investigational study to be exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), clinical investigators must use a medically established means of diagnosis (e.g., another cleared or approved IVD or culture) of the disease or condition as the basis for decisions regarding treatment of all subjects participating in the study. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)(iv). Additionally, test results from the exempt IVD investigation should not influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions before the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure.\n\nIf an investigational test uses a new technology or represents a significant technological advance, established diagnostic products or procedures may not be adequate to confirm the diagnosis provided by the investigational IVD. For example, if an investigational test is designed to identify an infection at the earliest stages of viral infection (before formation of antibodies), established diagnostic products or procedures that rely on the detection of antibodies to the virus would be inadequate to confirm diagnoses. Under these conditions the study would not meet the criteria for exemption under 812.2(c)(3) since the testing could not be confirmed with a medically established diagnostic product or procedure. You may consider whether the device is a non-significant risk device subject to abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\n7. What if no medically established means for diagnosing the disease or condition exists?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1731655597686768", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Study - as used in this document, covers the systematic evaluations conducted in the development of an IVD product, including the feasibility, analytical assessments, method comparison, and evaluations to determine clinical utility of a product.\n\nSubject - a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used or as a control. A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nSurplus samples - see excess samples.\n\nTransitional device - a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)).\n\nTreatment IDE - use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions regulation at 21 CFR 812.36.\n\nTruth Standard (\"Gold\" Standard) - any medical procedure or laboratory method or combination of procedures and methods that the clinical community relies upon for diagnosis, that is accepted by FDA, and that is regarded as having negligible risk of either a false positive or a false negative result. The truth standard result should be definitive (positive/negative, present/absent, or diseased/non-diseased), and should not give an indeterminate result. As science and technology improve, newer, more reliable standards may replace previous standards, particularly in the case of new disease markers.\n\nVIII.

We summarize them below.\n\n1. General Duties (21 CFR 812.40)\n\na. Submitting the IDE application to FDA\n\nb. Obtaining both FDA and IRB approval for the investigation\n\nc. Selecting qualified investigators and providing them with the information they need to conduct the investigation\n\nproperly\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.246051549911499", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4)(i); 21 CFR 56.103(a); 21 CFR 50.24\n\n(See also Question 10.)\n\nMay studies involving in vitro diagnostic devices be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nYes. An in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) study may be conducted provided that it meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50.24. IVD studies falling within the scope of section 50.24 would include, for example, studies in which diagnosis of a life-threatening condition cannot be confirmed by an approved product or well-established procedure (e.g., research involving an investigational test for a neurotoxin that when inhaled or in contact with skin, can cause patients to become sick within minutes, and at high doses, to lose consciousness, develop seizures and die). The regulation's use of language usually associated with therapeutic products does not exclude IVDs because the administration of therapy in a life-threatening situation can depend upon a diagnostic intervention. Sponsors should contact FDA if they have questions as to whether a particular IVD study may be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24.\n\nWill FDA accept data from emergency research studies conducted at non-US sites?\n\nYes, provided appropriate regulatory requirements are satisfied. For drug/biological drug studies, if the non-U.S. sites are under an IND, all 21 CFR 50.24 requirements must be met, as well as other provisions of 21 CFR Part 312.\n\nIf the sites operate as non-IND sites, but the data are included in a marketing application, then 21 CFR 312.120 would apply. 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i) \"does not require informed consent in life-threatening situations when the [International Ethics Committee] reviewing the study finds, before initiation of the study, that informed consent is not feasible and either that the conditions present are consistent with those described in SS50.23 or SS50.24(a)...or that the measures described in the study protocol or elsewhere will protect the rights, safety, and well-being of subjects...\" FDA will accept data from non-IND emergency research studies/sites provided the emergency research is conducted in accordance with both internationally accepted standards for good clinical practice (e.g., ICH E6) and applicable national laws.\n\nFor devices, under 21 CFR 814.15(b), FDA will accept foreign studies submitted in support of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application if the data are valid and the investigator has conducted the studies in conformance with the \"Declaration of Helsinki\" or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever accords greater protection to the human subjects.\n\nNote that some countries' laws may allow expedited appointment of legally acceptable representatives17 (e.g., judge, independent physician), who can provide consent, removing the need to waive informed consent. (See 21 CFR 312.120 and 814.15 for FDA's requirements for acceptance of data from non-US studies that are not conducted under an IND or IDE, respectively.)\n\nFootnote 17: FDA\u2019s regulations define the term, \u201clegally authorized representative\u201d as \u201can individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject\u2019s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research.\u201d ICH E6 defines the term \u201clegally acceptable representative\u201d in almost identical language. See ICH E6, 1.37\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073122.pdf).\n\n19. Must studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 be registered?\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA)18, Title VIII, Section 801 mandates that a \"responsible party\" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register an applicable clinical trial in the registry database, Clinicaltrials.gov,19 and defines an \"applicable clinical trial.\"20 In addition, the statute describes the responsible party's obligation to report results of certain \"applicable clinical trials.\"21 Results must be reported if the trial conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 meets the criteria for an \"applicable clinical trial\" as described at ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nFootnote 18: U.S. Public Law 110-85\n\nFootnote 19: http://clinicaltrials.gov\n\nFootnote 20: http://grants.nih.gov/ClinicalTrials fdaaa/definitions.htm\n\nII. Qualifications for a study to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24\n\n20. What conditions must be present for a study to be eligible to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nAll of the following conditions must be present:\n\nThe human subjects are in a life-threatening situation that necessitates urgent intervention;\n\nAvailable treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory (See also Questions 23, 24, and 25);\n\nCollection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of the intervention;\n\nObtaining informed consent is not feasible because the subjects are not able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe intervention must be administered before consent can be obtained from the subject's legally authorized representative;\n\nThere is no reasonable way to identify prospectively individuals likely to become eligible for participation;\n\nParticipation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects (See also Question 21); and\n\nThe clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver (See also Question 29).\n\n(See Appendix A for the complete text of 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\n2.2.2 What is meant by \"prospect of direct benefit\"?\n\nThe information from animal and preclinical studies, other clinical data (e.g., use of the product in another setting or for another diagnosis or in a different study population) or other evidence should support the potential for the investigational product to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects.\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3), the IRB must find and document that participation in an emergency research study holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because\n\n(1) the subjects are in a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;\n\n(2) information from appropriate animal and other preclinical studies support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and\n\n(3) the risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.\n\n2.2.3 Are trials with morbidity endpoints allowed under this regulation?\n\nTrials that have morbidity endpoints (e.g., multiple organ failure free days), rather than mortality endpoints, can meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3) if the study is evaluating severe morbidity that is closely associated with mortality, and therefore clinically relevant. For example, patients with stroke or head injury are at risk of both death and severe disability. A study of an intervention to improve stroke outcome would always consider survival, but could also examine functional status, which might be the primary endpoint of the trial.22 Similarly, a study intended to improve treatment of status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition, might focus on reduced time to seizure control, a benefit likely to affect survival, even if the study itself is not large enough to show improved survival.\n\nFootnote 22: 61 Fed. Reg. 51508 (Comment #38)\n\nFDA recognizes that it may be important to obtain preliminary information on dose tolerability or effect on a critical biomarker (e.g., measurement of brain infarcted area, degree and extent of acidosis) before proceeding to a study that evaluates effectiveness. Considered from the point of view of the individual study subject, the study intervention could hold out the prospect of direct benefit even if the overall study were not large enough to prove this. Such a study would be acceptable only if it could not be done in subjects capable of consenting, and all the other requirements of 21 CFR 50.24 are satisfied. In suchcases, FDA would expect sponsors to provide a clear rationale for conducting these studies in non-consenting subjects.\n\nFDA will consider all proposed morbidity endpoints on a case-by-case basis. Early discussions with the appropriate FDA review divisions are encouraged.\n\nWhat is meant by \"available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory\"?\n\n21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) requires IRBs to document that \"available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory...\" For studies involving drugs, FDA has interpreted the term \"available therapy\" to mean therapy that is specified in the approved labeling of regulated products, with only rare exceptions. For example, a treatment that is not FDA-regulated (e.g., surgery) or a drug that is not labeled for a specific use but which is nevertheless supported by compelling evidence in the medical literature23 may be considered an \"available treatment.\"\n\nFootnote 23: See Guidance for Industry, \u201cAvailable Therapy\u201d\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126637.pdf ) issued July 2004, by CBER and CDER.\n\nFor studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24, sponsors, investigators, and IRBs should consider the following:\n\nWhat is the current \"standard of care\"?\n\nWhat treatments are available?\n\nAre available treatments (including standard of care treatments) \"unproven\"? (See also Question 24)\n\nIf a product is not approved, but widely used, could a study be done to support approval?\n\nAre available treatments unsatisfactory, and if so, how? (See also Question 25)\n\nWhat is meant by \"unproven\"?\n\nIn general, \"unproven\" means that there is not substantial evidence that a treatment is effective for the condition of interest. This may reflect the absence of any data or the absence of studies of acceptable quality. The term \"unproven therapy\" includes:\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5927573442459106", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (4/26/99; 64\n\nFR20312) found at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/042699d.pdf.\n\nAppendix 1: REGULATORY DECISION TREE (21 CFR PART 812) for IVD INVESTIGATIONAL STUDIES\n\nIs it a Pre-amendments device (other than transitional) used according to the labeling in effect at the time, or is it a device, determined by FDA as substantially equivalent (SE) to a preamendments device, used according to the labeling reviewed as part of the SE determination?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} No & \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nIs it a noninvasive device? & Significant risk? & Apply to FDA for IDE \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nDoes the study involve invasive sampling? & Significant risk? & Apply to FDA for IDE \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nWill it be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by a medically established product or procedure?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} No & \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nFollow 21 CFR 812.2(b) - abbreviated IDE requirements\n\nIf the sponsor complies with the applicable requirements of 21 CFR 809.10(c), the study is exempt from 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of 21 CFR 812.119.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:41]\n\n(+) All references in table are to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nWhile investigational IVDs exempt from most of the provisions of 21 CFR Part 812 are not exempt from the QSR requirements, we generally do not intend to enforce such requirements for investigational IVDs that are exempt from most 21 CFR Part 812 requirements; except for design controls.\n\nAppendix 3: Sponsor's Responsibilities for Significant Risk Device Investigations\n\nSponsors are required to comply with all applicable duties under the regulations. We summarize them below.\n\n1. General Duties (21 CFR 812.40)\n\na. Submitting the IDE application to FDA\n\nb. Obtaining both FDA and IRB approval for the investigation\n\nc. Selecting qualified investigators and providing them with the information they need to conduct the investigation\n\nproperly\n\nd. Ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation\n\ne. Ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation\n\n2. Selection of Investigators (21 CFR 812.43)\n\na. Assuring selection of investigators qualified by training and experience\n\nb. Permitting only participating investigators to use the investigational device\n\nc. Obtaining a signed investigator's agreement from each investigator containing:\n\n(1) investigator's curriculum vitate\n\n(2) statement of investigator's relevant experience, including dates, location, extent, and type of experience\n\n(3) if an investigator was involved in an investigation or other research that was terminated, an explanation of the circumstances that led to the termination\n\n(4) statement of the investigator's commitment to:\n\n({}^{\\star}) conduct the investigation in accordance with the agreement, the investigational plan, 21 CFR Part 812\n\nand other applicable regulations, and any conditions of approval imposed by the IRB or FDA\n\n({}^{\\star}) supervise all testing of the device involving human subjects\n\n({}^{\\star}) ensure that the requirements for obtaining informed consent are met (21 CFR Part 50)\n\nd. Selecting monitor(s) qualified by training and experience to monitor the progress of the investigation in accordance with FDA regulations.\n\ne. Providing investigators with the investigational plan and report of prior\n\ninvestigations of the device. (21 CFR 812.45)\n\n3. Monitoring (21 CFR 812.46)a. Securing compliance of all investigators in accordance with the signed investigator's agreement, the investigational plan, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 or other applicable FDA regulations, or any condition of approval imposed by the reviewing IRB or FDA. If compliance cannot be secured, use of the device by the investigator and the investigator's participation in the investigation must be discontinued.\n\nb. Evaluating all unanticipated adverse device effects and terminating the investigation, or portions of it, as soon as possible if that effect presents an unreasonable risk to subjects (Reporting requirements are listed below.)\n\nc. Resuming terminated investigations only after IRB and/or FDA approvals are obtained, as required by this regulation.\n\n4 Controlling Distribution and Disposition of Devices that are Shipped\n\nAlthough investigators are responsible for ensuring that investigational devices are made available only to persons who are legally authorized to receive them (see 21 CFR 812.110(c)), sponsors also bear responsibility for taking proper measures to ensure that devices are not diverted outside of legally authorized channels. Sponsors may ship investigational devices only to qualified investigators participating in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 812.43(b)). Sponsors must also maintain complete, current, and accurate records pertaining to the shipment and disposition of the investigational device (21 CFR 812.140(b)(2)). Records of shipment shall include the name and address of the consignee, type and quantity of device, date of shipment, and batch number or code mark. Records of disposition shall describe the batch number or code marks of any devices returned to the sponsor, repaired, or disposed of in other ways by the investigator or another person, and the reasons for and method of disposal.\n\nTo further ensure compliance with these requirements, sponsors should take appropriate measures to instruct investigators regarding their responsibilities with respect to recordkeeping and device disposition. The specific recordkeeping requirements for investigators are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)).\n\n5. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulation prohibits the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling\n\nc. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and\n\nd. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n\n6. Supplemental Applications (21 CFR 812.35(a) and (b))\n\nSupplemental applications are required to be submitted to, and approved by, FDA in the following situations:\n\na. Changes in the investigational plan: FDA approval is required for any change that may affect the scientific soundness of the investigation or the rights, safety or welfare of the subjects. IRB approval is also required for changes that may affect the rights, safety or welfare of the subjects. The change in the investigational plan may not be implemented until FDA approval (and IRB approval, if required) is obtained.\n\nb. Addition of new institutions: IRB approval is also required for new institutions.\n\nThe investigation at the new institution(s) may not begin until both FDA and IRB approval(s) are obtained, and certification of IRB approval is submitted to FDA.\n\n7. Maintaining Records (21 CFR 812.140(b))\n\nA sponsor shall maintain the following accurate, complete, and current records relating to an investigation (also See Table I, next page):\n\na. Correspondence (including reports) with another sponsor, monitor, investigators, an IRB or FDA\n\nb. Records of any shipment, including:\n\n(1) name and address of consignee\n\n(2) type and quantity of device(3) date of shipment\n\n(4) batch numbers or code marks\n\n(5) Records of disposition, describing:\n\n(1) Batch number or code mark of devices returned, repaired, or disposed of by the investigator or other persons,\n\n(2) Reasons for and method of disposal\n\n(6) Ad.

Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor's obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency's view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject's decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB's primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor's need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n\"A sponsor's preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval.\" The effect of the IRB's NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor's wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency's policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.2754721641540527", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1?

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations permit institutions involved in multi-institutional studies to use reasonable methods of joint or cooperative review [21 CFR 56.114 and 45 CFR 46.114, respectively]. While the IRB assumes responsibility for oversight and continuing review, the clinical investigator and the research site retain the responsibility for the conduct of the study.\n\nScope of Cooperative Research Activities\n\nThe regulatory provision for cooperative review arrangements may be applied to different types of cooperative clinical investigations. Examples include research coordinated by cooperative oncology groups and participation by investigators and subjects in a clinical study primarily conducted at or administered by another institution. Often, one institution has the primary responsibility for the conduct of the study and the responsibility for administrative or coordinating functions. At other times, multi center trials may be coordinated by an office or organization that does not actually conduct the clinical study or have an IRB.\n\nWritten Cooperative Review Agreements\n\nThe cooperative research arrangements between institutions may apply to the review of one study, to certain specific categories of studies or to all studies. A single cooperative IRB may provide review for several participating institutions, but the respective responsibilities of the IRB and each institution should be agreed to in writing.\n\nAn institution may agree to delegate the responsibility for initial and continuing review to another institution's IRB. In turn, the IRB agrees to assume responsibility for initial and continuing review. The institution delegating the responsibility for review should understandthat it is agreeing to abide by the reviewing IRB's decisions. The delegating institution remains responsible for ensuring that the research conducted within its own institution is in full accordance with the determinations of the IRB providing the review and oversight.\n\nThe IRB which agrees to review studies conducted at another institution has responsibility for initial and continuing review of the research. Such an IRB, in initially reviewing the study, should take into account the required criteria for approval, the facilities and capabilities of the other institution, and the measures taken by the other institution to ensure compliance with the IRB's determinations. The reviewing IRB needs to be sensitive to factors such as community attitudes.\n\nThe agreement for IRB review of cooperative research should be documented. Depending upon the scope of the agreement, documentation may be simple, in the form of a letter, or more complex such as a formal memorandum of understanding. In the case of studies supported or conducted by HHS, arrangements or agreements may be subject to approval by HHS through the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and should be executed in accordance with OHRP's instructions. Whatever form of documentation is used, copies should be furnished to all parties to the agreement, and to those responsible for ensuring compliance with the regulations and the IRB's determinations. The IRB's records should include documentation of such agreements.\n\nWhen an IRB approves a study, it notifies (in writing) the clinical investigator and the institution at each location for which the IRB has assumed responsibility [21 CFR 56.109(d)]. All required reports from the clinical investigators should be sent directly to the responsible IRB with copies to the investigator's institution, as appropriate.\n\nMulti-institutional IRB\n\nAnother form of cooperative research activity is a multi-institutional IRB, that oversees the research activities of more than one institution in a defined area, such as a city or county. Such an IRB is formed by separate but cooperating institutions and eliminates the need for each facility to organize and staff its own IRB. A variation of this is an IRB that is established by a corporate entity to oversee research at its operating components, for example, a hospital system with facilities at several locations.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheet: \"Non-Local IRB Review\" (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/non-local-irb-review).\n23.8.20.20.5.501 501\n\nrecord submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Cooperative Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.448971152305603", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: For multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n\nSponsor personnel (usually a field engineer) may be present during the procedure and/or follow-up visits for some medical device studies. These individuals may provide technical support and/or record study-related information for the test article. If sponsor personnel will be present during the procedure or follow-up, or if the activities of the sponsor personnel directly affect the subject, those activities should also be described in the informed consent form.70\n\nFootnote 70: See \u201cGuidance for Industry: Investigator Responsibilities \u2013 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigator-responsibilities-protecting-rights-safety-and-welfare-study-subjects.\n\nThe FDA\n\nFDA's regulations for drug (including biologic) and device investigations have different requirements for the submission of informed consent materials (see sections IV.D.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and IV.D.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices,\" for additional information). Sponsors are not required to submit informed consent materials to FDA for all clinical investigations (see, for example, 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) and (c)); however, FDA may require that they be submitted in some cases as discussed below.\n\nGenerally, when informed consent materials are submitted, FDA reviewers assess the adequacy of the consent form by considering its communication of reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject and other elements required by 21 CFR 50.25. In some situations, FDA may find a consent form to be misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete in a way that would make informed consent inadequate and noncompliant with 21 CFR part 50. In these cases, FDA may require that specific revisions be made to address the concern(s) before the clinical investigation can proceed (21 CFR 312.42 and 812.30).\n\nFDA's review of the consent form as part of an IND or IDE application submission does not substitute for the responsibility or authority of the IRB to review and approve the consent form and consent process as a condition for the clinical investigation to begin (21 CFR 56.103(a)). IRBs are responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the information in the consent form and may require modification as appropriate (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b)).\n\nBelow are specific areas FDA considers in its review of the consent form:\n\nvi.2.1 Investigational New Drugs and Biologics71\n\nFootnote 71: For the purposes of this document, unless otherwise specified, all references to \u201cdrugs\u201d or \u201cdrug products\u201d include human drug products and biological products that are also drugs.\n\nThe IND regulations (21 CFR part 312) do not specifically require submission to FDA of the consent form with the IND. However, if FDA determines that review of the consent form is necessary to make the determination of whether the clinical investigation may safely proceed, the Agency will request that the sponsor submit the consent form for review under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(11).\n\nAs a general matter, FDA will review the informed consent form for treatment INDs and treatment protocols (21 CFR part 312, subpart I) and INDs for studies conducted under the Exception From Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research (21 CFR 50.24) for consistency with 21 CFR 50.25 (see 21 CFR 50.24(a)(6)).\n\nFor other clinical investigations of drugs, FDA often considers the following factors in determining whether to require submission and review of the consent form:\n\nNonclinical studies submitted in support of the first administration of a drug in humans have identified an unusual toxicity.\n\nUnusual known toxicity is associated with the investigational drug, the drug class to which the drug belongs, or with a different drug with characteristics similar to those of the study drug.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:46]\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nThis section of the guidance document is intended to provide answers to frequently asked questions about FDA's regulations for the protection of human subjects. The numbers assigned to the questions are intended for ease of reference and do not represent the frequency with which these questions are asked.\n\niv.4.1 What are some considerations for enrolling a child?2 into a clinical investigation?\n\nFDA regulations provide additional safeguards for children enrolled in clinical investigations, as described in 21 CFR part 50, subpart D.73 If a child is to be enrolled in a clinical investigation, parental or guardian permission must be obtained in accordance with the requirements for informed consent in 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 50.55(e))74 and be documented in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (21 CFR 50.55(f)). When appropriate, the assent of the child also must be obtained (see 21 CFR 50.55(a)-(d)). As with informed consent for adult subjects, the exceptions to informed consent requirements described in section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\", apply to research involving children.\n\nFootnote 72: For purposes of 21 CFR part 50, the term children means \u201cpersons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted.\u201d See 21 CFR 50.3(o).\n\nFootnote 73: FDA promulgated 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, \u201cAdditional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations,\u201d as an interim rule in April 2001 (see 66 FR 20589, April 24, 2001; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-04-24/pdf/01-10008.pdf), and issued a final rule in February 2013 (see 78 FR 12937, February 26, 2013; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-02-26/pdf/2013-04387.pdf).\n\nThe IRB may determine that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical investigations involving no greater than minimal risk to children to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.51, or clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk to children but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects in accordance with 21 CFR 50.52 (21 CFR 50.55(e)(1)).\n\nFor clinical investigations to be conducted in accordance with either 21 CFR 50.53 or 21 CFR 50.54,75 where permission is to be obtained from parents, the permission of both parents is required unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child (21 CFR 50.55(e)(2)).76\n\nFootnote 76: For additional discussion on what is meant by \u201cnot reasonably available,\u201d see the Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) recommendations at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/attachment-d-november-13-2018/indes.html.\n\nThe general requirements for informed consent, found in 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27, apply to parental permission (21 CFR 50.55(e)-(f)). When obtaining parental permission, in the event the parents of a child do not understand English, the parental permission must be obtained and documented in language that is understandable to the parents (21 CFR 50.20). The child who will be participating in the research should not be used as an interpreter for the parent, even if the child is fluent in English and may be able to assent. Similarly, if child assent is required, the information given to the child should be in language that is understandable to the child.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.011692091822624207", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1?

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nAll of the parties who conduct or have oversight responsibilities for biomedical research--sponsors, clinical investigators, and institutional review boards (IRBs)--have responsibility for ensuring that the research complies with applicable laws and regulations and that risks to subjects are minimized. Although selection of clinical investigators and research sites, and determining if an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) is required are viewed primarily as sponsor responsibilities, FDA is issuing this guidance to clarify IRBs' responsibilities related to these activities and to encourage all parties to work together in order to protect the rights and welfare of study subjects.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nTo enhance protection of human subjects and reduce regulatory burden, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and FDA have been actively working to harmonize the agencies' regulatory requirements and guidance for human subject research. This guidance document was developed as a part of these efforts and in consultation with OHRP.\n\nII Background\n\nMany of the recommendations in this guidance have appeared in other FDA guidance documents2 or have been communicated to IRBs who have contacted the agency directly about these issues. FDA has also provided instructions to its field investigators on the types of records that should be reviewed during an IRB inspection to determine whether the IRB performed an evaluation of an investigator's qualifications, assessed the adequacy of a site, and questioned whether an IND or IDE is necessary.3 FDA has compiled the recommendations from these various sources into this guidance to ensure that all IRBs have access to it. In addition, FDA provides guidance on how IRBs may efficiently fulfill these important responsibilities.\n\nFootnote 2: ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance, 3.1.3 and 4.1.1\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM07312.pdf.\n\nFootnote 3: Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM) 7348.809, Institutional Review Boards, November 28, 2011, generally, and Section III.J, K, and U;\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/EnforcementActions/BioresearchMonitoring/UCM133768.pdf.\n\nThe recommendations in this guidance are applicable to any IRB, independent or affiliated with an institution, whether serving as a local IRB or as the central IRB for other IRBs or institutions participating in a centralized review process for multi-site studies. The recommendations are general in order to provide IRBs with necessary flexibility in developing agreements for cooperative research as described in 21 CFR 56.114. As discussed in Guidance for Industry - Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,4 FDA recommends that IRBs and institutions participating in a centralized review process agree on how to divide and carry out these responsibilities, and that such agreements be in writing to help ensure that the rights and welfare of study subjects are protected.\n\nFootnote 4: http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127004.htm.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nMust an IRB review the qualifications of clinical investigators who conduct FDA-regulated research?\n\nYes. Although FDA's regulations place responsibility on the sponsor to select clinical investigators who are \"qualified by training and experience as appropriate experts\" to investigate the test article,5 IRB also have a role in reviewing an investigator's qualifications.6 The regulations at 21 CFR 56.107(a) require that an IRB \"...be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice...\" In addition, the regulations at 21 CFR 56.111 require that an IRB determine that the proposed research satisfies the criteria for approval, including that \"...risks to subjects areminimized...[and] reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects...\" In order to fulfill these responsibilities, the IRB needs information about the qualifications of the investigator(s) to conduct and supervise the proposed research. Depending upon the nature and risks of the proposed research and the relationship between the IRB and the investigator or the institution where the proposed research is being conducted, this may be relatively simple and straightforward or it may entail a more involved assessment.\n\nIn many cases, the IRB may have previous experience with an investigator or institution that would allow the IRB to readily determine that the clinical investigator is appropriately qualified to conduct and supervise the proposed research. In other cases, the IRB may need additional information; however, the IRB should be able to obtain a statement confirming the investigator's qualifications from an administrator of the institution. For example, for proposed research to be conducted at a hospital where only credentialed hospital staff may conduct research, the IRB may be able to rely on another office at the institution (e.g., the credentialing office, the clinical investigator's medical department) for information about the clinical investigator's qualifications. For proposed research to be conducted by a university faculty member (e.g., at an affiliated hospital or clinic), the IRB may be able to obtain a statement regarding the investigator's qualifications from the chair of the investigator's department.\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Responsibilities for Reviewing the Qualifications of Investigators, Adequacy of Research Sites, and the Determination of Whether an IND:IDE is Needed Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.378585934638977", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator's responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution's IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution's IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be \"men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.\"1 In addition, IRB members must \"be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice\" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution's own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution's own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution's IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution's IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution's IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution's IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution's IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution's IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.2430739402770996", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: 3 DMCs and Other oversight Groups\n\nSeveral different groups and individuals may assume or share responsibility for various aspects of clinical trial monitoring and oversight, and it is important to recognize the different roles they play. These groups are all components of a system that assists sponsors in conducting trials that are ethical and that produce valid and credible results. The sponsor of a clinical trial takes responsibility for and initiates the investigation (21 CFR 50.3(e); 21 CFR 312.3; 21 CFR 812.3(n)). Typically, the sponsor holds the Investigational New Drug Application or Investigational Device Exemption (IND/IDE) (21 CFR 312.40(a)(1); 21 CFR 812.40).2The responsibilities delegated to steering committees or contract research organizations (CROs) by a manufacturer and/or funding agency can vary considerably. It is important that the responsibilities and authorities of the product manufacturer, the funding organization (if different) and any other entity be clearly defined and understood by all parties at the start of the endeavor. Potential conflicts of interest of each party, especially sponsors and clinical investigators (see 21 CFR Part 54) should be carefully considered when determining roles and responsibilities.\n\nInstitutional Review Boards\n\nAn institutional review board (IRB) is responsible for evaluating a trial to determine, among other things, whether \"[r]isks to subjects are minimized\" and \"[r]isks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits\" (21 CFR 56.111(a)). An IRB's evaluation entails review of the study protocol, relevant background information, the informed consent document, proposed plans for informing participants about the trial, and any other procedures associated with the trial. To determine whether risks to subjects are minimized by \"using procedures which are consistent with sound research design\" (21 CFR 56.111(a)(1)(i)), an IRB may appropriately request information about the approach to trial monitoring, including the statistical basis for early termination, when relevant, and what steps the sponsor is taking to minimize the risks to patients. As part of its oversight, therefore, an IRB may appropriately inquire as to whether a DMC has been established and, if so, seek information about its scope and composition.\n\nFor ongoing trials, the IRB is responsible for considering information arising from the trial that may bear on the continued acceptability of the trial at the study site(s) it oversees (see 21 CFR 56.103). A DMC, on the other hand, generally has access to much more data than the IRB during the trial, including interim efficacy and safety outcomes by treatment arm, and makes recommendations with regard to the entire trial. Given its obligation to minimize the risks to patients, an IRB may take action based on information from any appropriate source, including recommendations from a DMC to the sponsor. A trial may have multiple IRBs, each responsible for the patients at a single site, but only one DMC. Under 21 CFR 56.103, 21 CFR 312.66, 21 CFR 812.40, and 21 CFR 812.150(a), individual investigators (or the sponsor of investigational devices) are responsible for assuring that IRBs are made aware of significant new information that arises about a clinical trial. Such information may include DMC recommendations to the sponsor that are communicated to IRB(s), either directly or through individual investigators or sponsors. Additionally, it may be useful for sponsors to ensure that IRBs are informed when DMCs have met, even when no problems have been identified and the DMC has recommended continuation of the trial as designed.\n\nClinical Trial Steering Committees\n\nIn some clinical trials the sponsor may choose to appoint a steering committee; this committee may include investigators, other experts not otherwise involved in the trial, and, usually, representatives of the sponsor. A sponsor may delegate to a steering committee the primary responsibility for designing the study, maintaining the quality of study conduct, ongoing monitoring of individual toxicities and adverse events, and, in many cases, writing study publications. When there is a steering committee, the sponsor may elect to have the DMC communicate with this committee rather than directly with the sponsor. Interactions between the steering committee and the DMC consist primarily of discussions during \"open sessions\" (see Section 4.3) of DMC meetings and the communication of recommendations following each DMC review of the trial. More extensive interactions might occur when early termination is being considered, or when external forces (e.g., announcement of results of related studies) impact the ongoing trial.\n\nEndpoint Assessment/Adjudication Committees\n\nSponsors may also choose to establish an endpoint assessment/adjudication committee (these may also be known as clinical events committees) in certain trials to review important endpoints reported by trial investigators to determine whether the endpoints meet protocol-specified criteria. Information reviewed on each presumptive endpoint may include laboratory, pathology and/or imaging data, autopsy reports, physical descriptions, and any other data deemed relevant. These committees are typically masked to the assigned study arm when performing their assessments regardless of whether the trial itself is conducted in a blinded manner. Such committees are particularly valuable when endpoints are subjective and/or require the application of a complex definition, and when the intervention is not delivered in a blinded fashion. Although such committees do not share responsibility with DMCs for evaluating interim comparisons, their assessments (if performed at frequent intervals throughout the trial with results incorporated into the database in a timely manner) help to ensure that the data reviewed by DMCs are as accurate and free of bias as possible.\n\nSite/Clinical Monitoring\n\nThe sponsor or a group under contract to the sponsor generally performs site/clinical monitoring of a clinical trial to assure high quality trial conduct. They perform \"on site\" monitoring of individual case histories, assess adherence to the protocol, ensure the ongoing implementation of appropriate data entry and quality control procedures, and in general assess adherence to good clinical practices. In blinded studies, these monitors remain blinded to study arm assignment.\n\nOthers with Monitoring Responsibilities\n\nIn addition to those described above, other groups have important monitoring responsibilities. Study investigators, of course, have the front-line responsibility for identifying potential adverse effects experienced by study participants, adjusting the intervention accordingly and reporting the experience to the sponsor. The sponsor is responsible for monitoring and analyzing these investigator reports and relaying them as required to FDA, other regulatory authorities (as appropriate) and other investigators (21 CFR 312.32(c), 21 CFR 812.40). The sponsor and FDA, respectively, also review adverse experience reports from all trials of a given product (21 CFR 312.32(c); 21 CFR 812.150(b)). In addition, for medical device studies, sponsors are responsible for ensuring that FDA and any reviewing IRB(s) are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation (21 CFR 812.40). For drug and biologic studies, sponsors must notify IRBs, as well as FDA and other investigators, if the sponsor withdraws the IND for a safety reason (21 CFR 312.38(c)).\n\n4 Dmc Establishment and Operation\n\nCommittee Composition\n\nThe selection of DMC members is extremely important, as DMC responsibilities relate to the safety of trial participants. A poorly constituted DMC may fail to note problems that should be addressed, or may make recommendations that are unwarranted or whose consequences are inadequately considered, thereby undermining the safety of participants as well as the value of the trial. The ability of DMCs to provide the anticipated additional assurance of patient safety and trial integrity therefore depends on appropriate selection of DMC members.\n\nThe sponsor and/or trial steering committee generally appoint members of a DMC. Factors to consider in the selection of individuals to serve on a DMC typically include relevant expertise, experience in clinical trials and in serving on other DMCs, and absence of serious conflicts of interest as discussed below. The objectives and design of the trial and the scope of the responsibilities given to the DMC determine the types of expertise needed for a particular DMC.\n\nMost DMCs are composed of clinicians with expertise in relevant clinical specialties and at least one biostatistician knowledgeable about statistical methods for clinical trials and sequential analysis of trial data. For trials with unusually high risks or with broad public health implications, the DMC may include a medical ethicist knowledgeable about the design, conduct, and interpretation of clinical trials. Prior DMC experience is important when considering the committee as a whole; it is highly desirable that at least some members have prior DMC service. Prior DMC experience is particularly important for the statistical DMC member if there is only one statistician serving on the DMC.\n\nSome trials may require participation of other types of scientists. Toxicologists, epidemiologists, and clinical pharmacologists, for example, could be included in particular cases when such expertise appears important for informed interpretation of interim results.\n--------------------\nContext title: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.6633150577545166"], "Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nChanges to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Specifications - Use of Enforcement\n\nDiscretion for Compendial Changes\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nNovember 2004\n\nCMC\n\nChapter 6\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Compliance and the Office of Pharmaceutical Science in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nChanges to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Specifications - Use of Enforcement Discretion for Compendial Changes\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

In the exercise of its enforcement discretion, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action if manufacturers continue to submit such changes in their annual reports. The use of enforcement discretion will give the Agency time to clarify that some of these types of postapproval changes can be submitted in an annual report, rather than in a CBE-30. The Agency intends to clarify this issue in an upcoming revision to the guidance for industry\n\nChanges to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nBackground\n\nOn April 8, 2004, FDA published in the Federal Register (69 FR 18728) the final rule entitled Supplements and Other Changes to an Approved Application. In the same issue of the Federal Register (69 FR 18768), FDA announced the availability of the guidance for industry entitled Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (the Changes guidance). The final rule sets forth requirements for postapproval changes.\n\nUnder section 314.70(c)(2)(iii) of the final rule, the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test to comply with an official compendium that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements must be submitted as a supplement - changes-being-effected-in-30 days (CBE-30) (see section VIII.C.1.e of the Changes guidance). Under 314.70(d)(2)(i) of the final rule, any change in a specification made to comply with an official compendium, except the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements, is to be submitted as an Annual Report (see section VIII.D.1 of the Changes guidance).\n\nSince publication of the final rule, the Agency has received communications from NDA and ANDA holders requesting clarification of the regulation as it applies to changes such as excipient monographs and general chapters. As written now, the regulations could be interpreted to require a CBE for any compendial change to relax or delete a test, resulting in an increase in the number of supplements, something that was not intended. The Agency plans to revise the Guidance for Industry: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers to provide more specific recommendations as to what types of changes can be submitted in an annual report instead of a CBE-30 supplement.\n\nIn addition, the Agency is aware that stakeholders have expressed concern that the final rule (i.e., 21 CFR 314.70), which published on April 8, 2004, and the accompanying Changes guidance do not take into consideration the recent FDA Pharmaceutical CGMP Initiative for the 21({}^{\\rm st}) Century. Accordingly, the Agency plans to align this guidance with the initiative in order to facilitate manufacturing changes to enhance product quality.\n\nIII Exercise of enforcement discretion\n\nFDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion and does not intend to take action to enforce compliance with the compendial changes requirement as stated in 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii) if manufacturers submit such changes in their annual reports. FDA intends to develop further guidance to clarify the requirere nts of 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Specifications \u2013 Use of Enforcement Discretion for Compendial Changes Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.7547481060028076", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Cuidance for Industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nApril 2004\n\nCMC\n\nRevision 1\n\nChapter 5 Challenges for Industry NDA or ANDA\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Drug Information, HFD-240\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nApril 2004\n\nCMC\n\nRevision 1\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared under the direction of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Coordinating Committee in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act Public Burden Statement: This guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).

If you have any questions about the effect of any portion of this guidance, contact the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-003), Food and Drug Association, 5600 Fisher's Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\n1 Introduction and Background\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to holders of new drug applications (NDAs) and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) who intend to make postapproval changes in accordance with section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and $ 314.70 (21 CFR 314.70). The guidance covers recommended reporting categories for postapproval changes for drugs other than specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products. It supersedes the guidance of the same title published November 1999. Recommendations are provided for postapproval changes in (1) components and composition, (2) manufacturing sites, (3) manufacturing process, (4) specifications, (5) container closure system, and (6) labeling, as well as (7) miscellaneous changes and (8) multiple related changes.\n\nRecommendations on reporting categories for changes relating to specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products regulated by CDER are found in the guidance for industryentitled Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products (July 1997).2\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is currently revising the 1997 guidance and intends to issue it in draft for public comment.\n\nOn November 21, 1997, the President signed the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act).3 Section 116 of the Modernization Act amended the the Act by adding section 506A, which provides requirements for making and reporting manufacturing changes to an approved application and for distributing a drug product made with such changes. The FDA has revised its regulations on supplements and other changes to an approved application (21 CFR 314.70) to conform to section 506A of the Act.\n\nFootnote 3: Public Law 105-115.\n\nThis guidance does not provide recommendations on the specific information that should be developed by an applicant to assess the effect of the change on the identity, strength (e.g., assay, content uniformity), quality (e.g., physical, chemical, and biological properties), purity (e.g., impurities and degradation products), or potency (e.g., biological activity, bioavailability, bioequivalence) of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. An applicant should consider all relevant CDER guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change.4\n\nFootnote 4: A list of CDER guidances is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nCDER has published guidances, including the SUPAC (scale-up and postapproval changes) guidances, that provide recommendations on reporting categories. To the extent that the recommendations on reporting categories in this guidance are found to be inconsistent with guidances published before this guidance was finalized, the recommended reporting categories in such previously published guidances are superseded by this guidance. This guidance does not provide extensive recommendations on reporting categories for components and composition changes (see section V). Therefore, recommended reporting categories for components and composition changes provided in previously published guidances, such as the SUPAC guidances, still apply. Section 506A of the Act and SS 314.70(c) provide for two types of changes-being-effected supplements (see section II), while previously there was only one type. It is important for applicants to use this guidance to determine which type of changes-being-effected supplement is recommended. CDER intends to update the previously published guidances to make them consistent with this guidance.\n\nIf guidance for either recommended reporting categories or information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, the appropriate CDER chemistry or microbiology review staff can be consulted for advice.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, in general, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. Insofar as this guidance adjusts reporting categories pursuant to section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR 314.70, it does have binding effect. If you have any questions about the effect of any portion of this guidance, contact the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-003), Food and Drug Association, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\nII Reporting Categories\n\nSection 506A of the Act and $ 314.70 provide for four reporting categories that are distinguished in the following paragraphs.\n\nA major change is a change that has a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. A major change requires the submission of a supplement and approval by FDA prior to distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement ($ 314.70(b)). An applicant may ask FDA to expedite its review of a prior approval supplement for public health reasons (e.g., drug shortage) or if a delay in making the change described in it would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement - Expedited Review Requested ($ 314.70(b)(4)).5 FDA is most likely to grant requests for expedited review based on extraordinary hardship for manufacturing changes made necessary by catastrophic events (e.g., fire) or by events that could not be reasonably foreseen and for which the applicant could not plan.\n\nFootnote 5: Internal Agency policies and procedures relating to processing requests for expedited review of supplements to approved ANDAs and NDAs are documented in CDER\u2019s Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) at 5240.1 and 5310.3, respectively. MAPPs can be located on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/mapp.htm.\n\nA moderate change is a change that has a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. There are two types of moderate change. One type of moderate change requires the submission of a supplement to FDA at least 30 days before the distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Supplement - Changes Being Effected in 30 Days ($ 314.70(c)(3)). The drug product made using a moderate change cannot be distributed if FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that a prior approval supplement is required ($ 314.70(c)(5)(i)). For each change, the supplement must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and must include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change ($ 314.70(a)(2) and (c)(4)). If FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that information is missing, distribution must be delayed until the supplement has been amended to provide the missing information ($ 314.70(c)(5)(ii)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.111809492111206", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nRevising ANDA Labeling Following Revision of the RLD Labeling\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nMay 2000\n\nOGD\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Generic Drugs in the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), at the Food and Drug Administration. This guidance document represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on changes in labeling of approved abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) following revisions in the RLD\u2019s labeling. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes, regulations, or both.\n\nRevising ANDA Labeling Following\n\nRevision of the RLD Labeling\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) in deciding when and how to submit labeling supplements following labeling revisions to their reference listed drugs (RLDs).\n\nII Background\n\nDuring the marketing life of a drug product approved under a new drug application (NDA), the package insert labeling is frequently revised. When an NDA serves as an RLD for an ANDA, approved changes in the RLD labeling generally necessitate changes in the labeling of one or more ANDAs using the RLD. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and Agency regulations, an ANDA product must have the same labeling as the RLD. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(v) of the Act states that an abbreviated application for a new drug must contain\n\ninformation to show that the labeling proposed for the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed drug...except for changes required because of differences approved under a petition...or because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or distributed by different manufacturers.\n\nSimilar statements are also found in the regulations at 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8)(iv).\n\nPreviously, OGD notified the appropriate ANDA sponsors when the approved labeling of their RLD changed. This was usually done using a formal supplement request letter. In cases where an NDA served as the RLD for multiple generic products, the preparation ofa large number of request letters took a significant amount of review staff time. With the increase in the numbers of approved NDAs and ANDAs, this approach was using an increasingly disproportionate share of OGD's resources. Because of the time it took, the approach sometimes even delayed the notification of ANDA sponsors. With the exception of a few special situations (noted below), OGD is no longer providing this type of notification. The sponsor of an ANDA is now responsible for ensuring that the labeling contained in its application is the same as the currently approved labeling of the RLD. OGD has determined that this change in responsibility is necessary to minimize the implementation time for the introduction of revised labeling into the market place. OGD believes that prompt revision, submission to the Agency, and implementation of revised labeling are important to ensure the continued safe and effective use of generic drug products. Because the regulations state that the labeling of the generic must be the same as the innovator, the revision should be made at the very earliest time possible. If there is any potential delay in the revision of a generic drug labeling, the sponsor should contact OGD.\n\n3 How to obtain information on a change in RLD labeling\n\nThe sponsor of an ANDA should routinely monitor the Labeling Review Branch Homepage (see below) for information on changes in labeling. OGD's Labeling Review Branch will:\n\nPlace monthly updates of approved labeling changes for RLDs with approved ANDAs on the Labeling Review Branch Homepage at: http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/rld/labeling_review_branch.html\n\nContinue to notify ANDA applicants by facsimile, telephone, and/or letter for any labeling revision approved for the RLD that warrants immediate widespread professional notification, such as those changes connected to issuing a Dear Doctor Letter or similar significant changes.\n\nAll approved labeling for RLDs is still available from Freedom of Information Staff. Sponsors who wish to obtain labeling using this mechanism should send a written or facsimile request to:\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nFreedom of Information Staff (HFI-35)\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-827-6500; FAX: 301-443-1726\n\nWhen a labeling revision is needed, the ANDA sponsor should take appropriate action to revise the ANDA labeling and submit the revised labeling to the FDA.\n\nHow to submit revised labeling\n\nAll ANDA labeling changes needed because of approved changes to the labeling of the RLD may be submitted as a Special Supplement - Changes Being Effected. Such supplements should include:\n\n12 copies of final printed labeling\n\nthe date the revised labeling will be used (go into effect)\n\na side-by-side comparison of the ANDA labeling with the approved labeling of the RLD with all differences annotated and explained, as described in 21 CFR 314.94 (a)(8)(iv)\n\nSponsors should contact the OGD Labeling Review Branch at 301-827-5846 if there are any questions about the information in this guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Revising ANDA Labeling Following Revision of the RLD Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.1942097246646881", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix 3: Processing Prior to Filling and Sealing Operations\n\nThe purpose of this appendix is to supplement the guidance provided in this document with information on products regulated by CBER or CDER that are subject to aseptic processing at points early in the manufacturing process, or that require aseptic processing through the entire manufacturing process because it is impossible to sterile filter the final drug product. The scope of this appendix includes aseptic processing activities that take place prior to the filling and sealing of the finished drug product. Special considerations include those for:\n\nAseptic processing from early manufacturing steps\n\nSome products undergo aseptic processing at some or all manufacturing steps preceding the final product closing step. With other products, there is a point in the process after which they can no longer be rendered sterile by filtration. In such cases, the product would be handled aseptically at all steps subsequent to sterile filtration. In other instances, the final drug product cannot be sterile-filtered and, therefore, each component in the formulation would be rendered sterile and mixed aseptically. For example, products containing aluminum adjuvant are formulated aseptically because once they are alum adsorbed, they cannot be sterile-filtered.\n\nWhen a product is processed aseptically from the early stages, the product and all components or other additions are rendered sterile prior to entering the manufacturing process. It is critical that all transfers, transports, and storage stages be carefully controlled at each step of the process to maintain sterility of the product. In some cases, bulk drug substances or products should be tested for sterility.24\n\nFootnote 24: See 21 CFR 610.12 for general biological product standards for sterility.\n\nProcedures (e.g., aseptic connection) that expose a product or product contact surfaces should be performed under unidirectional airflow in a Class 100 (ISO 5) environment. The environment of the room surrounding the Class 100 (ISO 5) environment should be Class 10,000 (ISO 7) or better. Microbiological and airborne particle monitoring should be performed during operations. Microbial surface monitoring should be performed at the end of operations, but prior to cleaning. Personnel monitoring should be performed in association with operations.\n\nProcess simulation studies covering the steps preceding filling and sealing should be designed to incorporate all conditions, product manipulations, and interventions that could impact on the sterility of the product. The process simulation, from the early process steps, should demonstrate that process controls are adequate to protect the product during manufacturing. These studies should incorporate all product manipulations, additions, and procedures involving exposure of product contact surfaces to the environment. The studies should include worst-case conditions such as maximum duration of open operations and maximum number of participating operators. However, the process simulations do not need to mimic total manufacturing time if the manipulations that occur during manufacturing are adequately represented.\n\nIt is also important that process simulations incorporate storage of sterile bulk drug substances or product and transport to other manufacturing areas. For instance, there should be assurance of bulk vessel integrity for specified holding times. The transport of sterile bulk tanks or other containers should be simulated as part of the media fill. Please refer to Section IX.A for moreguidance on media simulation studies. Process simulation studies for the formulation stage should be performed at least twice per year.\n\nAseptic processing of cellular therapy products and cell-derived products\n\nCellular therapy and some cell-derived products (e.g., lysates, semi-purified extracts) represent a subset of the products that cannot be filter-sterilized and therefore undergo aseptic manipulations throughout the manufacturing process. Where possible, closed systems should be used during manufacturing. Cellular therapy products often have short processing times at each manufacturing stage, particularly between the harvest, formulation of the final product, and product release. These products are frequently released from the manufacturing facility and administered to patients before final product sterility testing results are available. In situations where results of final sterility testing are not available before the product is administered, additional controls and testing should be considered. For example, additional sterility tests can be performed at intermediate stages of manufacture, such as after the last manipulation of the product prior to harvest. Other tests that may indicate microbial contamination, such as microscopic examination, Gram stain (or other bacterial and fungal stain), and endotoxin testing should be performed and meet acceptance criteria prior to product release.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] ISO 14644-1: Cleanrooms and Associated Controlled Environments, Classification of Air Cleanliness.\n\n[2] NASA Standard for Cleanroom and Work Stations for Microbially Controlled Environment, Publication NHB 5340.2 (August 1967).\n\n[3] Technical Order 00-25-203, Contamination Control of Aerospace Facilities, U.S. Air Force, December l, 1972.\n\n[4] Ljungqvist, B., and Reinmuller, B., Cleanroom Design: Minimizing Contamination Through Proper Design; Interpharm Press, 1997.\n\n[5] Lord, A. and J.

This guidance document represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on the advisory committee provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nAdvisory Committees: Implementing Section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis document provides guidance for industry on changes to the policies and procedures being used by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) with regard to advisory committees as a result of section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). This guidance document supplements the policies and procedures described in the Policy and Guidance Handbook for FDA Advisory Committee. In general, the guidance explains modifications, prompted by the Modernization Act, in CDER's and CBER's practices with regard to advisory committees.\n\nII Background\n\nAdvisory committees provide independent advice and recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on scientific and technical matters related to the development and evaluation of products regulated by the Agency. Through the advisory committee system, FDA is able to secure independent professional expertise in accomplishing its mission and maintaining the public trust. CDER and CBER request advice from advisory committees on a variety of matters, including various aspects of clinical investigations and applications for marketing approval of drug products. Although the committees provide recommendations to the Agency, final decisions are made by FDA.\n\nOn November 21, 1997, President Clinton signed the Modernization Act. Section 120 of the Modernization Act amends section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) by adding section 505(n). Section 505(n)(1) of the Act directs FDA to establish panels of experts, or to use already-established panels of experts, to provide scientific advice and recommendations to the Agency regarding the clinical investigation of drugs or the approval for marketing of drugs. FDA understands the term panels of experts to mean advisory committees.\n\nSection 505(n) of the Act includes provisions for (1) additional members to be included in new advisory committees, (2) new conflict of interest considerations, (3) education and training for new committee members, (4) timely committee consideration of matters, and (5) timely Agency notification to affected persons of decisions on matters considered by advisory committees.\n\nFDA regulations in 21 CFR Part 14 establish the general procedures for Agency use of advisory committees. FDA has determined that these regulations, described in pertinent part in this guidance document, do not need to be amended for CDER and CBER to implement the modifications in advisory committee policies and procedures that have resulted from the enactment of section 505(n) of the Act.\n\nBecause CDER and CBER advisory committees are organized according to general subject (e.g., blood products, cardiovascular and renal drugs) and not according to the topic for consideration by the committee (e.g., a clinical investigation of a drug product, the content of a guidance document), CDER and CBER generally use the same policies and procedures for all advisory committees, regardless of the topic that will be considered by the committee. Consequently, unless otherwise stated, the following guidance applies to CDER and CBER advisory committees regardless of the topic for consideration.\n\n3 Membership\n\nAdvisory committees generally consist of individuals possessing recognized expertise and judgment in a specific field. Members have the training and experience necessary to evaluate information objectively and to interpret its significance under various, often controversial, circumstances.\n\nSection 505(n)(3) of the Act describes the membership requirements for new advisory committees that may be established under section 505(n)(1) of the Act. Advisory committees that are already chartered need not amend their membership to comply with these new provisions. However, in the interest of furthering the goals of the statutory amendments, CDER and CBER intend generally to modify current advisory committee membership on a meeting-by-meeting basis and to recharter committees, as needed, to reflect the representation described in section 505(n)(3) of the Act.\n\nAdvisory committee membership under the new statute is comprised of core members of the panel and other individuals who may be called upon to participate in a given meeting on an ad hoc basis. The core members of the advisory committee are appointed by the Commissioner or his/her designee based on their scientific or technical expertise and serve for the duration of the committee or until their terms of appointment expire, they resign, or they are removed by the Commissioner or his/her designee (21 CFR 14.80). In accordance with section 505(n)(3) of the Act, the Commissioner or his/her designee may call upon individuals to supplement the core membership on an ad hoc basis so that the group considering an issue presented to an advisory committee may also include (1) representation of consumer/patient interests, (2) representation from the interests of the drug manufacturing industry, and (3) at least two members who are specialists with expertise in the particular disease or condition for which the drug under consideration is proposed to be indicated.\n\nVoting members of an advisory committee have expertise, as demonstrated by training, education,and experience, in the subject matter that the committee is considering. To the extent feasible, voting members should possess skill and experience in the development, manufacture, or use of the types of drugs to be referred to the committee, and the group of voting members should reflect a balanced composition of scientific expertise through members with diverse professional education, training, and experience (21 CFR 14.80(b)(1)). Core members of an advisory committee will be voting members of the committee, to the extent that such participation is not prevented by conflict of interest laws and regulations. Ad hoc committee members who are representatives of consumer or patient interests, or who have expertise in the particular disease or condition for which the drug under consideration is proposed to be indicated, will be voting members if (1) the members have the requisite scientific or technical expertise and (2) this participation is not prevented by conflict of interest laws and regulations. Because of inherent conflict of interest concerns, representatives of the drug manufacturing industry will not be voting members of the committee. Furthermore, no person who is a regular full-time employee of the United States government and is engaged in the administration of the Act may be a voting member of an advisory committee (section 505(n)(3) of the Act).\n\nAdvisory committee members who vote at committee meetings are selected in accordance with 21 CFR 14.80 and 14.82. At the beginning of each committee meeting, those members who are voting members will be announced.\n\nIV Conflicts of Interest\n--------------------\nContext title: Implementation of Section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997-Advisory Committees \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.986181259155273", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.3 21 CFR 820.50, Purchasing Controls\n\nManufacturer A is required to control its purchasing activities, including for the syringe components, in accordance with 21 CFR 820.50.124 For example, if the syringe barrel and plunger material is critical to ensuring that there is no adverse reaction with the drug, Manufacturer A should structure purchasing agreements with Manufacturer B to ensure that Manufacturer A is notified of any changes to this material prior to implementation of the change. Similarly, if Manufacturer A uses an outside facility for terminal sterilization of the prefilled syringe, Manufacturer A must also have appropriate controls over that sterilization service provider.125\n\nFootnote 124: In addition, because the device constituent part (syringe) is also a container/closure for the drug, Manufacturer A must perform acceptance testing of the syringe components in accordance with 21 CFR 211.84.\n\n3.3.4 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and Preventive Actions\n\nManufacturer A is required to establish and maintain CAPA procedures for the combination product. Following are two examples of issues that might arise and exemplary steps for addressing them:\n\nExample 1: Manufacturer A has implemented in-process manufacturing verification procedures to confirm that the syringe is being filled with the correct amount of the drug, and the data from this verification are analyzed for potential nonconformities. Manufacturer A notes an increase in nonconformities relating to the volume of drug being put in the syringe and in turn opens a CAPA to investigate the problem. Upon investigation of the cause of the improper fill volume, Manufacturer A determines that maintenance procedures on the filling equipment are the cause of the incorrect fill volume. Manufacturer A updates the maintenance procedures and performs verification/validation testing to confirm that the changes correct the problem and do not cause new ones.\n\nExample 2: Manufacturer A begins receiving an increased number of customer complaints related to holes or other damage to the syringe's sterile package and opens a CAPA to investigate the issue. The CAPA reveals that Manufacturer B has made changes to a syringe component such that there are sharp edges that can damage the sterile pouch during shipping.\n\nManufacturer A works with Manufacturer B to eliminate the sharp edge or finds a new supplier. Manufacturer A also augments purchasing specifications and acceptance test steps to perform visual inspection of the syringe components. Manufacturer A repeats related design verification testing to ensure that the new syringe meets all design requirements and does not result in pouch damage during shipping.\n\n21 CFR 820.170, Installation and 820.200, Servicing Installation and servicing requirements would not apply to the prefilled syringe because the product does not require installation or servicing activities.\n\nAppendix B Drug-coated mesh\n\nb.1 Scenario Description\n\nManufacturer A plans to sell a synthetic surgical mesh coated with a drug. Manufacturer A has a marketing authorization to sell the uncoated mesh. Manufacturer A wants to coat the mesh with a drug to treat infection at the site of the product's implantation. Manufacturer B has an approval to market a drug for local administration to treat infection at the site of implantation of this class of device, but not in a formulation suitable for coating onto the mesh. Manufacturer A has established a business relationship with Manufacturer B to use the drug and develop the data needed to support Manufacturer A's marketing authorization for the coated mesh. Manufacturer B will manufacture the drug formulation for spraying onto the mesh, and Manufacturer A will manufacture the finished drug-coated mesh combination product.\n\nb.2 Compliance with QS regulation requirements\n\nThe coated mesh product is a single-entity combination product under 21 CFR 3.2(e)(1). Therefore, Manufacturer A is subject both to the drug CGMPs and the device QS regulation for this combination product. Accordingly, Manufacturer A must ensure that its CGMP operating system complies with both the device QS regulation and drug CGMPs, in accordance with one of the approaches permitted under 21 CFR 4.4. Because Manufacturer A is already marketing the uncoated mesh, it has an existing device QS regulation-based operating system, and chooses to operate under a device QS regulation-based streamlined approach for the combination product. This discussion focuses on design control and purchasing control considerations arising from inclusion of the drug constituent part in the combination product.\n\n21 CFR 820.30, Design Controls\n\nA focus of the design control process for the drug constituent part of the combination product is to ensure that the drug-coated mesh will be safe and effective for treating infection at the site of implantation. Accordingly, if the necessary dose of the drug for effective treatment of infection, for example, is already known, it would be an input (if the precise dose is not yet known, then an input would be that the product elute a safe and effective dose); design outputs\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:47]\n\nand the coating thickness (specified in process controls over the application of the coating by Manufacturer A). * A user need is that a physician be able to use the mesh product as labeled without damaging the drug coating or the mesh material. Manufacturer A would have to verify that the mechanical properties of the coated mesh are such that the product can withstand the stresses anticipated during the surgical procedure and still perform as intended.130 The results would be used to define and develop design outputs for the combination product, including in-process acceptance testing criteria during manufacturing, appropriate product specifications for the drug coated mesh, and instructions for use. * Another input to the design process is that the product have a shelf-life consistent with the stability of the drug formulation and the mesh. Manufacturer A would perform design verification testing such as bench testing after aging to confirm that the critical performance properties of the mesh material are not degraded during storage or as a result of contact with the drug coating, as well as stability studies131 to ensure that the properties of the drug are not degraded over the expected shelf life. The design outputs arising from this process would include the labeled expiration date and storage conditions for the combination product and packaging design specifications. * Risk analysis and mitigation The table below lists some potential risks associated with a surgical mesh coated with a drug, and potential mitigations for these risks.\n\nAll of the design control activities required by 21 CFR 820.30 (summarized in IV.A.2 above) must be addressed in the DHF for the drug-coated mesh. The information developed as a result of design control activities will be assessed as part of premarket review of this combination product (e.g., the suitability of the drug formulation and the compatibility of the mesh with the drug). Accordingly, much of the information included in the DHF would be submitted as part of the premarket review process. Manufacturer A may opt to incorporate such information into the DHF by cross-reference to such premarket documentation. Whatever approach Manufacturer A selects must ensure that all required design history information is readily available to FDA for review.\n\nThe DHF for the surgical mesh must include design input, output, verification and validation data, and the results of design reviews for the combination product. In developing the design controls related to the drug constituent part, Manufacturer A may rely on the safety, efficacy, quality and in situ dose data for the drug as independently marketed. These existing data that supported approval of the drug would be available as a reference for the combination product DHF to enable development of design inputs for the drug constituent part and the combination product as a whole, and thus facilitate its development process.\n\n5.2.2 21 Cfr 820.50, Purchasing Controls\n\nManufacturer A already has established procedures for controlling purchasing/supplier activities pursuant to 21 CFR 820.50. Under this provision, Manufacturer A must ensure that appropriate purchasing controls for Manufacturer B are established and maintained. In particular, based on risk associated with the drug and supplier, Manufacturer A must evaluate Manufacturer B as a potential supplier of the drug and establish the type and extent of control to be exercised over Manufacturer B as a selected supplier.132\n\nFootnote 132: See 21 CFR 820.50(a)(2).\n\nPurchasing controls (and acceptance activities under 21 CFR 211.84) with respect to the drug constituent part should focus on ensuring that Manufacturer B can supply the drug that meets the specifications that Manufacturer A has established during the design control process. Manufacturer A should establish purchasing agreements with Manufacturer B to ensure that Manufacturer A is notified of any changes that may affect the performance of the combination product prior to Manufacturer B's implementation of the changes. The notifications should address issues including changes in the drug specification, its components, composition of drug coating materials, or the drug manufacturing process or facility. Such proposed changes may require that Manufacturer A complete additional design verification and/or validation. For example, verification testing may be necessary to confirm that the purity and stability of the drug is maintained, pursuant to the requirements of 21 CFR 820.30(i).\n\n5.3 C. Drug Eluting Stent (DES)\n\n5.3.1 Scenario Description\n--------------------\nContext title: Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.504650115966797"], "Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.082624912261963", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.7039291858673096", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA's Policy on Declaring Small\n\nAmounts of Nutrients and Dietary\n\nIngredients on Nutrition Labels:\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling, HFS-820\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-2371\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA's regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as \"(b)(2)-dietary ingredients.\" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA's regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as \"the compliance requirements.\"\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA's Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.12953585386276245", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4251098930835724", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement \"Not a significant source of ____\" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when \"circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply\" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, \"FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.\"\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the \"Not a significant source of ____\" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as \"Not a significant source of other nutrients\" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA's labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be \"packaged and sold individually,\" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement \"This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale\" or \"This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale\" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The \"principal display panel\" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The \"information panel\" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), \"Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber\"). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8755319118499756", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: GUIDANCE DOCUMENT\n\nGuidance for Industry: Exemptions from the Warning Label Requirement for Juice\n\nOCTOBER 2002\n\nFinal\n\nDocket Number: FDA-2001-D-0138 (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2001-D-0138).

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance document supercedes \"Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,\" September 18, 1998.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the Federal Register of July 8, 1998 (63 FR 37030), the Food and Drug Administration\n\n(FDA) published a final rule requiring a warning label on any juice that has not been\n\nprocessed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms that may be present\n\n(the \"juice labeling rule\"). In this guidance document, juice means any juice or juice\n\ningredient in a beverage, as defined by 21 CFR 120.1(a). Under 21 CFR 101.17(g), any juice or\n\njuice ingredient that is not processed to reduce pathogens by 100,000-fold (i.e., attain a 5-log\n\nreduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism) must bear a warning label. Becauselabeling may have limited effectiveness (i.e., it must be read and be understood), the warning label was intended to provide a measure of public safety until final Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations for juice could be established and implemented.\n\nIn the Federal Register of January 19, 2001 (66 FR 6138), FDA published a final rule requiring the application of HACCP principles to the processing of any juice or juice ingredient in a beverage (the \"juice HACCP rule\"). Juice produced in a retail establishment, i.e., a facility that produces juice that is only sold directly to consumers, is exempt from the HACCP requirements. Like the juice labeling rule, the juice HACCP rule utilizes the standard of a 5-log reduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism. Specifically, under $120.24(a), juice processors must establish control measures that will produce such a reduction.\n\nAfter the publication of the juice labeling rule, FDA's scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction evolved, as discussed in the preamble and as reflected in the requirements of the juice HACCP rule.\n\nPurpose of this Guidance\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide guidance to those juice processors not yet subject to the juice HACCP rule (e.g., small and very small processors who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule until January 21, 2003 and January 20, 2004, respectively) who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. This guidance document also provides guidance to processors at retail who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule and who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. FDA encourages those processors to operate consistently with this guidance in terms of 5-log pathogen reduction treatments because this guidance is based upon FDA's current scientific knowledge. In part, this guidance supercedes the previous 5-log pathogen reduction guidance in the juice labeling rule and FDA's guidance document, \"Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide\" (the \"small entity compliance guide\") (Ref. 1), because these documents no longer reflect FDA's current thinking.\n\nFDA Recommendations\n\nFDA's current scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction is based on information obtained from public meetings, discussions, comments to the juice HACCP proposed rule (63 FR 20450), and recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF) (Refs. 2 and 3). To assist juice processors in attaining a 5-log pathogen reduction consistent with current scientific knowledge, Table 1 compares FDA's previous and current recommendations for achieving the 5-log pathogen reduction. The following questions and answers provide additional guidance in terms of FDA's current recommendations for the 5-log reduction:Question: When in the process should the 5-log pathogen reduction treatment be applied? Answer: Based upon current scientific understanding, FDA recommends that the 5-log pathogen reduction and final product packaging occur under one firm's control, in a single production facility that is operating under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) and immediately before or immediately after packing. This recommendation is for both citrus and non-citrus juices. Although good agricultural practices (GAPs) and CGMPs at the farming and harvesting stages are encouraged, they should not be counted towards the 5-log pathogen reduction. The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6166). Question: What should be treated? Answer: FDA recommends that juice processors use treatments that directly contact all pathogens that may be present in or on the fruit or vegetables being processed. For most products, this means that the treatments should be performed on the juice after it is expressed. For citrus juices only, effective surface treatment of the citrus fruit may constitute direct contact with all pathogens, and thus, processors may consider counting such treatment toward the 5-log pathogen reduction. If surface treatments are used on citrus fruits to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction, FDA recommends that the treatment be applied to undamaged, tree-picked fruit (i.e., culled fruit that is U.S. Department of Agriculture choice or higher quality), that has been cleaned. (Note: There is no current USDA standard for choice or higher quality. FDA will consider undamaged tree-picked citrus fruit to meet the definition of \"culled\" for purposes of compliance with the juice HACCP regulation). The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6171).\n\nSummary\n\nSmall and very small processors (as defined in 21 CFR 120.1(b)) who do not treat their juice to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction should continue to comply with the juice labeling rule. All other juice processors are now required by the juice HACCP regulation (21 CFR Part 120) to apply HACCP principles to their processing operations and to have, in any resulting HACCP plan, measures to achieve a 5-log reduction in pathogens. Based upon FDA's current knowledge, processing juice in accordance with the recommendations in the small entity compliance guide for the juice labeling rule may not reduce pathogens to an acceptable level. Therefore, juice processors claiming exemption from the warning label requirement on the basis of the 5-log pathogen reduction provision of 21 CFR 101.17(g)(7) should consider the principles in this guidance. On August 31, 2001, FDA published a guidance document, \"The Juice HACCP Regulation: Questions and Answers\" to provide additional information on the juice HACCP rule, including assistance in achieving a 5-log pathogen reduction. As a follow-up to that document, FDA plans to publish additional information in question and answer format that processors may find useful, as well as additional guidance documents including, \"Guidancefor Industry: Juice HACCP Hazards and Control Guide\" and \"Guidance on Bulk Transport of Juice Concentrates and Certain Shelf Stable Juices.\" All documents will be available electronically.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] FDA, DHHS, \"Guidance for Industry: Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,\" September 18, 1998.\n\n[2] FSIS, USDA, \"National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi2\n\n[3] dhname=1999 register&docid=99-30222-filed),\" 64 FR 63281-63282, November 19, 1999.\n\n[4] NACMCF, \"National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food, Meeting on Fresh Citrus Juice; Transcript of Proceedings,\" December 8 to 9, 1999, public meeting.\n\nThe above guidance document supercedes the previous version dated December 21, 2001.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Exemptions from the Warning Label Requirement for Juice \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.07796049118042"]}
