Applicants should submit the letter of authorization provided to the applicant by the DMF holder which gives authorization to rely on the information in the DMF.34\n\nFootnote 34: 21 CFR 314.420(d). More information on DMFs, as well as the list of DMFs that FDA has received, is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/DrugMasterFilesDMFs/default.htm.\n\n1.12.4: Contains a statement, if applicable, that a request for a proprietary name has been made. An ANDA applicant requesting a proprietary name should submit that request when the ANDA is submitted to help ensure that an acceptable name is available at the time of approval. When requesting a proprietary name, a separate electronic submission should be made and identified as a \"REQUEST FOR PROPRIETARY NAME REVIEW.\"35\n\nFootnote 35: See the guidance for industry Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names (Rev.1).\n\nFootnote 36: Section 314.94(a)(3). See also the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n1.12.11: Contains the basis for submission.37 The applicant should provide: (1) the name of the RLD, (2) the application number of the RLD, and (3) the holder of the application for the RLD.\n\nIf the generic drug differs from the RLD in strength, route of administration, dosage form, or in that one active ingredient is substituted for one of the active ingredients in a listed combination drug product, applicants must first submit a suitability petition to FDA's Division of Dockets Management to obtain permission to file their ANDA.38 FDA will review the suitability petition to determine whether the requested change from the listed drug will impact the safety and effectiveness of the generic product and if any applicable requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act may be waived. The suitability petition must be approved by FDA before the ANDA is submitted.39 For an ANDA based on an approved petition under 21 CFR 10.30 or 314.93, the name of the RLD in section 1.12.11 must be the same as the listed drug in the petition, and section 1.12.11 must contain the FDA docket number for the petition and a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.40 When an applicant submits a petitioned ANDA, the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain (1) the name of the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned document number, and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.41({}^{,})42 When an ANDA applicant seeks approval of a generic drug that is a duplicate of adrug product in an approved petitioned ANDA (and for which the same drug has not been approved under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act), the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain: (1) the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, and RLD application number; (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned docket number; and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition. The first petitioned ANDA approved should be used for and identified in the appropriate sections of a subsequent ANDA as the reference standard. However, the RLD for that subsequent ANDA remains the listed drug referenced in the approved suitability petition.43\n\nFootnote 43: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\n1.12.12 Contains information demonstrating that the generic product is the same as the RLD.44_Same as_ means that the generic product is identical to the RLD in \"active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, except that conditions of use for which approval cannot be granted because of exclusivity or an existing patent may be omitted.\"45 To demonstrate that the proposed generic drug product meets this standard, applicants should provide:\n\nFootnote 44: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and \u00a7 314.94.\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nA statement that the conditions of use for the generic product have been previously approved for the RLD46\n\nFootnote 47: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\nInformation to show that the active ingredient(s) in the generic drug product is/are the same as the active ingredient(s) in the RLD47\n\nFootnote 48: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and \u00a7 314.94.\n\nFootnote 49: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nInformation to show that the route of administration, dosage form, and strength of the generic drug product are the same as those of the RLD48\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nAs applicable, information to indicate the strength of the generic drug product used in the in vivo bioequivalence (BE) studies (fasting and fed) to demonstrate BE of the generic drug product to the RLD\n\nFDA recommends that applicants submit, within their original application, all strengths that they intend to market.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for holders of Type II active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) drug master files (DMFs) that are or will be referenced in an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to an ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS (generic drug submissions). The guidance explains that, as of October 1, 2012, under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, commonly referred to as GDUFA:2\n\nFootnote 2: Public Law 112-144, Title III.\n\nDMF holders are required to pay a DMF fee when first authorizing the reference of their DMF in a generic application3 Footnote 3: For these purposes, such authorization is deemed to have occurred when the DMF \u201cis referenced on or after October 1, 2012, in a generic drug submission by an initial letter of authorization,\u201d Section 744B(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)(A).\n\nType II API DMFs must undergo an FDA completeness assessment (CA)\n\nThe guidance makes recommendations about the information that should be included in the DMF to facilitate a GDUFA CA. The guidance does not apply to Type II API DMFs used to support new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs),4 other submissions that are not generic drug submissions, or any other types of DMFs.5\n\nFootnote 4: Type II API, API intermediate, and drug product DMFs are not used to support BLAs submitted pursuant to sections 351(a) and 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nFootnote 5: See section 744A(7) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-41(7)).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nUnder GDUFA, beginning October 1, 2012, the holder of a Type II API DMF must pay a one-time DMF fee when the DMF is first referenced in a generic drug submission submitted to FDA on the basis of a letter of authorization (LOA) from the DMF holder.6 Also under GDUFA, holders of Type II API DMFs that were evaluated before October 1, 2012, must pay a one-time fee for the DMF when their DMF is first referenced in a new ANDA, an ANDA or PAS amendment, or an ANDA PAS on or after October 1, 2012.7 Only Type II API DMFs for use in generic drug submissions incur this one-time fee.\n\nFootnote 6: Section 744B(a)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)). For discussion of LOAs, see 21 CFR 314.420(b) and 314.50(g)(1).\n\nFootnote 7: The fee amount will be announced in the Federal Register not later than 60 days before the start of the fiscal year (generally on or about August 1 of the previous fiscal year).\n\nUnder GDUFA, Type II API DMFs intended for reference in a generic drug submission for which the fee is paid will undergo a CA. Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to make publicly available on its Web site a list of DMF numbers that correspond to DMFs that, having successfully undergone a CA in accordance with criteria to be published by FDA, are available for reference.\n\nAlthough the requirement for a CA for Type II API DMFs is new, FDA has previously evaluated DMFs in accordance with the criteria set out in the GDUFA Completeness Assessment Checklist for Type II API DMFs (CA Checklist), attached to this guidance as Appendix 1. In order to ensure adequate time for the CA, FDA strongly encourages the DMF holder to submit a complete DMF and pay the DMF fee at least 6 months prior to the submission of an ANDA or PAS that will rely on the DMF. When submitting a DMF, the DMF holder should also submit Form FDA 3794, the Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet, which includes the minimum information necessary for FDA to determine whether a DMF holder has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.8\n\nFootnote 8: See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM322676.pdf.\n\nDMF holders are encouraged to submit their DMFs using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format.9 More information is available on the eCTD format on FDA's Web site.10\n\nFootnote 9: Note that 24 months after the guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2013 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specification is finalized (i.e., May 5, 2017), DMFs will be required to be submitted using the eCTD format pursuant to the implementation timeline identified in the final guidance.\n\nFootnote 10: See information about electronic submissions at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\nFDA will perform a CA once a DMF holder files a Type II API DMF11 with the Form FDA 3794 and there is an initial verification of the fee payment. The CA does not replace the full scientific review, which determines whether the information contained in the DMF is adequate to support an ANDA regulatory action.\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s Web site on Drug Master Files at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/DrugMasterFilesDMFs/default.htm.\n\nIn brief, FDA will undertake a CA to determine the following:\n\nIs the DMF active?\n\nHas the fee been paid?\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed?\n\nDoes the DMF pertain to a single API?\n\nDoes the DMF contain certain administrative information?\n\nDoes the DMF contain all the information necessary to enable a scientific review?12\n\nFootnote 12: Id.\n\nIs the DMF written in English?13\n\nFootnote 13: If any part of the application is in a foreign language, an accurate and complete English translation shall be appended to such part. See 21 CFR 314.101(d)(5).\n\nFDA will conduct the CA by determining the answers to a series of questions listed in the CA Checklist, which is included in Appendix 1. DMFs for which the fee has been paid and which have been found complete in accordance with the criteria for a CA set out in the CA Checklist will be identified on FDA's public Web site as available for reference in support of a generic drug submission.\n\nFor complex APIs, in addition to the recommendations in the CA Checklist, DMF holders should ensure the DMF provides the data necessary for the Agency to review the DMF with respect to active ingredient sameness. Information on active ingredient sameness is discussed in the product's specific bioequivalence (BE) guidance when it becomes available on FDA's Web site.14\n\nFootnote 14: For example, for enoxaparin sodium: listed sameness equivalence criteria in the draft guidance include mode of depolymerization, source material, physicochemical properties, disaccharide building blocks, fragment mapping, sequence of oligosaccharide species, and biological and biochemical assays. If the appropriate product-specific data is not in the DMF, the DMF will be deemed incomplete.\n\nIn accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: \u201cActive\u201d is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.561609983444214", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: If the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee.

FDA will not receive - within the meaning of section 505(j)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act70 - a new ANDA or supplement submitted by that person, or any affiliate of that person, until the outstanding fee is paid.71\n\nFootnote 70: This provision references the \u201creceipt\u201d of ANDAs by FDA. The Agency evaluates an ANDA after it is submitted to determine whether it may be received. Receipt of an ANDA means that FDA has made a threshold determination that the ANDA is substantially complete; 21 CFR 314.101(b)(1).\n\nFootnote 71: Section 744B(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\n1 DMF Fees\n\nA DMF will be deemed available for reference if both the DMF fee is paid in full and the DMF has not failed an initial completeness assessment. No generic drug submission referencing the DMF will be received unless the fee is paid and the DMF is deemed available for reference.\n\nANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due but has not been paid will be provided notification of the DMF holder's failure to satisfy the user fee obligation. If the DMFfee is not paid within 20 calendar days after notification, the generic drug submission referencing the DMF will not be received.72\n\nFootnote 72: Section 744B(g)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 73: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 74: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 75: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 76: Section 744B(g)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix C ANDA Filing Fees\n\nIf an applicant does not submit payment of the ANDA filing fee within 20 calendar days of the due date, its application will be deemed incomplete on the date of submission and will not be received.73 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 73: Id.\n\nAppendix D Fee for API Information Not Included by Reference to DMF - (a)(3)(F) Fee\n\nIf a generic drug applicant submission contains information concerning the manufacture of an API at a facility by means other than reference by a letter of authorization to a Type II API DMF, and a fee equal to the DMF fee has not been previously paid with respect to such submission, then the applicant shall pay a fee in the amount described in section VII.D, in addition to the applicable ANDA filing fee.74 If these fees are not submitted within 20 calendar days of the due date then the submission will not be received.75 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 75: Id.\n\nAppendix E Facility Fees\n\nFailure to pay the facility fee within 20 calendar days of the due date will result in the following penalties:76\n\nFootnote 76: Id.\n\nNo new ANDA or supplement submitted by the person responsible for paying the fee or that person's affiliates will be received.\n\nNo new generic drug submission referencing the facility will be received until the fee is paid.\n\nThe facility will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nFDA will notify the referencing ANDA applicant of the facility's failure to satisfy its user fee obligations.\n\nFurther, all FDFs or APIs manufactured in the non-paying facility and all FDFs containing APIs manufactured in such a facility will be deemed misbranded.77 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nGDUFA Program Fees\n\nFailure to pay the GDUFA program fee within 20 calendar days of the GDUFA program fee due date will result in the following penalties:78\n\nFootnote 78: Section 744B(g)(5) of the FD&C Act.\n\nApplicants will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nAny ANDAs submitted by the applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will not be received.\n\nFurther, all drugs marketed pursuant to ANDAs held by such applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will be deemed misbranded.79 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nFootnote 79: Id.\n\nHowever, if an application or supplement was already received by FDA prior to the applicant being placed in arrears, FDA will continue the review of and accept amendments to those applications.\n\nXII Payment Information and Procedures\n\nThe payment process for GDUFA III is similar to the previous iterations of the program and other FDA user fees. The FDA website80 contains instructions for paying the fees.\n\nFootnote 80: https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/generic-drug-user-fee-amendments.\n\nPayment Procedures for GDUFA Fees\n\nThose responsible for payment of fees enter required information on FDA's User Fee System to generate a GDUFA cover sheet.\n\nThe cover sheet is designed to provide the minimum necessary information to determine if a person has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.\n\nThe cover sheet is submitted to FDA electronically generating a user fee payment identification number (PIN) to assist in tracking payment.\n\nCover sheets for ANDA filing fees should be submitted with ANDA submissions. The Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet and additional payment information is available on the GDUFA website (www.fda.gov/GDUFA).\n\nAcceptable Forms of Payment\n\nPayment must be made in U.S. currency drawn on a U.S. bank.81 Fee payers may pay online by credit card or Automated Clearing House (ACH) electronic check or send payment by check, bank draft, U.S. postal money order, or wire transfer.\n\nFootnote 81: See 87 FR 61601 (October 12, 2022), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-10-12/pdf/2022-22099.pdf.\n\nTimely Payment of Fees\n\nFDA's expectation is for full and timely payment of all GDUFA fees. Penalties associated with non-payment, including, but not limited to, refusal to receive a generic drug submission, drug product deemed misbranded, and failure of a DMF to be placed on a publicly available reference list, will apply until such obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nOne entity may pay GDUFA fees on behalf of another entity. Those paying fees are responsible for determining all financial institution transaction fees that may be deducted from an entity's authorized amount for payment to FDA. These include wire transfer and foreign exchange fees.\n\nRefund and \"Transfer\" Requests\n\nOther than as described in section VII.A, FDA will only fully refund payments of fees made in error. If a fee was properly incurred, there will be no refund of the payment.\n\nTo qualify for the return of a fee claimed to have been paid in error, a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request justifying such return within 180 calendar days after such fee was paid.82 The format for submitting refund requests is Form FDA 3913, attached as Appendix 1 and available at\n\nFootnote 82: Section 744B(m) of the FD&C Act.\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492188.pdf.\n\nA Form FDA 3913 written refund request should be submitted to the Division of User Fee Management at CDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFDA no longer permits the administrative action of applying a previously paid GDUFA fee (also referred to as a \"transfer\") from a closed-out fiscal year cover sheet to a different fiscal year cover sheet.83 Instead, payments from closed-out fiscal year cover sheets will only be processed as refunds to the original payors, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from when the original payment was made.\n\nRequests for the \"transfer\" of payments within the same fiscal year or open fiscal year may be permitted for the same fee type and for a fee obligation of the same payor, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from the original payment date. For example, a request to \"transfer\" a fee payment from a FY 2023 cover sheet to another FY 2023 cover sheetwithin the same fee type (perhaps due to an incorrect FEI) by the same payor will be processed, provided the request is made within 180 calendar days of the original payment date.\n\nAs another example, during September 2023 (FY 2023), an applicant may request a \"transfer\" of a fee to a FY 2024 cover sheet of the same fee type because FY 2023 has not yet been closed-out. However, if an applicant requests a \"transfer\" of a fee from a FY 2023 cover sheet during FY 2024 (beginning October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024), this transaction will not be permitted as FY 2023 has already been closed-out.\n\nTo request a \"transfer,\" applicants should complete Form FDA 3914 and email the form to\n\nCDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov. Form FDA 3914 is attached as Appendix 2 and is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492195.pdf\n--------------------\nContext title: Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.222951650619507", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: 23.8.25.2.11:14 & Drug Master Files: Guidelines I FDA\n\nVI. PROCESSING AND REVIEW POLICIES\n\nVI. A. Policies Related to Processing Drug Master Files\n\nVI. A.1.\n\nPublic availability of the information and data in a DMF is\n\ndetermined under 21 CFR Part 20, 21 CFR 314.420(e), and 21 CFR\n\n314.430.\n\nVI. A.2.\n\nAn original DMF submission will be examined on receipt to\n\ndetermine whether it meets minimum requirements for format and\n\ncontent. If the submission is administratively acceptable, FDA will\n\nacknowledge its receipt and assign it a DMF number.\n\nIf the submission is administratively incomplete or inadequate, it will be returned to the\n\nsubmitter with a letter of explanation from the Drug Master File Staff, and it will not be assigned a DMF number.\n\nVI. B. Drug Master File Review\n\nA DMF IS NEVER APPROY OR DISAPPROVED.\n\nThe agency will review information in a DMF only when an IND sponsor, an applicant for an\n\nNDA, ANDA, or Export Application, or another DMF holder incorporates material in the\n\nDMF by reference. As noted, the incorporation by reference must be accompanied by a copy\n\nof the DMF holder's letter of authorization.\n\nIf FDA reviewers find deficiencies in the information provided in a DMF, a letter describing\n\nthe deficiencies is sent to the DMF holder. At the same time, FDA will notify the person who\n\nrelies on the information in the deficient DMF that additional information is needed in the\n\nsupporting DMF. The general subject of the deficiency is identified, but details of the\n\ndeficiency are disclosed only to the DMF holder. When the holder submits the requested\n\ninformation to the DMF in response to the agency's deficiency letter, the holder should also\n\nsend a copy of the accompanying transmittal letter to the affected persons relying on the\n\nDMF and to the FDA reviewing division that identified the deficiencies. The transmittal letter\n\nwill provide notice that the deficiencies have been addressed.\n\n(\\blacktriangle)\n\nTop 0\n\nVII. HOLder obligations\n\nAny change or addition, including a change in authorization related to specific customers, should be submitted in duplicate and adequately cross referenced to previous submission(s). The reference should include the date(s), volume(s), section(s), and/or page number(s) affected.\n\nVII. A. Notice Required for Changes to a Drug Master File\n\nA holder must notify each affected applicant or sponsor who has referenced its DMF of any pertinent change in the DMF (21 CFR 314. 420(c)). Notice should be provided well before making the change in order to permit the sponsor/applicant to supplement or amend any affected application(s) as needed.\n\nVII. B. Listing of Persons Authorized To Refer to a Drug Master File\n\nVII. B.1.\n\nA DMF is required to contain a complete list of persons authorized to incorporate information in the DMF by reference [21 CFR 314.420(d)]. The holder should update the list in the annual update. The updated list should contain the holder's name, DMF number, and the date of the update. The update should identify by name (or code) the information that each person is authorized to incorporate and give the location of that information by date, volume, and page number.\n\nVII. B.2.\n\nAny person whose authorization has been withdrawn during the previous year should be identified under a suitable caption.\n\nVII. B.3.\n\nIf the list is unchanged on the anniversary date, the DMF holder should also submit a statement that the list is current.\n\nVII. C. Annual Update\n\nThe holder should provide an annual report on the anniversary date of the original submission. This report should contain the required list as described in B.1., and should also identify all changes and additional information incorporated into the DMF since the previousannual report on the subject matter of the DMF. If the subject matter of the DMF is unchanged, the DMF holder should provide a statement that the subject matter of the DMF is current. Failure to update or to assure FDA annually that previously submitted material and lists in the DMF remain current can cause delays in FDA review of a pending IND, NDA, ANDA, Export Application, or any amendment or supplement to such application; and FDA can initiate procedures for closure of the DMF (see Section IX).\n\nVII. D. Appointment of an Agent\n\nWhen an agent is appointed, the holder should submit a signed letter of appointment to the DMF giving the agent's name, address, and scope of responsibility (administrative and/or scientific). Domestic DMF holders do not need to appoint an agent or representative, although foreign DMF holders are encouraged to engage a U.S. agent.\n\nVII. E. Transfer of Ownership\n\nTo transfer ownership of a DMF to another party, the holder should so notify FDA and authorized persons in writing. The letter should include the following:\n\nName of transferee\n\nAddress of transferee\n\nName of responsible official of transferee\n\nEffective date of transfer\n\nSignature of the transferring official\n\nTypewritten name and title of the transferring official.\n\nThe new holder should submit a letter of acceptance of the transfer and an update of the information contained in the DMF, where appropriate. Any change relating to the new ownership (e.g., plant location and methods) should be included.\n\nVIII. Major Reorganization of a Drug Master File\n\nA holder who plans a major reorganization of a DMF is encouraged to submit a detailed plan of the proposed changes and request its review by the Drug Master File Staff. The staff should be given sufficient time to comment and provide suggestions before a major reorganization is undertaken.\n\nIX. Closure of a Drug Master File\n\nA holder who wishes to close a DMF should submit a request to the Drug Master File Staff stating the reason for the closure. See Section IV.D.5.a for the address.\n\nThe request should include a statement that the holder's obligations as detailed in Section VII have been fulfilled.\n\nThe Agency may close a DMF that does not contain an annual update of persons authorized to incorporate information in the DMF by reference and a list of changes made since the previous annual report. The holder will be notified of FDA's intent to close the DMF.\n\nMany of the guidelines referred to in the text and a current list of available guidelines may be obtained from the following:\n\nLegislative, Professional, and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFD-365)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nCopies of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be purchased from the following:\n\nSuperintendent of Documents\n\nU.S. Government Printing Office\n\nWashington, D.C. 20402\n\nDate updated: March 11, 2005\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2014-D-0397)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2014-D-0397\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2014-D-0397).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n\nTop (0\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Master Files- Guidelines \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.862697958946228", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: VII What are my responsibilities as a DMF holder?\n\nAs a DMF holder you have a number of obligations. Failure to meet these obligations may delay approval of applications that rely on the information in your DMF or result in the Agency closing your DMF. The following discusses your responsibilities.\n\nChanges to your DMF\n\nAny addition, deletion, or change to information in your DMF is required to be submitted to the Agency in duplicate (21 CFR 314.420(c)). This includes changes you formerly reported to the Agency under 21 CFR 314.70 when the information was part of an approved bulk application. The submission describing the change should include appropriate cross-references to the affected information in previous submissions, including the date(s), volume(s), section(s), and/or page number(s). Additionally, you must notify each person (applicant) authorized to reference information in your DMF of pertinent changes (21 CFR 314.420(c)). Notification should be provided well in advance to give the affected persons (applicants) ample time to amend or supplement their applications as necessary under 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nAnnual Update\n\nYou should update your DMF on an annual basis. The update should identify all changes and additional information incorporated into your DMF since the previous update. If no changes were made to your DMF, you should provide a statement that the information remains current. For more information on annual updates see CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\n\nListing of Persons Authorized to Reference your DMF\n\nYour DMF must contain a complete list of persons currently authorized to reference information in your DMF (21 CFR 314.420(d)). For more information on this topic see CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\nIf you have an appointed agent for your DMF, you should include a signed letter of appointment in your DMF that includes the agent's name, address, and scope of responsibility (administrative and/or scientific).\n\nAppendix E Transfer of Ownership\n\nIf you intend to transfer ownership of your DMF to another party, you should notify the Agency and persons authorized to reference the DMF (applicants) in writing. Details regarding information to be included in the letter are provided in CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\n\nAppendix F Incorporation of Information into a Dosage Form Application\n\nIf you do not wish to maintain a DMF, the information may be filed as part of one or more dosage form applications (IND, NDA, or ANDA). The dosage form applicant is then responsible for ensuring this information meets regulatory requirements. If the information is certified as being current and there have been no changes, it may be submitted to the dosage form application(s) as an annual report. If the information is not current or changes have been made, the DMF information should be filed as (1) a prior approval supplement, changes being effected supplement, or annual report for an NDA or ANDA or (2) an information amendment or annual report for an IND. The reporting category would depend on the nature of the change.\n\nGLOSSARY\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Master Files for Bulk Antibiotic Drug Substances Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.1383686512708664"], "According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: Consumer Antiseptic\n\nWash Final Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nJuly 2017\n\nOTC\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nConsumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Regulatory Policy and Division of Nonprescription Drug Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing that certain active ingredients used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE), and thus, are ineligible for inclusion in the OTC topical antiseptic monograph. On September 6, 2016, FDA published a final rule that finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, which are intended for use in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products (81 FR 61106) (Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule). Three active ingredients-- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- were deferred from the final rule to allow more time for sponsors who proposed to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. These deferrals are for one year, subject to renewal if adequate progress is made in filling the data gaps.\n\nThe final rule applies to consumer antiseptic wash products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, including consumer hand washes and consumer body washes. No additional safety or effectiveness data were submitted to support monograph conditions for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. Therefore, with the exception of the three deferred active ingredients, this rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of the remaining 19 active ingredients which are found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing one or more of these non-GRASE active ingredients will be considered new drugs for which approved new drug applications (NDAs) are required for marketing (21 USC 355(a)). The Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is effective September 6, 2017.\n\nFDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)2 to assist small businesses in complying with the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 2: 5 U.S.C. 601 (note).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe final rule finalizes the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Proposed Rule published in the Federal Register of December 17, 2013 (78 FR 76444) (2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR) and amends the 1994 tentative final monograph (TFM) for OTC antiseptic drug products that published in the Federal Register of June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31402) (the 1994 TFM). The final rule is part of FDA's ongoing rulemaking to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products marketed in the United States on or before May 1972 (OTC Drug Review). The Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is one of three OTC topical antiseptic rules involving triclosan required to be published pursuant to a Consent Decree entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 21, 2013, in Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. V. United States Food and Drug Administration, et al., 10 Civ. 569 (S.D.N.Y.).\n\nAs explained in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, new information on potential risks posed by the use of certain consumer antiseptic washes prompted us to reevaluate the data needed for classifying consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients as generally recognized as effective (GRAE). As a result, we proposed that the risk from the use of a consumer antiseptic wash drug product must be balanced by a demonstration -- through studies that demonstrate a direct clinical benefit (i.e., a reduction of infection) -- that the product is superior to washing with nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. In the final rule, we determined that the data and information submitted for 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients were insufficient to demonstrate that there is any additional benefit from the use of these active ingredients in consumer antiseptic wash products compared to nonantibacterial soap and water. Consequently, we found that the available data do not support a GRAE determination for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nAs also explained in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, several important scientific developments that affect the safety evaluation of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients have occurred since FDA's 1994 evaluation of the safety of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients under the OTC Drug Review. New data suggest that the systemic exposure to some of these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure is now available. New safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use could have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, to support a classification of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, we proposed that additional safety data are needed to demonstrate that these ingredients meet current safety standards. We determined in the final rule that the available information and published data for 19 active ingredients were insufficient to establish the safety of long-term, daily repeated exposure to these active ingredients for use in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nConsequently, we found that the available data do not support a GRAS determination for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nThe final rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarbon, which are intended for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. As explained, either no additional data were submitted or the data and information that were submitted were not sufficient to support monograph conditions for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash ingredients. Therefore, in the final rule, we found that these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients are not GRASE. Accordingly, consumer antiseptic wash drug products that contain one or more of these 19 active ingredients are misbranded under section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 352) and are considered new drugs under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355) and part 314 (21 CFR part 314) of the Code of Federal Regulations are required for marketing.\n\nIn response to several comments submitted to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, FDA has deferred further rulemaking on three specific active ingredients used in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products to allow for the development and submission of new safety and effectiveness data to the record for these ingredients. The deferred active ingredients are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol. Accordingly, FDA does not make a GRASE determination for these three active ingredients in the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule. The monograph or new drug status of these three ingredients will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a future date if these studies are not completed.\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nIn the final rule, we found that there are 22 active ingredients eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use as a consumer antiseptic wash. An OTC drug is covered by the OTC Drug Review if its conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464).3 As noted above, three of these active ingredients have been deferred from this rulemaking.

The deferred active ingredients are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol. Accordingly, FDA does not make a GRASE determination for these three active ingredients in the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule. The monograph or new drug status of these three ingredients will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a future date if these studies are not completed.\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nIn the final rule, we found that there are 22 active ingredients eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use as a consumer antiseptic wash. An OTC drug is covered by the OTC Drug Review if its conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464).3 As noted above, three of these active ingredients have been deferred from this rulemaking. The 19 remaining ingredients found eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use in consumer antiseptic wash products and subject to this final rule are:\n\nClofilucarban\n\nFluorosalan\n\nHexachlorophene\n\nHexylresorcinol\n\nIodophors (Iodine-containing ingredients)\n\nIodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)\n\nIodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)\n\nNonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine\n\nPoloxamer-iodine complex\n\nUndecoylium chloride iodine complex\n\nMethylbenzetmonium chloride\n\nPhenol4 Footnote 4: Although phenol is listed twice in the final rule as \u201cgreater than 1.5 percent\u201d and \u201cless than 1.5 percent\u201d, phenol\u2014regardless of concentration\u2014is eligible for the OTC Drug Review but was found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nSecondary amyltricresols\n\nSodium oxychlororesene\n\nTribromsalan\n\nTriclocarban\n\nTricosan\n\nTriple dye Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn the final rule, we also found certain other active ingredients ineligible for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic wash because insufficient information was submitted to show that their conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972. FDA considers a drug that is ineligible for inclusion in the OTC monograph system to be a new drug that will require FDA approval through the NDA process (21 CFR Part 314). The ineligible active ingredients are:\n\nAlcohol (ethyl alcohol)\n\nBenzalkonium cetyl phosphate\n\nCetylpyridinium chloride\n\nChlorhexidine gluconate\n\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\nPolyhexamethylene biguanide\n\nSalicylic acid\n\nSodium hypochlorite\n\nTea tree oil\n\nCombination of potassium vegetable oil solution, phosphate sequestering agent, and triethanolamine\n\n1 Q2. What antiseptic products are covered by the final rule?\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule covers the group of products referred to as \"consumer antiseptic washes.\" Consumer antiseptic washes include a variety of personal care products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, such as antibacterial soaps, antibacterial hand washes, and antibacterial body washes. These products may be used by the general population for personal use in the home and public settings on a frequent, daily basis.\n\nThis final rule does not cover or have an impact on the monograph status of other OTC antiseptic products, including: (1) consumer antiseptic rubs, which are products that are not rinsed off after use such as hand rubs (i.e., \"hand sanitizers\") and antibacterial wipes; (2) health care antiseptic, which are antiseptic products that are intended for use by health care professionals in a hospital setting or other health care situations outside the hospital; (3) first aid antisetics; and (4) antisetics used by the food industry. The monograph status of the active ingredients intended for use in these other OTC antiseptic products will be addressed separately.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ3. What is the significance of triclosan and triclocarban under this final rule?\n\nBased on available data, triclosan and triclocarban have been two of the most widely used OTC consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients on the market -- with triclosan being used primarily in liquid antiseptic soaps and triclocarban being used primarily in bar antiseptic soaps. Emerging research shows that some antibacterial ingredients could pose health risks. For example, some data suggest that triclosan and triclocarban can cause alterations in thyroid, reproductive growth, and developmental systems of neonatal and adolescent animals. Because consumer antiseptic washes are chronic use products, evaluation of the potential for chronic toxicity and the effects on reproduction and development are essential to the safety assessment of these active ingredients.\n\nAs explained in the final rule, insufficient data were submitted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of triclosan and triclocarban for use as a consumer antiseptic wash product, and thus, we found that triclosan and triclocarban are not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Accordingly, to continue marketing as of the effective date of the final rule, OTC consumer antiseptic wash products containing triclosan or triclocarban will require (1) reformulation to remove triclosan or triclocarban and relabeling of the reformulated products; or (2) approval of a new drug application.\n\nWhen and how do manufacturers have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is effective September 6, 2017. In the final rule we found active ingredients to be either ineligible for inclusion in the OTC monograph system or not to be GRASE. On or after September 6, 2017, any OTC consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing such ingredients are misbranded and cannot be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved NDA. This means that manufacturers will need to obtain an NDA to market consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing any of these 19 active ingredients. Alternatively, manufacturers of consumer antiseptic washes containing nonmonograph antiseptic active ingredients can comply with this final rule by removing the products from the market or reformulating those products to remove the nonmonograph antiseptic active ingredient and marketing the products as soaps or washes without antibacterial claims.\n\nWhat are the effectiveness criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n\nFDA's OTC regulations (21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(ii)) define the standards for establishing an OTC active ingredient as GRAE. These regulations require the effectiveness of active ingredients for OTC drug products be demonstrated by controlled clinical trials (SSSS 330.10(a)(4)(ii) and 314.126(b)), unless this requirement is waived as provided in SS 330.10(a)(4)(ii). These studies must be well controlled and able to distinguish the effect of a drug from other influences, such as a spontaneous change in the course of the disease, placebo effect, or biased observation (SS 314.126(a)).\n\nThe controlled clinical trials required by FDA's regulations are intended to demonstrate that the pharmacological effect of the drug when used under adequate directions for use will provide clinically significant relief of the type claimed, i.e., efficacy for the stated indication.\n\nAccordingly, to demonstrate the GRAE status of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, the effectiveness criteria include conducting adequate clinical outcome studies that identify the conditions of use on which an antiseptic active ingredient can demonstrate a reduction in the number of infections. Specifically, the risk from the use of a consumer antiseptic wash drug product must be balanced by a demonstration -- through studies that demonstrate a direct clinical benefit (i.e., a reduction of infection) -- that the product is superior to washing with nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. To determine that the active ingredient is GRAE, the clinical outcome studies should include at least two arms: the final formulation of the product and the vehicle. The effectiveness of the active ingredient, and hence its contribution in the reduction of infection, is determined by comparing the infection rate in a consumer population washing with the antiseptic product that contains the active ingredient in question to the infection rate in a consumer population washing with the vehicle alone.\n\nThe requirement for clinical outcome studies is based on the fact that there are insufficient data to demonstrate a direct benefit from the use of consumer antiseptic washes compared to nonantibacterial soap and water. The log reduction standard (a clinical simulation standard) proposed in the 1994 TFM, which was based on a non-validated surrogate endpoint (i.e., number of bacteria removed from the skin), is insufficient for establishing the effectiveness of consumer antiseptic washes. In addition, existing data cannot demonstrate a correlation between log reductions of bacteria achieved by antiseptic hand washing in surrogate testing and the reduction of infection. Thus, in consumer settings where soap and water are readily available, the benefit of using an antiseptic wash product must be supported by these clinical outcome studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.760577201843262", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: Accordingly, to demonstrate the GRAE status of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, the effectiveness criteria include conducting adequate clinical outcome studies that identify the conditions of use on which an antiseptic active ingredient can demonstrate a reduction in the number of infections.

In addition, existing data cannot demonstrate a correlation between log reductions of bacteria achieved by antiseptic hand washing in surrogate testing and the reduction of infection. Thus, in consumer settings where soap and water are readily available, the benefit of using an antiseptic wash product must be supported by these clinical outcome studies.\n\nIn addition to the clinical outcome studies, the effectiveness criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients include an in vitro study consisting of a modified time-kill assay that must be conducted with selected reference organisms and their respective clinical isolates, which are representative of bacterial strains most commonly encountered in general consumer settings. The purpose of the in vitro study is to characterize the antimicrobial activity of the active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nWhat are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n\nAs explained in the rulemaking, the safety data needed to make a GRAS determination for active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic washes are based on several important scientific developments that affect the safety evaluation of these active ingredients. New data suggest that the systemic exposure to these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure has become available. Moreover, new safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use can have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, the safety data needed to demonstrate safety for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients fall into three broad categories: (1) safety data studies in current FDA guidance (e.g., preclinical and human pharmacokinetic studies (including maximal use trials, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies); (2) data to characterize potential hormonal effects; and (3) data to evaluate the development of resistance. These data requirements are the minimum data necessary to establish the safety of long-term, daily, repeated exposure to antiseptic active ingredients used in consumer wash products (81 FR 61106 at 61107).\n\nWhy did FDA find the 19 active ingredients to be not GRASE?\n\nWith respect to effectiveness, in the final rule we found that the data and information submitted for the 19 active ingredients were insufficient to demonstrate that there was any additional benefit from the use of these active ingredients in consumer antiseptic wash products compared to nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. Consequently, we found that the available data did not support a GRAE determination for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nWith respect to safety, in the final rule we found that the available information and published data for the 19 active ingredients were insufficient to establish the safety of long-term, daily repeated exposure to these active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consequently, we found that the available data did not support a GRAS determination for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nWhat information did FDA rely on to make its GRASE Determinations?\n\nFDA issued this final rule based on its evaluation of the available information, including the published literature, the received comments, and all the data that were submitted to the rulemaking on the safety and effectiveness of the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. The decisions in the final rule are also based on the recommendations of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee,5 as well as recommendations from other public meetings held by the Agency on antiseptics.\n\nFootnote 5: See transcript of the January 22, 1997, Meeting of the Joint Nonprescription Drugs and Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committees, OTC.

Available at https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4184T1.pdf.\n\nWhy did FDA not address final formulation testing or labeling in this final rule\n\nWe did not address final product formulation testing or labeling requirements in this final rule because none of the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients that are the subject of this final rule were found to be GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Final formulation testing and labeling for the deferred ingredients may be addressed in the future once their GRASE determination is concluded.\n\nWhy were three consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients deferred from this final rule?\n\nAs explained in the final rule, we understood that, in certain circumstances, planning, implementing, and analyzing the data generated from the safety and effectiveness studies can be a time-consuming process that may not be completed within the period granted for submission of additional data in response to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR (78 FR 76444).\n\nAccordingly, in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, we provided a process for seeking an extension of time to submit the required safety and effectiveness data if needed. We stated that we would consider all the data and information submitted to the record in conjunction with all timely and completed requests to extend the timeline to finalize the monograph status for a given ingredient. Consideration for deferral for an ingredient was given to requests with clear statements of intent to conduct the necessary studies required to fill all the data gaps identified in the proposed rule for that ingredient.\n\nAfter analyzing the data and information submitted related to the requests for extensions, we determined that deferral was warranted for three consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients -- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- to allow more time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. Thus, these three active ingredients are not included in the final rule and will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a later date if these studies are not completed.\n\nWhat is the deferral time period for these three ingredients?\n\nFDA deferred rulemaking on benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol for 1 year. These deferrals are subject to renewal to permit sponsors to conduct the necessary studies to address the data gaps. On March 24, 2017, we renewed these deferrals for another 1-year period, subject to renewal. If the studies in progress do not appear, in FDA's judgment, to be productive, the Agency expects that it will proceed to rulemaking for these ingredients after this deferral stage.\n\nTo facilitate this process, as laid out in the deferral letters, sponsors submitted clear statements of intent to conduct all necessary studies and submitted full study outcomes reports to the public docket. Further detail on the necessary studies, including FDA's guidance on study objectives and design for certain studies, can be found on the Agency's Antiseptic FDA Letters website available at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/ucm538131.htm.\n\nWhere can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule should be directed to CDERCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.

Under 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as category III in a tentative final monograph (TFM), including the 1994 TFM for over-the-counter topical antiseptic (59 FR 31402) - as further amended by the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub proposed rule (81 FR 42912) - are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM and comply with all other applicable requirements for nonprescription drugs.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR covers OTC consumer antiseptic - rub products - that are sometimes - referred to as rubs, leave-on products, or hand sanitizers. The Consumer AntisepticRub FR also covers OTC consumer antiseptic - wipes. These products are intended to be used when soap and water are not available - and are left on and not rinsed off with water.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR does not address the monograph - status of other OTC antiseptic - products, including: (1) consumer antiseptic - washes, which are personal care products - that are intended - for use with water and are rinsed off after use, such as antibacterial - soaps, antibacterial - hand washes, and antibacterial - body - washes; (2) health care antiseptic, which are antiseptic - products that are intended for use by health care professionals - in a hospital setting or other health care situations - outside of the hospital; (3) first aid antiseptic, - which are skin antiseptic, skin-wound - cleansers, and skin-wound - protectants used primarily - by consumers for first aid use; and (4) antiseptic - used by the food industry. - The monograph - status of the active ingredients - intended for use in these other OTC antiseptic - products - has been and/or will be addressed separately.\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR?\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, we found that three active ingredients - were eligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review for use in a consumer antiseptic - rub. The three ingredients - are:\n\nEthyl alcohol\n\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\nAs noted above, FDA temporarily - deferred - a final determination - regarding the GRAS/GRAE - status of these three active ingredients - to allow time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill - the safety and effectiveness data gaps - identified - for these ingredients.\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, we also found 28 active ingredients - ineligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic - rub.

On or after the April 13, 2020, effective date of the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, any OTC consumer antiseptic - rub drug product containing - one or more of the 28 ingredients - that FDA has found ineligible - cannot be introduced or delivered for introduction - into interstate commerce unless the drug product is the subject of an approved NDA or ANDA. This means that manufacturers will need to obtain an NDA or ANDA to market consumer antiseptic - rub drug products containing - any of these 28 active ingredients. Alternatively, manufacturers of consumer antiseptic - rubs containing - antiseptic - active ingredients - can comply with the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR by removing their products from the market, or reformulating - them to remove the ineligible - active ingredients, - and then marketing - them appropriately (e.g., by substituting - one of the three active ingredients - described above or by marketing - the products as antiseptic-free - rubs or wipes without drug claims).\n\nWhat if my OTC antiseptic product uses an active ingredient not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub final rule?\n\nOTC consumer antiseptic - rub or wipe products containing - active ingredients not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR are considered new drugs, for which an approved NDA or ANDA is required before marketing such products. Manufacters of such products can also pursue one of the alternatives - explained in Q3 to comply - with this final rule.\n\nWhy did FDA not address final formulation - testing or labeling in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR?\n\nWe did not address final product formulation - testing or labeling - requirements in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR because none of the consumer antiseptic - rub active ingredients - that are the subject of the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR were found to be GRAS/GRAE - for use in consumer antiseptic - rub products.

FDA specifically requests that sponsors provide the following information:\n\nA summary of all potentially associated serious adverse drug experiences.\n\nA summary of all available potentially associated nonserious adverse drug experiences.\n\nA summary of expected or frequently reported side effects, whether serious or nonserious.\n\nCopies of all available reports of potentially associated serious adverse drug experiences. Each report submitted should be in the form of an individual case safety report as described in 21 CFR 314.80 and refer only to an individual consumer or to a single attached publication.\n\nAny available safety information from studies of safety and effectiveness in humans.\n\nRelevant medical literature describing associated adverse events.\n\nEnglish translations should be provided for all foreign language materials.\n\nFor products marketed outside the United States, submissions should also state whether each country's system allows for adverse event reporting and, if so, how each country's system identifies and collects the adverse event information.30 If adverse event information is not available from all countries where the active ingredient has been marketed in OTC sunscreen products, the sponsor should provide an explanation for the missing data. It is important to note, however, that even when countries have an adverse event reporting system that includes sunscreen products, underreporting is a significant limitation of any system that depends on spontaneous reports.\n\nFootnote 30: See, e.g., 21 CFR 330.14(c)(2)(v).\n\nMany factors can influence whether an adverse event is reported, including whether a possible relationship between the event and an ingredient or product is recognized by consumers or health care providers. For example, adverse events that occur many years after a causal drug exposure may not be recognized as being related to that exposure, especially if the background rate of those adverse events is high (e.g., a common cancer or a developmental problem). Thus, an absence of reports does not necessarily equate to an absence of adverse events. Despite the limitations of adverse event reporting, FDA considers postmarketing data to be relevant both tothe overall GRASE assessment of OTC sunscreen active ingredients and to labeling considerations because these data may reveal safety signals not otherwise observed in clinical or nonclinical testing.\n\nIV Effectiveness Data\n\nFDA's OTC drug regulations generally identify both the types of effectiveness information that sponsors should submit as evidence that a drug product containing an active ingredient or other OTC drug condition could be GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2)) and the standard by which effectiveness is to be judged, which requires controlled clinical investigations to support effectiveness (SS 330.10(a)(4)(ii)).\n\nWhen applying these regulations to each potential sunscreen active ingredient, FDA requests that sponsors provide evidence from at least two adequate and well-controlled SPF studies showing that the active ingredient effectively prevents sunburn, because sunburn prevention is the minimum indication for an OTC sunscreen product. Two adequate and well-controlled SPF studies of the active ingredient at a lower concentration than the maximum requested should be conducted according to established standards.31 These SPF studies should demonstrate that the selected concentration provides an SPF value of 2 or higher.\n\nFootnote 31: FDA expects that the upper bound of any concentration of the active ingredient ultimately established would be governed by the safety data, as well as by efficacy.\n\nThe current standard procedure for SPF testing is described in SS 201.327(i) (21 CFR 201.327(i)).32 Any new SPF tests for a particular ingredient should be performed as described in these regulations, using a test formulation containing the ingredient as the only active ingredient to identify its contribution to the overall SPF test results. These tests should also include a vehicle control arm to rule out any contribution the vehicle may have had on the SPF test results. Finally, as described in SS 201.327(i), an SPF standard formulation comparator arm should be another component of the study design.\n\nFootnote 32: Although this SPF testing procedure is used primarily for final formulation testing of finished products marketed without approved NDAs, it is equally applicable for determining whether or not a sunscreen active ingredient is generally recognized as effective as part of the overall GRASE determination.\n\nCurrent sunscreen testing and labeling regulations in SS 201.327(j) also specify a broad spectrum testing procedure, which provides an in vitro measurement of a sunscreen product's ability to protect against both ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B radiation. Broad spectrum protection is often the result of the combined contribution of multiple active ingredients in a final sunscreen formulation; thus, FDA does not expect that a sunscreen active ingredient would undergo broad spectrum effectiveness testing to establish its effectiveness for a GRASE determination for use in OTC sunscreen products.\n\nUnder SS 201.327, the determination of whether an individual sunscreen product subject to that regulation may be labeled as broad spectrum (and therefore bear the additional claims related to that labeling) is made on a product-specific basis, applying the standard testing methods set forth in those regulations.33 If a sunscreen active ingredient evaluated under the SIA is established to be GRASE for use in nonprescription sunscreens, the final sunscreen order can address broad spectrum testing and related labeling conditions for final sunscreen formulations containing that ingredient.\n\nFootnote 33: These standard testing methods are also described in the guidance for industry Labeling and Effectiveness Testing: Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-The-Counter Human Use\u2014Small Entity Compliance Guide.\n\nV Anticipated final formulation testing\n\nThe preceding sections of this guidance have concentrated on recommendations for safety and effectiveness data needed to support FDA's determination that a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE for use in sunscreens. FDA's determination that an active ingredient is GRASE will be made in the form of a final sunscreen order that will set out the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see section I).34 As noted in section III.1.2, variations among individual sunscreen products--and in particular, aspects of the lotion or other vehicle in which active ingredients are delivered -- can affect their absorption and thus their safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 34: See section 586D(e) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTo address the variability among sunscreen formulations, FDA currently requires final formulation testing of nonprescription sunscreen products to ensure their effectiveness--namely, testing for SPF value as well as broad spectrum protection and water resistance where those attributes are claimed in product labels.35 FDA anticipates that final sunscreen orders issued for sunscreen active ingredients determined to be GRASE under the SIA will also include conditions requiring final formulation testing to ensure the safety of all sunscreen formulations permitted by the order.\n\nFootnote 35: See \u00a7 201.327 for the current requirements for OTC sunscreens containing the active ingredients already evaluated under the monograph system. OTC sunscreens marketed under NDAs provide similar information in their product-specific applications to substantiate their labeling.\n\nThe discussion that follows provides FDA's current thinking about such final formulation safety testing, to be conducted in the future. Note that FDA has not yet determined what particular final formulation testing, if any, will be specified in future final sunscreen orders for any given sunscreen active ingredient. Such requirements will be established on an ingredient-specific basis, taking into consideration the data recommended to be supplied under other parts of this guidance to support a GRASE determination (e.g., whether any safety signals are detected in well-conducted nonclinical carcinogenicity and DART studies). Interested parties can provide relevant information and comments regarding final formulation testing for an individual sunscreen active ingredient as part of the GRASE determination process for that ingredient.\n\nFDA's current thinking is that final formulation safety testing of nonprescription sunscreens would not generally call for an in vivo study. Instead, FDA expects that the conditions of marketing specified for sunscreen active ingredients in final sunscreen orders would require manufacturers to perform in vitro permeation testing before marketing each new formulation.36 Consistent with the approach for final formulation efficacy testing required by SS 201.327, FDA anticipates that it would not review the results of the in vitro final formulation safety testing before product marketing. Rather, FDA expects that final sunscreen orders would require manufacturers to maintain records of this testing; these records would be available to FDA.\n\nFootnote 36: FDA recommends this approach as an alternative to final in vivo (MUsT) testing of final product formulations, which was recommended by the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee (see the response to Discussion Question 2 in the 2014 NDAC Minutes, supra note 15, at 7).\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products \u2013 Safety and Effectiveness Data \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.141345024108887", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA's specific recommendations on the data and information needed to support a positive GRASE determination under the SIA are detailed in sections II (pharmaceutical quality/manufacturing information), III (safety data), and IV (effectiveness data). Section V presents FDA's current thinking on an approach to safety testing of final sunscreen formulations that it anticipates adopting in the future.\n\nAlthough sunscreen products are typically formulated with two or more active ingredients, the recommendations in sections II through IV generally contemplate that testing will be performed using formulations including one active ingredient FDA anticipates that these data would also generally be sufficient to assess whether, and under what conditions, that active ingredient is GRASE for use as part of a combination of sunscreen active ingredients. In some situations, additional data and testing beyond what is recommended in this guidance may be needed to support a positive GRASE determination and to establish the associated conditions for a particular active ingredient. The following are examples in which additional data may be needed:\n\nData suggest that there may be a safety or efficacy concern with a particular combination of active ingredients or active and inactive ingredients\n\nInformation indicates that an active ingredient is unstable when exposed to sunlight and suggests that the active ingredient may need to be combined with a photostabilizer to be safe or effective\n\nOther situations may occur in which additional data are needed (see, e.g., section III for some additional examples). Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA any questions about whether additional data may be needed for a particular active ingredient.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Pharmaceutical Quality/Manufacturing Information\n\nFDA needs information that sufficiently characterizes the identity of each sunscreen active ingredient for FDA reviewers to determine how, if at all, the safety and efficacy studies submitted for review are relevant to the ingredient for which GRASE determination is sought.10 This information would also be needed to appropriately characterize the active ingredient in the final sunscreen order. Sponsors should provide the compendial status of the ingredient, including reference to a United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary monograph. Sponsors should also provide any known chemical and/or manufacturing characteristics of the active ingredient that may be relevant to FDA's GRASE evaluation and to the establishment of the conditions of any resulting final sunscreen order.11 Such information should include known interactions with other sunscreen active ingredient(s) or commonly used sunscreen vehicle component(s) and particle size information for micronized or nanoscale active ingredients. In addition, sponsors should describe any aspects of formulation that are needed to ensure stability, or other characteristics of the active ingredient that are needed to establish conditions under which it is GRASE for use in sunscreens.\n\nFootnote 11: The determination of whether a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE and not misbranded also requires the Agency to describe the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see, e.g., section 586C(e) of the FD&C Act; see also section V of this document).\n\n3 Safety Data\n\nFDA's OTC drug regulations identify both the general types of safety information that sponsors should submit as evidence that an OTC drug is GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(2))) and the standard by which such safety information is to be judged (SS 330.10(a)(4)(i)). When applying these regulations to a given active ingredient, FDA uses its scientific expertise to determine what constitutes \"adequate tests by methods reasonably applicable to show the drug is safe under the prescribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use.\"12\n\nFootnote 12: \u00a7 330.10(a)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recognizes the contribution that broad spectrum sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) value of 15 or higher can make to decrease the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun if used as directed with other sun protection measures. To protect the public health, it is also important for FDA to balance the potential benefits of these sunscreen products to consumers against their potential risks. Providing an adequate safety margin13 for OTC sunscreen active ingredients and finished sunscreen products is a key element of FDA's risk assessment. When determining the specific testing and other data needed to adequately demonstrate that an OTC sunscreen active ingredient is safe, FDA considers both the circumstances under which OTC sunscreen products are intended to be used by consumers and current scientific knowledge and assessment technology.\n\nFootnote 13: For drugs with a known potential for adverse effects based on animal data, the anticipated level of risk for humans may be quantified using a safety margin calculation. A safety margin calculation takes the highest animal no observed adverse effect level and estimates a maximum safe level of exposure for humans. One caveat to the safety margin calculation is that animal studies do not always predict effects in humans, and the actual threshold for an effect in humans may be different (higher or lower) than in the species tested. The human sensitivity to a drug is often unknown. To account for this, the predicted safe exposure level in humans that is reflected in the safety margin is well below where toxicities were seen in animals.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nHuman dermal safety studies for topical products in which exposure to light after application is anticipated generally consist of two sets of studies--those conducted without specific exposure to light and those conducted to assess reactions after ultraviolet exposure (photosafety studies).17 These study sets usually consist of dermal irritation patch testing, dermal sensitization patch testing, dermal phototoxicity testing, and dermal photoallergenicity testing.\n\nFootnote 17: See the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidancCompilanceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nBecause marketed sunscreen products typically contain a combination of active ingredients and because brand name product formulations frequently change, it is difficult for FDA to determine causal links between individual active ingredients and reported irritation and hypersensitivity adverse events associated with a particular product. Therefore, FDA generally expects to use data from human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and human photosafety studies, in conjunction with postmarketing adverse event data, to inform GRASE determinations and labeling. Nonetheless, in some cases, depending on the rigor of available postmarketing safety information, it may be reasonable for sponsors to omit human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and/or human photosafety studies. For example, if FDA concludes that there is a positive risk-benefit for a sunscreen active ingredient but that it is known to be a sensitizer, it may be possible to develop safety labeling to address this risk without data generated in the human dermal safety studies described below. Sponsors who believe there is a scientific rationale that may preclude the need for some or all of the described studies are urged to contact FDA before initiating studies.\n\na. Human irritation and sensitization studies\n\nStudies of skin irritation and sensitization that use the repeat insult patch test or other relevant tests are recommended elements in FDA's safety evaluation of topical drug products that, like sunscreens, are applied to the skin repeatedly over long periods of time. These tests, which are designed to detect the potential of topical drug products for local dermatologic events with fewer subjects than might be observed in larger clinical trials, often involve applying product more frequently and/or for longer durations than the proposed clinical dosing of those drug products. In dermal irritation studies, a test substance is applied to a small pad (patch) and affixed to the test subject's skin, usually on the back, to determine whether the ingredient causes direct skin toxicity. Dermal sensitization studies are conducted similarly but are designed to detect immunologically mediated reactions, which require prior exposure to the allergen.\n\nNonprescription sunscreen active ingredients, when found to be GRASE, may be used in numerous, as yet unknown, product formulations. Therefore, FDA recommends that cumulative irritation studies evaluate (1) the proposed sunscreen active ingredient at the highest concentration for which a GRASE determination is sought, in an appropriate vehicle; (2) the vehicle alone; (3) a negative control; and (4) a positive control. The evaluation should include scoring of erythema, edema, and a popular response or skin erosion.\n\nSkin sensitization studies, conducted to detect immunologically mediated reactions, should be conducted in the following three phases:\n\nThe induction phase (three weekly applications for 3 weeks)\n\nThe rest phase (no product application for 10 to 14 days)\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products \u2013 Safety and Effectiveness Data \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.643611431121826"], "With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: To help ensure the accuracy of records retained, we recommend that establishments that make an ACTP available for distribution obtain records directly from the creator of such documents whenever possible (e.g., serology/microbiology results should be obtained directly from the testing laboratory). All records should be in English or, if in another language, should be retained and translated to English and accompanied by a statement of authenticity by the translator that specifically identifies the translated document so that compliance with CGMP can be more easily determined by FDA.\n\nRecords Management System\n\nYou should establish and maintain a records management system relating to CGMP. Under this system, you should maintain records pertaining to a specific ACTP in such a way as to facilitate review of the ACTP's history before making it available for distribution and, if necessary, after the ACTP's release, as part of a follow-up evaluation or investigation. You should also maintain and organize records pertinent to the manufacture of the ACTP (e.g., labeling and packaging procedures, and equipment logs). If you maintain records in more than one location, you should design the records management system to ensure prompt identification, location, and retrieval of all records. You should organize your records in a useful manner in accordance with this section.\n\nExample: A recovery establishment under contract with a processor sends ACTPs to the processor. The recovery establishment should send all relevant records, including donor records and records relating to recovery site suitability, as described in section XII.B.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProcedures and Records, to the processor. The recovery establishment should maintain copies of all transferred records and organize them in its records management system.\n\nMethods of Retention\n\nYou may maintain records electronically, as original paper records, or as true copies such as photocopies, microfiche, or microfilm. Equipment that is necessary to make the records available and legible, such as computer and reader equipment, should be readily available. You should back up records stored in electronic systems.\n\nExample: You are a processor that receives paper records of the donor's medical history from the recovery establishment. You review the medical history as part of the donor eligibility determination. Later, you scan the paper records and save them as a.pdf file on a computer that is backed up. The electronic records are true copies of the paper records. Therefore, you may destroy the paper records. However, if instead of scanning, you were to re-type (transfer) the information into the computer, you would be creating a new record, not making a true copy. Errors may have been introduced while re-typing the information into the new record. In this scenario, you should keep the original paper (hardcopy) records as proof of concurrent recordkeeping.\n\nLength of Retention\n\nTo ensure the identity, purity, potency, and safety of ACTPs, we recommend that records be kept for 10 years after their creation, unless stated otherwise in this document.20 You should retain the records pertaining to a specific ACTP at least 10 years after the date of its administration, or if the date of administration is not known, then at least 10 years after the date of the ACTP's distribution, disposition, or expiration, whichever is the latest date.\n\nFootnote 20: The regulations in 21 CFR 211.180 require that records be kept for at least 1 year after expiration. However, we recognize that expiration of ACTPs varies from hours to an indefinite period of time for some cryopreserved ACTPs. Additionally, some forms of contamination or safety concerns may not be evident until years after the product is manufactured. For these reasons, we recommend a record retention period of at least 10 years.\n\nLaboratories that perform relevant disease agent testing of donor specimens and/or microbiological testing of ACTPs that do not know the date of administration, distribution, disposition, or expiration, should keep donor testing information for 10 years after the creation of the record.\n\nContracts and Agreements\n\nYou should maintain the name and address and a list of the responsibilities of any establishment that performs a manufacturing step for you. You should have this information available during inspections conducted by the FDA. We recommend that contracts, agreements, or other arrangements describe the responsibilities of all parties.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExample 1: A contract, agreement, or other arrangement with an individual or establishment who obtains the donor's medical records should describe the information that you want that individual or establishment to obtain.\n\nExample 2: When donor eligibility is determined following a review of records obtained by another establishment, the contract, agreement, or other arrangement might specifically identify what records will be obtained, in what format they will be provided, responsibilities for record retention and access, and if the reviewing firm will convey donor eligibility conclusions back to the establishment that collected the information.\n\n17 Tracking\n\nGeneral\n\nEach ACTP should be tracked throughout manufacturing, from recovery to final disposition, to ensure that the ACTP is free from contamination and to ensure the quality of the ACTP. If you perform any step in the manufacture of an ACTP during which you handle the ACTP, you should track the ACTP. You should perform tracking to facilitate the investigation of an actual or suspected incidence of contamination, or impact on product quality, and take appropriate and timely corrective action. If you do not handle the ACTP (e.g., the testing laboratory that receives a specimen but does not actually handle the ACTP), you would not participate in tracking the ACTP.\n\nSystem of ACTP Tracking\n\nYou should establish and maintain a tracking system that enables the ACTP to be tracked from:\n\nThe donor to the consignee or final disposition; and\n\nThe consignee or final disposition to the donor.\n\nAlternatively, if you perform some, but not all, of the steps in the manufacture of an ACTP during which you handle the ACTP, you may participate in a system of ACTP tracking established and maintained by another establishment responsible for other steps in the manufacture of the same ACTP. You should verify that the tracking system is effective, especially if you participate in a tracking system maintained by another establishment.\n\nDistinct Identification Code\n\nYou should ensure that each ACTP that you manufacture is assigned and labeled with a distinct identification code that relates the ACTP to the donor and to all records pertaining to the ACTP. You should also ensure that labeling includes information needed to facilitate effective tracking from the donor to the recipient and from the recipient to the donor. The distinct identification code should be created specifically for tracking purposes.\n\n4.4.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nYou may adopt the distinct identification code assigned by another establishment engaged in manufacturing or assign a new code. You should verify and/or validate that your tracking system is effective. The distinct identification code should be able to track to the donor but does not necessarily have to be on all records concerning the donor or on the package insert. However, the distinct identification code should be affixed to the ACTP container.\n\nTracking from Conginese to Donor\n\nAs part of your tracking system, you should establish and maintain a method for recording the distinct identification code and type of each ACTP distributed to a consignee to enable tracking from the consignee to the donor.\n\nTracking from Donor to Consignee or Final Disposition\n\nAs part of your tracking system, you should establish and maintain a method for documenting the disposition of each of your ACTPs, to enable tracking from the donor to the consignee or final disposition. This information should permit the prompt identification of the consignee of the ACTP, if any.\n\nConsignees\n\nAs part of the tracking system, you should inform the consignee that the consignee should enter the distinct identification code for the ACTP in the recipient animal's veterinary medical record. This will help to identify affected recipients in the event you become aware of ACTP contamination or a product defect (e.g., contamination with a disease agent or improper storage conditions). Also, you should request that the consignee notify you of the distinct identification code for the ACTP if an ACTP is associated with any adverse drug experiences or product defects.\n\nExample: You distribute an ACTP to a veterinary hospital. As part of your tracking system, the ACTP label contains a distinct identification code that relates the ACTP to the donor, the donation event, and the records pertaining to that ACTP. The ACTP label also includes a sticker with the distinct identification code and directions for the veterinarian to maintain the sticker in the recipient animal's veterinary medical record. After distribution of the ACTP you become aware that the donor of the ACTP was infected with a relevant disease agent at the time of donation. Using your tracking system, you contact the veterinary hospital and inform them of the potential risk of infection. You also provide them with the distinct identification code related to the ACTP derived from the infected donor. Using the sticker placed in the veterinary medical records, the veterinary hospital can identify and treat affected recipients and report any adverse drug experiences back to you.\n\nGeneral\n\nRecording and evaluating complaints is important for monitoring the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the ACTP.\n\nProcedures\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #253 Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Animal Cells, Tissues, and Cell- and Tissue-Based Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.6537821292877197", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: Under what circumstances may QAU audit reports be inspected by FDA? Is there any requirement to maintain these reports or can they be discarded?\n\nQU audit reports as a matter of administrative policy are exempt from routine FDA inspection. FDA's access to QAU audit reports would be through the Courts should the subject matter of those reports be litigated. Since there is no FDA requirement that these reports be maintained, the disposition of these reports is up to the firm's management. FDA advises that such records not be destroyed without the firm seeking advice from its legal counsel.\n4. What are the quality assurance unit inspection requirements for acute and short-term studies?\n\nFor studies lasting less than 4 weeks, each final report should be reviewed by the quality assurance unit for accuracy. With regard to the in process phases (dose preparation, dose administration, in vivo observation and measurement, necropsy, etc.), a random sampling approach could be used so that over a series of studies each critical phase has been monitored. The random sampling approach should be statistically designed so that it is adequate for revealing GLP deviations. The approach and its justification should be made a part of the standard operating procedures of the quality assurance unit.\n5. What constitutes proper quality assurance unit inspection of each phase of a nonclinical laboratory study?A variety of procedures are acceptable for performing a quality assurance unit inspection. The GLPs do not mandate specific procedures. The development of an acceptable procedure should not necessarily be limited to but should consider the following:\n\n(a) nonclinical laboratory studies lasting longer than 6 months should be inspected every 3 months; whereas, studies lasting less than 6 months should be inspected at suitable intervals,\n\n(b) each phase of the study should be inspected,\n\n(c) inspection reports are to be submitted to management and to the study director, and\n\n(d) the purpose of the inspections is to identify significant problems, which may affect study integrity, and to determine that no changes from approved protocols or standard operating procedures were made without proper authorization.\n\nThe phases of a particular study will be determined by the nature of the study. For example, the phases of a typical feeding study include the following:\n\nprotocol development and approval\n\ntest article characterization\n\ntest article stability determination\n\ntest article-carrier mixture preparation\n\ntest article-carrier mixture sampling\n\ntest article-carrier mixture homogeneity determination\n\ntest system quarantine\n\ntest system allocation to housing\n\ntest article carrier mixture distribution to test system\n\nperiodic measurements\n\nanimal observations\n\nfood consumption\n\nbody weights\n\nblood sampling -- hematology and clinical chemistry\n\nnecropsy -- histopathology\n\nstatistical analyses and report preparation\n\nThe type of inspection will depend on the nature of the phase. Each phase must be inspected at least once during the study; the times selected for inspection should be those most likely to reveal problems before the quality of the data generated could be adversely affected.\n\nCould you take a typical subacute 14-day study and define the phases?Phases in a short term study (depending on the type) would include protocol preparation, dose preparation, animal allocation, test system dosage, animal observation, necropsy, data recording, data analysis and final report writing.\n\nBy what authority may the Agency examine master schedule sheets for studies, which may never be used in support of an application for a research or marketing permit?\n\nStudies that are not intended to be used to support an application for a research or marketing permit are not covered by the GLPs and need not appear on the master schedule sheet. If however, the studies are intended to be submitted, then they should be listed and can be inspected by the Agency under its authority to evaluate the results of studies designed to demonstrate product safety.\n\nAre acute studies to be included on the master schedule sheet?\n\nYes, if they fall within the scope of the GLPs.\n\nIn regard to the master schedule sheet, can the \"current status of each study\" be satisfied by listing the starting date and completion date of the study? Can the \"status of the final report\" be satisfied by listing the estimated or actual date of issuance of the final report?\n\nAlthough the GLPs do not specify entries for \"current status of each study,\" dates alone would not be adequate. Suggested entries that are possible include \"study proceeding according to protocol,\" \"study proceeding according to protocol as amended on such-and-such date,\" \"study terminated due to such-and-such,\" etc. Likewise, entries for the status of the final report might include \"awaiting final hematology report,\" \"data in statistical analysis,\" \"first draft prepared,\" \"draft under circulation for review and comment,\" etc.\n\nIn our laboratory, critical operations for all studies are carried out by the same individuals using essentially similar procedures. Would it be adequate for the quality assurance unit to inspect a set of representative operations for GLP and standard operating procedure compliance that would incorporate a good cross-section of studies?\n\nNo, but refer to the answer under question 4 above.\n\nIn reference to the quality assurance unit review of the final report, you have indicated that not all numbers have to be traced. Do you have in mind a standard, which describes an acceptable level of accuracy, e.g., 90%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%?The quality assurance unit review is to ensure that the final report accurately reflects the raw data. Inasmuch as final reports of certain long-term studies can encompass several hundred thousand observations, it would be a prodigious exercise for the quality assurance unit to verify and trace all raw data. Further, the Agency did not mean to require that the quality assurance unit review would include a check of the accuracy of the calculations used to arrive at the final report. This activity would be redundant since the contributing scientists would have already done so in preparing their reports. Rather, the review was expected to be of sufficient depth to reveal inaccuracies in the final report. Consequently, the Agency envisioned the development of a statistically based system, whereby; a random sample of the results in the final report is traced. The procedure should be made a part of the standard operating procedures. The Agency has not established an acceptable level of accuracy of the trace.\n\nIs the master schedule sheet intended to be prospective or historical? If it is historical, what is the required retention period?\n\nThe master schedule sheet is intended to include a listing of all nonclinical laboratory studies currently in progress as well as those which have been conducted during the terms specified in section 58.195 of the GLPs.\n* Does the master schedule sheet have to list studies on compounds for which no data has yet been submitted to the Agency?\n\nYes. The GLPs cover all nonclinical laboratory studies of Agency regulated products that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits.\n* The GLPs state that the quality assurance unit should assure that the final report reflects the study results. Is it required that every final report be reviewed by the quality assurance unit?\n\nYes. This procedure helps to ensure the accuracy of the final report.\n* Does the quality assurance unit review of each final study report have to be reported to management?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.712054967880249", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: Required records must be retained at the plant or facility for at least 2 years after the date they were prepared (21 CFR 507.208(a)). This includes the required training records (documenting the training in principles of animal food hygiene and animal food safety). For example, if a facility offers initial and periodic training in the principles of animal food hygiene and animal food safety, it would retain at least the most recent two years of training records for each individual required to have the training. Even if a facility does not provide periodic training, it must maintain the individual's initial training records for at least two years. The records can be stored offsite if they can be retrieved and provided onsite within 24 hours of request for official review. Electronic records are considered to be onsite if they are accessible from an onsite location (21 CFR 507.208(c)).\n\nIf you already keep the required training records to comply with other regulations, or for any other reason, you can use those records to meet these recordkeeping requirements as long as they contain all of the required information and satisfy the other relevant requirements of 21 CFR part 507, subpart F. If they do not contain all of the required information, you can supplement them with additional records as necessary to include all of the required information and satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR part 507, subpart F (21 CFR 507.212(a)). The required training records do not need to be kept in one set of records. If existing records contain some of the required information, any additional information required may be either kept separately or combined with the existing records (21 CFR 507.212(b)). If you use multiple records to meet the requirements of 21 CFR part 507, subpart F, the records should reflect how they are associated with each other.\n\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice for Animal Food (21 CFR Part 507, Subpart B)\n\nPersonnel (21 CFR 507.14)\n\nManagement of the establishment must take reasonable measures and precautions to ensure that all persons working in direct contact with animal food, animal food-contact surfaces, and animal food-packaging materials conform to hygienic practices as necessary to protect against the contamination of animal food (21 CFR 507.14(a)). Persons working in direct contact with animal food may include employees, contractors, and visitors. Methods for conforming to hygienic practices and maintaining cleanliness include: maintaining adequate personal cleanliness; washing hands thoroughly in an adequate hand-washing facility as necessary and appropriate to protect against contamination; removing or securing jewelry and other objects that could fall into animal food, equipment, or containers; storing clothing and personal belongings inareas other than where animal food is exposed or where equipment or utensils are cleaned; and taking any other precautions necessary to protect against contamination of animal food, animal food contact surfaces, or animal food-packaging materials (21 CFR 507.14(b)).\n\nTo the extent necessary to protect against the contamination of animal food, management of the establishment must ensure that personnel maintain adequate personal cleanliness (21 CFR 507.14(b)(1)). Management of the establishment should set expectations for personal cleanliness based on the plant, the individual's role at the plant, and the type of animal food. For example, management expectations for personnel working in a livestock animal food plant might allow clothes that are dusty when working in the plant, but might not allow clothes covered with oil, grease, excessive dirt, or other foreign materials that may contaminate the animal food. In contrast, a pet food plant concerned about microorganism contamination might require that personnel use protective clothing and dedicated plant footwear while working in the plant.\n\nManagement of the establishment must ensure that personnel wash hands thoroughly using an adequate hand-washing facility as necessary and appropriate to protect against contamination (21 CFR 507.14(b)(2)). Expectations for employee hand washing might also vary depending on the type of plant, the animal food being produced, and an employee's duties at the plant. Personnel should wash their hands as necessary and appropriate to protect against contamination of animal food from foreign materials (such as grease or dirt). In certain facilities where contamination by undesirable microorganisms is a concern for the type of animal food, hand-washing should occur when individuals enter the food production area. Hand-washing should also occur after the individual handles or touches anything other than food or food contact surfaces, such as the floor, door handles, or hoses, and before they handle any finished animal food that has been processed to reduce or destroy microorganisms. Additional information about adequate hand-washing facilities is discussed in this guidance, see section VI.D.5. Hand-washing facilities (21 CFR 507.20(e)).\n\nTo the extent necessary to protect against the contamination of animal food, management of the establishment must ensure that personnel remove or secure jewelry and other objects that might fall into animal food, equipment, or containers (21 CFR 507.14(b)(3)). Examples of objects that could fall into the animal food, equipment, or containers include: pens, sunglasses, gloves, tools, keys, pocket knives, or cell phones. Personnel should consider whether items stored in outside pockets (such as shirt pockets) might be able to fall out during operations, and if so, remove these items or place them in a more secure pocket.\n\nTo the extent necessary to protect against the contamination of animal food, management of the establishment must also ensure that personnel store clothing and other personal belongings in areas other than where animal food is exposed or where equipment or utensils are cleaned (21 CFR 507.14(b)(4)). Management should designate an area to store these items where they cannot fall into or be accidentally incorporated into the animal food, equipment or utensils. Some facilities have separate areas to store these items, such as break rooms or lockers. Other facilities may not have a separate area, but may instruct personnel to store items within the plant in a specific location that is away from exposed animal food and equipment or utensil cleaning activities. For example, a facility may instruct personnel to store jackets adjacent to a cold storage area on wall hooks that are located away from exposed animal food.\n\nIn addition to these specific hygienic practices, to the extent necessary to protect against the contamination of animal food, management of the establishment must take any additional precautions that are necessary to protect against the contamination of animal food, animal food-contact surfaces, or animal food-packaging materials (21 CFR 507.14(b)(5)). For example, in some plants it may be appropriate for employees to wear hair and beard nets to protect against the contamination of animal food.\n\nAppendix B Plant and grounds (21 CFR 507.17)\n\nMaintaining the grounds around an animal food plant (21 CFR 507.17(a))\n\nGrounds around a plant under control of the management of the establishment must be kept in a way that will protect against the contamination of the animal food (21 CFR 507.17(a)). The grounds are considered to be under the control of management when the property/land is owned or leased by the facility or used with permission. The grounds are close enough to be \"around\" the plant when they could impact plant operations. Public right of ways or neighboring properties under different ownership would not be considered under the control of the management.\n\nThe grounds must be maintained by properly storing equipment, removing litter and waste, and cutting weeds or grass within the immediate vicinity of the plant that may attract, harbor, or serve as a breeding place for pests (21 CFR 507.17(a)(1)). Facilities should perform these ground maintenance activities at a regular frequency so that the grounds conditions are not an attraction or harborage for pests.\n\nDriveways, yards and parking areas must be maintained so they are not a source of contamination for exposed animal food (21 CFR 507.17(a)(2)). For example, these areas should be well-drained and free of debris to reduce the introduction of foreign material into the animal food. While a few puddles from a recent rain may not be a source of contamination for animal food, low-lying areas that pool water for significant periods of time may cause contamination, especially if they are located near areas where exposed animal food is stored outdoors.\n\nThe plant grounds must have adequate drainage of areas that may contribute to contamination of animal food (21 CFR 507.17(a)(3)). Drainage should remove water away from the plant, or animal food storage areas. Driveways and entrances should be drained to minimize standing water, mud, dirt or waterborne debris that may contribute to contamination of animal food. Adequate drainage also reduces the potential for standing water, which may attract pests.\n\nWaste must be treated and disposed of in a way that it will not be a source of contamination where animal food is exposed (21 CFR 507.17(a)(4)). Waste could include sewage, other liquid waste, or processing waste. Portable restrooms should be placed away from animal food so if a leak occurs it does not contaminate animal food. Processing waste should be held in appropriate receptacles and removed from the site regularly. If toxic materials are used to treat waste, they must be stored away from animal food in compliance with 21 CFR 507.19(d) as explained in this guidance, see section VI.C.2. Use of toxic materials in animal food facilities (21 CFR 507.19(d)).\n\n2 Plant size, construction, and design (21 CFR 507.17(b))\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #235 Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.9491281509399414", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: SUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that \"personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform\" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an \"acting\" or \"deputy\" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated \"deputy\" or \"acting\" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n\nThe QAU is not expected to perform a scientific evaluation of a study nor to \"second-guess\" the scientific procedures that are used. QAU inspections are made to ensure that the GLPs, SOPs and protocols are being followed and that the data summarized in the final report accurately reflect the results of the study. A variety of procedures can be used to do this but certainly the procedures should include an examination and correlation of the raw data records.\n\nMust the QAU keep copies of all protocols and amendments and SOPs and amendments?\n\nThe QAU must keep copies of all protocols as currently amended. The only SOPs that the QAU are required to keep are those concerned with the operations and procedures of the QAU.\n\nDoes the QAU have to monitor compliance with regulations promulgated by other government agencies?\n\nThe GLPs do not require this.\n\nCan an individual who is involved in a nonclinical laboratory study perform QAU functions for portions of the study that the individual is not involved with?\n\nNo. However, the individual can perform QAU functions for a study that he/she is not involved with.\n\nDoes the QAU review amendments to the final report? Yes.\n\nWhat studies are required to be listed on the master schedule sheet?\n\nThe master schedule sheet should list all nonclinical laboratory studies conducted on FDA regulated products and intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit.\n\nMay the QAU in its periodic reports to management and the study director recommend actions to solve existing problems? Yes.\n\nIf raw data are transcribed and sent to the sponsor for (a) preparing the data in computer format or (b) performing a statistical analysis, what are the responsibilities of the QAU?\n\nFor (a) the QAU should assure that the computer formatted data accurately reflect the raw data. For (b) the statistical analyses would comprise a report from a participating scientist, therefore it should be checked by QAU and appended to the final report.\n9. Can the QAU also be responsible for maintaining the laboratory archives?\n\nYes.\n10. Can a QAU be constituted as'a single person?\n\nYes, provided that the workload is not excessive and other duties do not prevent the person from doing an adequate job. It would be prudent to designate an alternate in case of disability/vacations/ etc.\n11. Who is responsible for defining study phases and designating critical study phases and can these be covered in the SOP?\n\nThe GLPs do not isolate this responsibility. Logically, the task should be done by the study director and the participating scientists working in concert with the QAU and laboratory management. It can be covered by an SOP.\n\nSUBPART C FACILITIES\n\nSection 58.41 General.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.43 Animal Care Facilities.\n\nDo the GLPs require clean/dirty separation for the animal care areas?\n\nNo. They do require adequate separation of species and studies.\n\nDo the GLPs require that separate animal rooms be used to house test systems and conduct different studies? No. The GLPs require separate areas adequate to assure proper separation of test systems, isolation of individual projects, animal quarantine and routine or specialized housing of animals, as necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n\nDo the GLPs require that access to animal rooms be limited only to authorized individuals? No. However, undue stresses and potentially adverse influences on the test system should be minimized. Section 58.45 Animal Supply Facilities. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.47 Facilities for Handling Test and Control Articles.\n\nDo test and control articles have to be maintained in locked storage units? No, but accurate records of test and control article accountability must be maintained. Section 58.49 Laboratory operation areas. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.51 Specim and data storage facilities. 1. What do the GLPs require with regard to facilities for the archives? Space should be provided for archives limited to access by authorized personnel. Storage conditions should minimize deterioration of documents and specimens. Section 58.53 Administrative and personnel facilities. No questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSUBPART D\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nSection 58.61 Equipment design.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.63 Maintenance and calibration of equipment.\n\nHas FDA established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of equipment (balances) used in nonclinical laboratory studies?\n\nThe agency has not established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of balances used in nonclinical laboratory studies. This would be a large undertaking in part due to the wide variety of equipment that is available and to the differing workloads that would be imposed on the equipment. It is suggested that you work with the equipment manufacturers and your study directors to arrive at a suitable calibration schedule. The key point is that the calibration should be frequent enough to assure data validity. The maintenance and calibration schedules should be part of the SOPs for each instrument.\n\nWhen an equipment manufacturer performs the routine equipment maintenance, do the equipment manufacturer's maintenance procedures have to be described in the facilities' SOPs?\n\nNo. The facilities' SOPs would have to state that maintenance was being performed by the equipment manufacturer according to their own procedures.\n\nSUBPART E\n\nTESTING FACILITIES OPERATION\n\nSection 58.81 Standard Operating Procedures.\n\nWhat amount of detail should be included in the standard operating procedures (SOPs)?\n\nThe GLPs do not specify the amount of detail to be included in the SOPs. The SOPs are intended to minimize the introduction of systematic error into a study by ensuring that all personnel will be familiar with and use the same procedures. The adequacy of the SOPs is a key responsibility of management. A guideline of adequacy that could be used is to determine whether the SOPs are understood and can be followed by trained laboratory personnel.\n\nCan the study director authorize changes in the SOPs? No. Approval of the SOPs and changes thereto is a function of laboratory management.\n\nHow many copies of the complete laboratory SOPs are needed? Each work station should have access to the SOPs applicable to the work performed at the station. A complete set of the SOPs, including authorized amendments, should be maintained in the archives.\n\nWho approves the SOPs of the Quality Assurance Unit? Laboratory Management.\n\nTo what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs? The GLPs do not specify the contents of individual SOPs, but the SOP that deals with computerized data acquisition should include the purpose of the program, the specifications, the procedures, the end products, the language, the interactions with other programs, procedures for assuring authorized data entry and access, procedures for making and authorizing changes to the program, the source listing of the program and perhaps even a flow chart. The laboratory's computer specialists should determine what other characteristics need to be described in the SOP.\n\nSection 58.83 Reagents and solutions.\n1. What are the GLP requirements for labeling of reagents purchased directly from manufacturers? All reagents used in a nonclinical laboratory have to be labeled to indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date. Purchased reagents usually carry all these items except for the expiration date, so the laboratory should label the reagent containers with an expiration date. The expiration date selected should be in line with laboratory experience and need not require specific stability testing.\n2. How extensive should the procedures be for confirming the quality of incoming reagents used in nonclinical laboratory studies? Laboratory management should make this decision but the SOPs should document the actual procedures used.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5173590183258057", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: 2718 C.2.4 The sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of where essential records are located, including source records.

Therefore, FDA issues an approval with conditions letter to the sponsor. The letter states that the sponsor may initiate enrollment in the study, using an informed consent document that is modified to includethe potential risk discussed above on the condition that, within 45 days from the date of FDA's letter, the sponsor submits the modified consent form to FDA for review.\n\nIn addition, FDA's letter notes that FDA believes changes to the study design are needed to enable the feasibility study to support a future pivotal study. An attachment to FDA's letter includes a study design consideration suggesting that the sponsor modify the follow-up assessments to include the evaluation noted above. The attachment also includes a future consideration related to the likely need for a longer-term animal study prior to initiating a future pivotal study to collect additional safety data, unless the sponsor is able to provide additional data or a scientifically valid rationale for why such a study is not needed.\n\nThe sponsor submits an amendment to the IDE to respond to FDA's approval with conditions letter within 45 days. In addition to addressing the informed consent issue, the submission provides a modified clinical protocol addressing the study design consideration noted in FDA's letter. FDA approves the IDE without conditions. FDA's approval letter notes that FDA believes the study design is adequate to support the study goals.\n\nExample 2\n\nA sponsor submits an original IDE application to request approval of a 300-subject pivotal study at 10 sites to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a permanently implanted device to treat a serious chronic medical condition.\n\nFDA identifies the following issues that must be addressed before initiating subject enrollment in a study:\n\nInadequate non-clinical durability testing to evaluate a potential failure mode.\n\nEnrollment criteria do not exclude subjects with severe renal insufficiency in a study that requires contrast-enhanced imaging and for whom the device is contraindicated. This subgroup has an unacceptably high risk of serious adverse events and should not be enrolled in the study.\n\nFDA also identifies the following study design issues it believes should be addressed to enable the study to support a marketing application:\n\nThe sponsor proposed an historical control but FDA believes a concurrent randomized control group is needed because available historical control data are not representative of the current standard of care.\n\nThe sponsor proposed a 3-month follow-up duration, but FDA believes the primary endpoints should be evaluated at 6 months due to essential longer-term safety and effectiveness questions regarding this device.\n\nThere are inadequacies regarding definitions of parameters associated with the safety endpoint.\n\nThe protocol needs to include additional details regarding the statistical analysis plan.\n\nBased on the first two concerns, FDA disapproves the study. An attachment to FDA's letter conveys the four above-stated study design considerations, which the sponsor need not address.\n\n1.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn response to FDA's letter, the sponsor submits an amendment to the IDE that includes additional durability test data and a modified clinical protocol. Modifications to the protocol include changes to the enrollment criteria to exclude the specific sub-population of concern. The amendment specifically responds to each deficiency. Additional changes were made to address FDA's study design considerations. Specifically, the sponsor has proposed a longer follow-up duration but continues to believe that a historical control is appropriate.\n\nFDA's review of the amendment does not identify any issues precluding the sponsor from initiating the study. FDA determines that the durability test data provided strongly suggest good long-term device performance and are sufficient to support study of the device in a small group of subjects. However, the data are not adequate to fully FDA's concern and longer term non-clinical durability testing should be conducted before the full subject cohort is exposed to the risks of the study. Furthermore, while the revised study design partially addresses FDA's concerns, based on the information provided, FDA continues to believe that a concurrent randomized control group is needed to enable the study to support a future marketing application.\n\nFDA issues a staged approval letter allowing the sponsor to begin study enrollment of up to 50 subjects at five sites. FDA's letter informs the sponsor that, concurrent with enrollment in the study, the sponsor should conduct longer-term durability testing. The results of this testing will be needed to support expansion of the study. FDA's letter also indicates that FDA believes the current study design is unlikely to support a marketing application. The study design consideration included in an attachment to FDA's letter explains why FDA believes that a historical control will not suffice and a concurrent control group is likely needed.\n\nThe sponsor submits a Pre-Submission to discuss a new proposal for a concurrent control. FDA and the sponsor work together to develop minor modifications to the sponsor's proposal to address FDA's concerns.\n\nThe sponsor submits a supplement26 to the IDE to modify the study design as discussed in the Pre-Submission. FDA approves the IDE supplement. FDA's approval letter informs the sponsor that FDA believes the study design provided in the submission is adequate and may support a future marketing application, assuming that the study is successfully executed and meets its stated endpoints without raising unforeseen safety concerns. The enrollment continues to be limited to 50 subjects while the durability testing is ongoing.\n\nFootnote 26: Because none of the changes proposed in the example submission is in response to deficiencies, it is designated as a supplement and not an amendment.\n\nTwo months later, with 37 subjects enrolled in the study, the sponsor submits an IDE supplement providing durability testing results and requests approval to enroll up to 300 subjects. FDA finds the results acceptable and grants the sponsor approval to enroll the full subject cohort.\n\nExample 3 (variation on Example 2)\n\nA sponsor submits an original IDE application to request approval of a 300-subject pivotal study at 10 sites to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a permanently implanted device to treat aserious chronic medical condition. FDA identifies the same concerns described in Example 2. In contrast to Example 2, the sponsor chooses not to address the study design considerations provided in the attachment to FDA's letters. FDA's approval letters (for the initial stage and the subsequent full enrollment) inform the sponsor that FDA believes the current study design is unlikely to support a marketing application. The study design considerations provided explain the modifications that FDA believes are needed to enable the study to support a marketing application. The sponsor, however, chooses to conduct the study as currently designed.\n\n11 Conclusions\n\nFDA recognizes the public health benefit of permitting clinical investigations of medical devices to proceed in a timely and efficient manner while ensuring proper subject protections. When determining whether to approve an IDE application, FDA considers many factors, as discussed in this document. Where appropriate, FDA seeks to offer flexibility in how to address outstanding issues (e.g., approval with conditions, staged approval, and future considerations) to allow clinical investigations to commence without unnecessary delay while ensuring that human subjects are adequately protected.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.22665548324585", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n\nA general comparison appears in the FDA's Good Clinical Practice program website, Comparison of FDA and HHS Human Subject Protection Regulations found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/EducaionalMaterials/ucm112910.htm. For additional information on 45 CFR Part 46\n\nsubpart A refer to the Office for Human Research Protections at\n\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm.\nYes, in many cases an investigational IVD study is eligible for IRB expedited review (see 21 CFR 56.110), for both initial approval and continuing review. The categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure are described in the Federal Register notice on expedited review, found at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm118099.htm. As stated in a Federal Register notice, however, sponsors and investigators may not use the expedited review procedure where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998).\n\n6. Can leftover specimens be used in IVD studies without informed consent?\n\nThe document entitled, \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm078384.htm, describes the limited circumstances in which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding requirements for informed consent. (See Glossary for definition of \"leftover specimens\".)\n\n7. Can those who routinely conduct studies with IVDs (e.g., research hospitals) use a general informed consent to address future studies using samples collected in their own facility?\n\nTo fulfill FDA informed consent requirements for studies of IVDs, a site may develop an informed consent process to address the use of samples collected at the facility (see the Glossary for definition) in a specific study or for a broader category of future studies. This general informed consent process may be used for subjects seen at and/or admitted to a specific facility. The informed consent document must contain all of the required elements found in 21 CFR 50.25.\n\n8. Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process?\n\nIf the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm078384.htm.\n\nVI. Data Considerations\n\n1. What information should the protocol include to ensure that the investigational IVD study will be scientifically sound?\n\nWe recommend that the protocol include a clear description of study design; objectives, estimation of performance goals (e.g., desired confidence interval widths) that are directly related to the intended claims for the IVD device, or hypotheses; and a statistical plan to be applied to the data. (See the Glossary for definitions of protocol, statistical hypothesis, and confidence interval.)\n\n2. Is it acceptable to develop new or to revise existing study hypotheses as the study progresses?\n\nWe generally believe it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions from after-the-fact hypotheses. We recommend that changes in study protocols be carefully documented and explained. FDA encourages sponsors to contact the appropriate review division to discuss studies before they are initiated and to consult FDA before changes in protocols are made mid-study. (For the FDA divisions responsible for review of IVD products, see Introduction, Section II, of this guidance.)\n\n3. How should I determine appropriate sample size for a study?\n\nThe sponsor should formulate sample size based on standard statistical techniques and the sample size should account for any unique issues related to intended use(s), device technologies, and/or the biology of the condition being studied.\n\nWhat guidance is available for sponsors to determine how to estimate IVD performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, how to handle discrepant results, and what to do when a study is performed without a truth standard (\"gold standard\") (see the Glossary for definitions)?\n\nFDA has recognized a number of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [(CLSI), formerly National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)] standards related to these issues. A list of these standards, but not the standards themselves, can be found through the database on the CDRH web page http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scrlpts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards\n\nThe agency's guidance entitled \"Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests\" can be viewed at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm071148.htm\n\nHow much leeway is there in deciding on the populations from which human specimens are collected and under what conditions are data on simulated specimens (see the Glossary for definition) acceptable?\n\nStudies should be performed in a representative sample of the intended use population (i.e., representation of both diseased and non-diseased cases, and controlling for subject demographics and morbidity factors that may affect the level of device performance). When a disease is rare or samples are needed specifically to challenge cut-off points, sponsors may use enriched samples, panels of credentialed samples (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panels), and/or spiked or contrived samples. The acceptance of simulated specimens depends on how well they represent specimens from the intended-use population and whether their performance accurately reflects what the IVD device user can expect.\n\nIs it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including \"outliers\". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.9509711265563965", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA needs to hear about all important effects of the investigational product, so that the agency can (1) ensure that the results of the investigation are not biased, and (2) make a determination as to the product's safety and effectiveness.\n\nCan information about a subject's death be collected even if the subject has discontinued participation in the study?\n\nYes. Although a subject may have discontinued participation in a study, data about a subject's death is contained in public vital statistics records. Access to public records is not subject to restriction under 21 CFR 50.24 or other FDA regulations.\n\n114. Do FDA's regulations require that informed consent be obtained from a deceased subject's family members before public records can be accessed?\n\nNo. Access to public records is not subject to restriction under 21 CFR 50.24 or other FDA regulations. The information included in death records may be accessed and collected without triggering FDA's informed consent requirements.\n\nUnder FDA's regulations, \"human subject\" means \"an individual who is or becomes a participant in research, either as a recipient of the test article or as a control. A subject may be either a healthy human or a patient.\" (See 21 CFR 50.3(g); similar language is found at 21 CFR 312.3 and 812.3(p).) FDA has interpreted its regulations as applicable only to research involving living human subjects. Since the individuals referenced are deceased, such review does not meet FDA's definition of research involving human subjects. FDA has also concluded that a limited look at public death records would, in any event, be encompassed by the exception from informed consent for emergency research.52\n\nFootnote 52: See Preamble to the October 2, 1996 Final Rule, Comment #94, 61 Fed. Reg. 51519.\n\nPublic access to autopsy records would be determined by applicable State or local laws and regulations.\n\n115. For emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, involving an exception from informed consent, may an IRB or Privacy Board waive the authorization requirement that would otherwise apply under 45 CFR 164.508 of the HIPAA Privacy Rule?\n\nYes. Under the Privacy Rule issued to implement the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), an individual must generally sign a permission, known as an Authorization, before a covered entity may use or disclose the individual's protected health information (PHI) for research purposes, unless the covered entity receives documentation that an IRB or Privacy Board has waived or altered the Authorization requirement. 45 CFR 164.512(i). In the context of emergency research involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24, there may well be considerations present, such as the inability of the subjects to provide Authorization as a result of their medical condition, that could support an IRB or Privacy Board decision to waive the HIPAA Privacy Rule's Authorization requirement.\n\nThe Privacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.512(i) contains criteria for waiver or alteration of the Authorization requirement by an IRB or Privacy Board. In particular, the documentation of waiver approval obtained by the covered entity must, among other things, include a statement that the IRB or Privacy Board has determined that the alteration or waiver, in whole or in part, of Authorization satisfies the following criteria:\n\nThe PHI use or disclosure involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals based on at least the presence of (1) an adequate plan to protect PHI identifiers from improper use and disclosure; (2) an adequate plan to destroy those identifiers at the earliest opportunity, consistent with the research, absent a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or if retention is otherwise required by law; and (3) adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity except (a) as required by law, (b) for authorized oversight of the research study, or (c) for other research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI is permitted by the Privacy Rule.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without the requested waiver or alteration.\n\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.\n\nThus, to the extent an IRB or Privacy Board has determined that the circumstances of the emergency research subject to an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24 satisfy the HIPAA Privacy Rule's waiver criteria, and has documented the waiver approval in accordance with 45 CFR 164.512(i)(2), a covered entity may use or disclose PHI for the research based on such documentation.\n\nXI Data Monitoring Committee (Dmc)\n\nBefore a study may be initiated, the IRB must find and document that an independent DMC has been established to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iv)).\n\nFDA interprets this regulatory provision to permit a sponsor to either establish an independent DMC or to secure the services of an already established DMC to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation. FDA is making this clarification to provide flexibility to sponsors in meeting the regulatory requirements.\n\nFor more information on the roles, responsibilities and operating procedures of Data Monitoring Committees, please see FDA's Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors, Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees, March 2006.53 The DMC guidance represents FDA's current thinking on DMCs and their operations.\n\nFootnote 53: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126578.pdf\n\nXII For Further Information\n\nA Contacts\n\nSponsors, clinical investigators, and IRBs with questions regarding policy or applications pertaining to an exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24 may contact the appropriate office(s) identified on FDA's website:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\nB FDA's Websites\n\nGood Clinical Practice:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/default.htm\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/default.htm\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/default.htm\n\n21 CFR 50.24\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nThe text of 21 CFR 50.24 appears below:\n\nSubpart B-Informed Consent of Human Subjects Sec. 50.24, Exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research.\n\n(a) The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the clinical investigation described in this section may approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of all research subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a licensed physician who is a member of or consultant to the IRB and who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation) finds and documents each of the following:\n\n(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.\n\n(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because:\n\n(i) The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;\n\n(ii) The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized representatives is feasible; and\n\n(iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.\n\n(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because:\n\n(i) Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;\n\n(ii) Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and\n\n(iii) Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.\n\n(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact legally authorized representatives and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\n(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document consistent with 50.25. These procedures and the informed consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.901207447052002", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: FDA also recognizes that subjects participating in a clinical trial may be interested in the financial interests/arrangements of the clinical investigator at the site where the subject is considering participation. The Department of Health and Human Services Guidance Document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d which is applicable to FDA regulated research, recommends that consideration be given to providing potential subjects with information about the financial interests and arrangements of the parties involved in the research. This guidance is available at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/guid.pdf.\n\nAppendix I Recorokkeeping\n\nQ: What are the recordkeeping requirements for financial disclosure information?\n\nThe recordkeeping requirements for applicants are described in 21 CFR SS 54.6. Applicants must retain certain information on clinical investigators' financial interests and arrangements (21 CFR SS 54.6(a)) and permit FDA employees to have access to the information and to copy the records at reasonable times (21 CFR SS 54.6(b)(2)). Records are to be maintained for two years after the date of approval of the application (21 CFR SS 54.6(b)(1)).\n\nAdditionally, IND and IDE sponsors are required to maintain complete and accurate records of financial disclosure information as part of the records for the investigation (21CFR SSS 312.57(b) and 812.140(b)(3)) and to retain the records pursuant to the required retention periods identified in the IND and IDE regulations (21 CFR SSS 312.57(c) and 812.140(d)).\n\nQ: What kind of documentation is necessary for applicants to keep in case questions about certification and/or disclosure arise?\n\nA:: To the extent that applicants have relied on investigators as the source of information about potentially disclosable financial interests and arrangements, the underlying documentation (e.g., copies of executed questionnaires returned by investigators, correspondence on the subject of financial disclosure, mail receipts, etc.) should be retained. Likewise, to the extent that applicants who did not sponsor a covered clinical study rely on information furnished by the sponsor, the underlying documentation, including all relevant correspondence with and reports from the sponsor, should be retained. To the extent that applicants rely upon information available internally, all appropriate financial documentation regarding the financial interests or arrangements in question should be retained. For example, in the case of significant payments of other sorts, applicants should keep documentation including, but not limited to, records of electronic financial transactions, certified mail delivery receipts, etc. (21 CFR SSS 54.6(a), 312.57(b) and 812.140(b)(3).)\n\nIf storage space is a concern, sponsors and applicants may use electronic storage. For example, required records may be scanned as certified copies 23 of the original and stored electronically, as long as the records remain accessible for inspection and copying by FDA (see Question J.1). If electronic records are used, you should consult guidance on electronic storage of clinical trial records under part 11, \"Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations,\"24 for further information about maintaining scanned documents.\n\nFootnote 23: FDA\u2019s guidance on \u201cComputerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations\u201d defines \u201ccertified copy\u201d as a copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by dated signature, as an exact copy having all the same attributes and information as the original.\n\nFootnote 24: This guidance may be accessed at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070266.pdf.\n\nJ FDA Inspections\n\nQ: Will financial disclosure information be reviewed during a bioresearch monitoring program (BIMO) inspection of the sponsor?\n\nAppendix\n\nConsiderations for Collecting\n\nFinancial Disclosure Information\n\nfrom Clinical Investigators\n\nSuggested items to provide to clinical investigators to assist them in complying with financial disclosure reporting requirements:\n\nIdentify the sponsor(s) of the covered clinical study. See Section IV.5.\n\nIdentify whose financial interests and arrangements need to be reported (e.g., clinical investigators, their spouses and dependent children). See Section IV.6.\n\nIdentify the financial interests and arrangements that must be disclosed in detail. See Section III.2 and Question C.1.\n\nNOTE: The threshold amounts apply separately for each sponsor (seeQuestion E.1) but are cumulative for the investigator and his/her spouse and dependent children (seeSection III.2).\n\nEmployment by any sponsor. SeeSection III and Questions B.1 and D.4.\n\nAny compensation by any sponsor in which the value of compensation is affected by study outcome. See Section III.2.1.\n\nAny proprietary interest in the tested product. See Section III.2.2.\n\nAny equity interest in any sponsor of the covered clinical study whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices. See Section III.2.3.\n\nAny equity interest in any sponsor of the covered clinical study if that sponsor is a publicly held company and the interest exceeds $50,000. See Section III.2.4 and Questions C.2 and C.3.\n\nSignificant payments of other sorts (SPOOS) that have a cumulative monetary value of $25,000 or more made to the investigator or the investigator's institution. See Section III.2.5 and Questions C.4, C.5 and C.6.\n\nRemind investigators of obligation to promptly update their financial disclosure information when relevant changes occur during the study and for one year following study completion. See Questions C.2 and D.6.\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.9490532875061035", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Identification of those sponsor employees with a critical \"need-to-know\" and restriction of such information to those individuals only.\n\nEnsuring that individuals with access to the information avoid any subsequent role in the management of the trial and minimize interactions with others in that role.\n\nEnsuring that individuals who have access to such information make every effort to avoid taking actions that will assist others in inferring what the information is.\n\nEnsuring that reports of study findings describe any access to interim data by individuals involved with study management, and steps taken to prevent such access from potentially biasing the study results.\n\n7 Sponsor Interaction with FDA Regarding Use and Operation of DMCs\n\nThere are many situations, several mentioned earlier, in which sponsor consultation with FDA on matters regarding a DMC is advisable.\n\nPlanning the DMC\n\nIn planning a clinical trial, a sponsor makes several decisions regarding use, types of membership, and operations of a DMC. Many of these can be critical to the success of the trial in meeting regulatory requirements. This guidance document is intended to provide general FDA guidance regarding those decisions, but each set of circumstances can raise unique considerations. Issues regarding use of DMCs are appropriate topics for FDA-sponsor meetings (in person or by telephone) at the sponsor's request.\n\nAccessing Interim Data\n\nAs discussed above, accessing interim data by the sponsor carries many risks, not all of which may be fully appreciated by the sponsor. We recommend that sponsors contact FDA before initiating communication with the DMC regarding access to interim data from a trial likely to be an important part of a regulatory submission. While FDA permission is not required, a discussion regarding the potential risks and implications of that action and of methods to limit the risks may contribute to informed decision making.\n\n7.2.1 DMC Recommendations to Terminate the Study\n\nIn almost all cases, a DMC is advisory to the sponsor; the sponsor decides whether to accept recommendations to discontinue a trial. FDA will rarely, if ever, tell a sponsor which decision to make. For trials that may be terminated early because a substantial benefit has been observed, however, consideration may still need to be given to the adequacy of data with regard to other issues such as safety, duration of benefit, outcomes in important subgroups and important secondary endpoints. We recommend that sponsors of trials that could potentially be terminated early for efficacy reasons discuss these issues with FDA prior to implementing the trial, when the statistical monitoring plan and early stopping boundaries are being developed. In these settings, consultation with FDA may provide the sponsor with important information regarding the regulatory and scientific implications of a decision and may lead to better decisions. Sponsors are encouraged to revisit these issues with FDA when considering DMC recommendations for early termination if new issues have arisen and/or if the regulatory implications of early termination were not adequately clarified at the outset of the trial.\n\nFor trials that may be terminated because of safety concerns, timely communication with FDA is often required (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.56(d) (drugs); 21 CFR 812.150 (devices)). In such cases, we recommend that the sponsor initiate discussion as soon as possible about the appropriate course of action, for the trial in question as well as any other use of the investigational product.\n\nWe strongly recommend that sponsors initiate discussion with FDA prior to early termination of any trial implemented specifically to investigate a potential safety concern.\n\n7.2.2 FDA Interaction with DMCs\n\nIn rare cases, we may wish to interact with a DMC of an ongoing trial to ensure that specific issues of urgent concern to FDA are fully considered by the DMC or to address questions to the DMC regarding the consistency of the safety data in the ongoing trial to that in the earlier trials, to optimize regulatory decision-making. An example might be a situation in which FDA is considering a marketing application in which a safety issue is of some concern, and the sponsor has a second trial of the investigational agent ongoing. In such a situation, we might wish to be sure that the DMC for the ongoing trial is aware of the existing safety data contained in the application and is taking those data into consideration in evaluating the interim safety data from the ongoing trial. In such a case, we could request that the sponsor arrange for FDA to communicate with, or even meet with, the DMC (see 21 CFR 312.41(a); 21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)), and care should be taken to minimize the possibility of jeopardizing the integrity of the ongoing trial.\n\nDMC Recommendations for Protocol Changes\n\nA DMC may, in some instances, recommend changes to the study protocol, particularly in the context of their responsibilities for monitoring patient safety. Many protocol changes have little impact on the usefulness of a trial to gain regulatory approval. Certain types of changes to the protocol, however, such as changes in the primary endpoints, could have substantial impact on the validity of the trial and/or its ability to support the desired regulatory decision if they potentially could have been motivated by the interim data. We recommend that sponsors discuss proposed changes of the latter type with FDA before implementation.\n\n8 Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 11.75 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data resources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or suggestions for reducing this burden to:\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM-99)\n\n1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 200N\n\nRockville, MD 20852-1448\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information fund in FDA\n\nregulations. The collections of information in SSSS 312.30, 312.32, 312.38, 312.55, and 312.56 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0014; the collections of information in SS 314.50 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0001; and the collections of information in SSSS 812.35 and 812.150 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0190-0078.\n\nAn agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB Control No. The OMB Control No. for this information collection is 0910-0581 (To find the current expiration date, search for this\n\nOMB Control No. available at https://www.reginfo.gov).\n--------------------\nContext title: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.1474151611328125", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: The information disclosed should provide sufficient detail to allow a clear understanding of the study design and its results, both positive and negative, including:\n\ninformation about the primary outcome(s) of the study;\n\nthe number and nature of adverse events associated with the test article;\n\nwhether the study was terminated, and the basis for that decision.\n\nNote that the information to be disclosed about the results of investigations conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 is also subject to the regulations regarding the promotion of investigational drugs and devices. A sponsor or investigator shall not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug or device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation, or otherwise promote the drug or device (21 CFR 312.7(a) and 812.7(a)).\n\n86 What is meant by \"completion\" of the clinical investigation?\n\nCompletion of the clinical investigation means the date that all study subjects have been enrolled and follow-up of primary endpoint data on all subjects has been completed in accordance with the clinical protocol. For studies that involve more than one study site, the sponsor may consider completion of the study to occur when data from all of the study sites have been submitted to the sponsor.\n\n87 What is meant by \"termination\" of the clinical investigation?\n\nTermination of the clinical investigation refers to a situation in which a study ends or is discontinued before its planned completion (e.g., if a data monitoring committee determines that a study ethically requires termination following interim analysis of study data).45\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 812.3(q): \u201cTermination means a discontinuance, by sponsor or by withdrawal of IRB or FDA approval, of an investigation before completion.\u201d\n\nDoes FDA expect sponsors to publicly disclose information about studies that have been terminated/discontinued?\n\nYes. FDA expects sponsors to publicly disclose information about studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 that have been terminated or discontinued in the same way that sponsors must disclose information about studies that have been completed. Note that sponsors must report to FDA when a study is terminated or discontinued (21 CFR 312.31(a)(2), 812.150(b)(7)), and it is FDA's expectation that the public also be informed of terminations/discontinuances.\n\nThe agency has previously stated that there must be a scientific need to conduct clinical investigations involving subjects who are unable to consent; if previous investigations have already provided a scientific answer to a particular question, this information should be shared broadly with the research community. In the interests of limiting the number of studies that involve subjects who are not able to provide informed consent, it is FDA's position that \"...broadly sharing both positive and negative results of research with the scientific community may reduce or eliminate unnecessary duplication of research that has been conducted and verified by others.\"46\n\nFootnote 46: 61 Fed. Reg. 51516-51517 (Comments 75-77)\n\n9 Who is responsible for disclosing information about the study after it is completed or terminated?\n\nThe sponsor is responsible for analyzing the results of the overall investigation, including the demographic characteristics of the research population, and for ensuring that these results are published and/or reported.\n\n90 When should the sponsor disclose the results of the study?\n\nDisclosure of the study results to the community(ies) should occur within a reasonable period of time following completion or termination of the investigation. For a multi-site investigation, this disclosure may require waiting until the data from all sites have been analyzed by the sponsor. FDA recommends that such disclosures occur within 1 year after the date the study was completed or terminated. (See alsoQuestions 86 and 87 for a discussion of study \"completion\" and \"termination,\" respectively.)\n\n91. Would reporting results of the investigation in the ClinicalTrials.gov database be sufficient for purposes of meeting the public disclosure requirements under 21 CFR 50.24 \"after the study is completed\"?\n\nNo. Such reporting, similar to publication of results in a scientific or medical journal, would likely satisfy the requirement to \"apprise...researchers about the study, including demographic characteristics of the research population and its results.\" However, the information must also be disclosed to the community from which subjects are drawn and the community in which the research takes place (i.e., lay persons, members of the general public). The IRB should review plans to disclose information \"following completion of the clinical investigation,\" to assure that the plans address appropriate ways of disclosing the results to both the lay and research communities (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iii)).\n\n92. How should the information be disclosed to the community in which the clinical investigation was conducted and the community from which the subjects were drawn (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iii))?\n\nSponsors and clinical investigators should use appropriate mechanisms (e.g., news articles, television or radio programs, community meetings) to provide information about the results of the research to the community(ies) in which the clinical investigation was conducted and from which research subjects were drawn. It is up to the IRB to determine whether the methods described in the public disclosure plans are appropriate for the intended audience.\n\n93. How can information about the results of the study be disclosed to other researchers?\n\nSufficient information may be contained in a scientific publication of the results of the completed or terminated investigation or in submissions to ClinicalTrials.gov; it may also be communicated by other means (e.g., symposia, abstracts, posting on websites).\n\n94. Must information that is disclosed after the study is completed or terminated be submitted to FDA's Public Docket?\n\nYes. See 21 CFR 56.109(g), 312.54, and 812.47(a). (See also Question 84 for more information about submission of information that has been disclosed.)\n\nX Contact of Legally Authorized Representatives or Family Members\n\nContact with a subject's legally authorized representative or family member may occur at various points during the study (e.g., prior to administration of the test article, after administration of the test article, after a subject dies). This section discusses the procedures that must be developed for contacting a subject's legally authorized representative or family member at each of these points.\n\n5.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor each subject unable to provide informed consent, the clinical investigator participating in emergency research must commit to attempting to seek written informed consent within the therapeutic window, if feasible, from the subject's legally authorized representative (LAR; 21 CFR 50.24(a)(5)). If no LAR is available, the clinical investigator must commit to attempting to contact a family member to provide an opportunity to object to the participation of an individual, before administering the test article without informed consent, if feasible (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(v)).\n\n2.3 What procedures for contacting a subject's legally authorized representative (LAR) or family member prior to administration of the test article are required by 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nIRBs must find and document that procedures are in place for contacting and providing information to a subject's LAR or family member within the therapeutic window or at the earliest feasible opportunity (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) and (a)(7)(v)).\n\nFDA anticipates that such procedures and information will likely parallel those approved by the IRB for use in obtaining informed consent from subjects or their LARs. IRBs must review, approve, and document that procedures are in place to be used (1) in attempting to obtain informed consent from a LAR, and (2) if no LAR is available, in attempting to contact a family member and provide an opportunity for the family member to object, as soon as is feasible, ideally, prior to enrolling a subject in the study and administering the test article (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6); see also section \"IV. Therapeutic Window\").\n\n2.4 How can IRBs ensure that investigators make every attempt to contact the subject's legally authorized representative (LAR) or family member within the therapeutic window?\n\nThe IRB must review the procedures that will be used to attempt to contact the subject's LAR or family member within the therapeutic window, if feasible (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6)). In addition, the investigator is required to summarize efforts made to contact LARs and family members, and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5) and (7)(v)).\n\nIn order to summarize efforts to contact LARs and family members, the investigator may develop his/her own procedures or methods to document how this requirement is carried out. Examples of possible methods, include (but are not limited to):\n\nThe investigator/site staff may record in the case history for each subject information about efforts that were made to contact the subject's LAR or family member (e.g., date, time, name of individual to be contacted, method of contact [phone, in person], success or failure of the effort to contact the LAR/family member, staff member who attempted the contact).\n\nThe investigator may develop a checklist that reflects the required steps for contacting the LAR or family member. The checklist could be completed for each subject who is enrolled in the study, and included in the subject's case history or retained elsewhere in the study records.\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.322295188903809"], "As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: A summary of start-up, shutdown, pause and restart procedures, as applicable, to describe how the integrated CM process functions\n\nThe strategy for material collection and diversion including the criteria that should be met for product collection during routine manufacturing\n\nProcess parameters related to continuous flow (e.g., mass flow rate(s) or flow rate range)\n\nWhen appropriate (e.g., movement of solid materials), a description of how the material is transported from one piece of equipment to another\n\nA flow diagram with the following aspects identified, when applicable:\n\nClear indication of the continuous and batch process steps\n\nCritical steps and location points at which process controls, intermediate tests, or final product controls are conducted (e.g., PAT measurement, feedforward or feedback process control)\n\nA suitably detailed description of any aspects of equipment design, configuration and system integration that were shown during development to be critical to process control or to impact product quality\n\nControl Strategy\n\nThe control strategy of a CM process is designed to ensure that output materials made over time are of the desired quality.

FDA recommends that you include information on the basis and rationale for the change(s), where applicable.\n\nSupporting Information and Analysis\n\nSupporting information submitted with the CP should demonstrate your understanding of those aspects of the product, manufacturing process, risk, and control strategy that are relevant to the proposed change(s).\n\nThe supporting information should include the following, as applicable:\n\nPrior knowledge32 used to justify the proposed CMC change(s)\n\nA summary of the risk assessment of the proposed change(s) The risk assessment should identify the potential effects of the change(s) on product quality.33 The extent of the risk assessment should be commensurate with the level of risk associated with the proposed change(s). If multiple changes are proposed for simultaneous implementation or if a specified type of change will be made repeatedly over the life cycle of the product, the risk assessment should also address the potential for cumulative effects of these changes on product quality. Footnote 32: See footnote 33: A number of different approaches can be taken to perform risk assessments of the potential effects of the change(s) on product quality (see ICH Q8(R2), ICH Q9, and ICH Q11 for more information on possible approaches).\n\nInformation from development of the drug substance and its manufacturing process and/or pharmaceutical development that contributes to the scientific and technological understanding of a proposed change(s) and its predicted effDevelopment batches used to support the CP should be described according to batch size or scale, site, date of manufacture, route and/or process used, and intended purpose.\n\nAny studies conducted to gain an increased understanding of the proposed change(s) and the predicted effects on product quality. For example, studies at less than commercial scale (e.g., mechanistic evaluations, design of experiments, modeling, simulations) to identify the relationship between material attributes and process parameters to product quality attributes can be used to gain such an understanding. Also, process analytical technology (PAT)34 can be used to enhance understanding and control of the manufacturing process. Footnote 34: See FDA guidance for industry PAT\u2013A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance (September 2004).\n\nA discussion regarding the suitability of the control strategy, and if applicable, any changes needed to the control strategy to accommodate the planned CMC change(s).\n\nThe amount of supporting information that should be provided depends on, and is commensurate with, the complexity of the product, manufacturing process, and the planned change. For any information that is already submitted in the same NDA, ANDA, or BLA, you should simply indicate where this information can be found (e.g., provide the section number and sequence number, or volume and page number).\n\nAppendix D Comparability Protocol for the Proposed CMC Change(s)\n\nThe CP for the proposed CMC change(s) should describe the specific tests and studies to be performed, including analytical procedures to be used, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the lack of adverse effect on product quality. The overall design of the CP should take into account your understanding of the product, manufacturing process, risks, and control strategy that are relevant to the proposed change(s). The intended use of the product should also be taken into account. The level of detail that should be provided in the CP depends on the complexity of the product, manufacturing process, and the proposed change(s), as well as the specific risks to product quality associated with the proposed change(s).\n\nFor a proposed product and/or manufacturing process change(s), the CP should typically include a comparative assessment of relevant product quality attributes before and after the change(s). A side-by-side comparison should be performed, if possible. A CP developed without such a side-by-side comparison should include appropriate justification.35 A CP should identify the material(s) that may be affected by the proposed CMC change(s) (e.g., in-process material, drug substance, intermediate, reagent, product component, drug product, container closure system, raw material or a combination of these, as appropriate)36 and the material(s) that will be assessed in the tests and studies based on your risk assessment for the proposed change(s). The comparative assessment should be performed at commercial manufacturing scale, except where less than commercial scale is justified.37 The projected number of batches, batch size or scale, site of manufacture, and manufacturing process to be used should be provided.\n\nFootnote 36: See footnote 19 and ICH Q7 and ICH Q11.\n\nFootnote 37: Analysis of commercial scale batches should be included for implementation to assess the effect of the change on the product, except where not feasible (e.g., viral clearance studies). Other studies at less than commercial scale can be submitted as supporting information (see section IV.C.).\n\nThe selection of the relevant tests and studies to be performed should be scientifically justified and based on the risk assessment for the proposed change(s). You should confirm that the routine quality controls (e.g., conformance to specifications, meeting process controls, annual stability batch testing) will be appropriate to ensure continued product quality after implementation of the CMC change(s). However, routine quality controls alone are generally not considered adequate to assess the impact of CMC changes since they are chosen to confirm the routine quality of the product rather than to fully characterize it. In addition to the routine quality controls, relevant characterization and other tests and studies (e.g., structural characterization, impurities characterization, comparative multipoint dissolution profiles, extractables/leachables studies, biological characterization, stability studies, as appropriate) to assess the potential effects of the proposed change(s) and to ensure continued product quality should be specified in the CP. A plan for comparison of impurity profiles before and after a change should be included, as appropriate. Stability studies (e.g., long-term, accelerated, forced degradation), when needed, should provide a comparison of products manufactured before and after the change(s) to ensure that the product will maintain quality throughout its shelf life after implementation of the proposed change(s). Any other studies based on your risk assessment also should be included, where appropriate.\n\nAnalytical procedures should be described in the CP or incorporated by reference if previously submitted in your application. The analytical procedures should be capable of providing the information needed to assess the effects of the proposed change(s) and ensure product quality. Information to support that the analytical procedures are appropriate for their intended purpose also should be provided or incorporated by reference. You should use analytical procedures, sampling methodologies, and statistical methods, where appropriate, that provide a scientifically valid assessment of product quality.38 Such procedures can include online determinations and statistical analysis. Data analysis methods and their selection and development should be described, including statistical methods to be used.\n\nFootnote 38: You must comply, as applicable, with 21 CFR 211.160.\n\nAcceptance criteria to be achieved that ensure the quality of the product after implementation of the CMC change(s) should be specified in the CP. You should confirm that the acceptance criteria established for routine quality controls are appropriate for the CP. In addition to acceptance criteria for routine quality controls, relevant acceptance criteria to be achieved demonstrating that the change(s) was successful should be specified for each characterization test and study. You should include acceptance criteria related to the success of the change(s) for impurity profiles, stability studies, and any other studies, where applicable. Acceptance criteria may also include statistical analysis, such as analysis of data for trends and/or analysis of variability to ensure the continued quality of the product. If the acceptance criteria for the change(s) allow for differences in product quality attributes, you should provide justification based on your assessment of the effect(s) of the change(s) on safety and effectiveness. If you anticipate such differences, they should be prospectively described.\n\nFor a CP that includes a proposed specification change, the CP should provide for a comparison of the approved and proposed specifications to demonstrate that the proposed specification will provide the same or greater assurance of product quality as the current specification.39\n\nFootnote 39: See ICH guidance for industry Q2(R1) Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology (November 2005) (ICH Q2(R1)), FDA guidance for industry Analytical Procedures and Methods Validation for Drugs and Biologics (July 2015), and the Appendix for further details.\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.162238121032715", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: 1.1.1 Changes That Do Not Involve New Starting Materials14 or Intermediates\n\nExamples include the following types of changes that might be made in one or more steps of the synthetic process, purification processes, or reprocessing operations:\n\nFootnote 14: Changes in a supplier of starting materials need not be submitted to the Agency except for those situations described in section I or when a firm has made a commitment to the Agency to do so.\n\nChanges in unit operations (e.g., addition, deletion, change in the order, repetition of an existing unit operation on a routine basis)\n\nAddition or deletion of raw materials (e.g., solvents, reagents) or ancillary materials (e.g., resins, processing aids)\n\nChanges in solvent composition (other than for an analytical procedure, which would be covered under Specification Changes)\n\nOperating conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, reagent stoichiometry, time)15 Footnote 15: Changes to operating conditions that are scale- or equipment-related or are within established or validated ranges need not be reported.\n\n1.2 Documentation of equivalence is recommended for most, but not all, cases. For example, if the amount of charcoal used in a process is increased, equivalence testing may not be warranted.

If either the impurity profile or physical properties are not equivalent in the drug substance, applicants still wishing to make the change should submit a prior approval supplement. When equivalence is not established, applicants should consider conducting an assessment of the effect of the change on the safety and effectiveness of the drug product (e.g., qualification of impurities, bioequivalence studies).

The comparability protocol would provide (1) information that is typically provided in a stability protocol, such as the number and type of batches that will be studied, test conditions, and test time points or (2) a reference to the currently approved stability protocol. The amount of stability data that will be generated before the product made with the change is distributed would be specified. The plan for evaluating stability could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and available manufacturing information. In some cases, no stability studies may be warranted or a commitment to report results from stability studies in an AR can be sufficient. If no stability studies are planned, we recommend that this be stated clearly.\n\nThe differences, if any, in the tests and studies from those previously reported in the approved application or subsequent updates (i.e., supplements, annual reports) would be described. We recommend you identify the location in your application of any referenced tests or studies.\n\niv.2.3 Analytical Procedures to be Used\n\nA protocol should specify the analytical procedures that you intend to use to assess the effect of the CMC changes on the product or intermediate material. Analytical procedures would be chosen capable of detecting new impurities or other changes in a product that can result from the change.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]\n\nmade under the comparability protocol, the specification can be updated and provided when a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA.\n\niv.2.5 Data to Be Reported Under or Included With the Comparability Protocol\n\nYou should identify the type (e.g., release, long-term or accelerated stability data) and amount of data (e.g., 3-months accelerated stability data) that will be submitted at the time a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA and, when appropriate, generated prior to your distributing the product made with the change (e.g., when proposed reporting category is a CBE-30, CBE-0, or AR).\n\nIf available, you can include any data from studies performed to assess the feasibility of the proposed change with the proposed comparability protocol. Data obtained from a small-scale process or other studies incorporating the proposed change can provide preliminary evidence that the change is feasible, as well as preliminary information on the effect of the change on the product. Development or feasibility studies can provide insight into the relevance and adequacy of the choice of the battery of tests you have identified to assess the product.\n\niv.2.6 Proposed Reporting Category\n\nThe use of an approved comparability protocol may justify a reduction in the reporting category for the particular CMC change when implemented (see III.A). We recommend you include a proposal for the reporting category that you would use for changes implemented using the approved comparability protocol. FDA will evaluate your proposed reporting category as part of its review of the comparability protocol and communicate any concerns about your proposal. Agreement by the applicant and FDA on the reporting category for the specified CMC changes will be part of the process of approving the comparability protocol.\n\niv.2.7 Equivalence Not Demonstrated Using the Approved Comparability Protocol\n\nIt is anticipated that some changes in the manufacturing process will result in a postchange product that cannot be demonstrated to be equivalent to the prechange product without more extensive physicochemical, biological, pharmacology, PK/PD, efficacy, or safety testing or in a product that does not meet the prespecified acceptance criteria in the protocol. You should identify in the protocol the steps you will take in such circumstances.\n\niv.2.8 Commitment\n\nYou should include a commitment in your comparability protocol that you will update or withdraw your protocol when it becomes obsolete (see section IV.D.)Does FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in the Manufacturing Process That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?*\n\nIn addition to the general considerations provided in section V.A, we recommend that you consider the following issues for changes in the manufacturing process, where applicable:\n\nv.2.1 Comparison of Physical Characteristics\n\nA comparability protocol would normally include a plan to compare the physical characteristics (e.g., polymorph forms, particle size distribution) of the product produced using the old and new processes when these characteristics are relevant to the safety and/or efficacy of the product.\n\nv.2.2 Comparison of Impurity Profiles\n\nA comparability protocol would include a plan to determine the impurity profile of the product produced using the new process. The studies would assess product-related impurities and process-related impurities, including, if applicable in-process reagents and catalysts. We recommend that attention be given to demonstrating the absence of any new impurities or contaminants, or that they are removed or inactivated by downstream processing. Any changes in the impurity profile would meet the predefined criteria (see section V.A.4). The predefined criteria would indicate when qualification studies will be warranted to evaluate an increased level of an existing impurity or a new impurity (or an applicant could reference a relevant FDA guidance that recommends qualification levels).\n\nIf during implementation of a change under an approved comparability protocol, the data indicate that nonclinical or clinical qualification studies for impurities are warranted, the change would not be appropriate for implementation under the approved comparability protocol (see III.C and V.A.7)\n\nv.2.3 Effect on Downstream Processes\n\nWe recommend that the effect of the change on downstream processes be examined. Downstream processes such as purification steps can be affected by higher product yields or shifts in impurity profiles when upstream processes are modified. For example, adventitious agent removal or inactivation may have to be reassessed for processes involving materials or reagents derived from a biological source. A comparability protocol would discuss how to ensure that the entire manufacturing process is adequately controlled.\n\nv.2.4 Effect on Process Controls and Controls of Intermediates and/or In-process Materials\n\nWe recommend you identify and justify implementation of new controls or variations from approved controls. We recommend a statement be included that controls, including those that have been validated to inactivate and remove impurities or contaminants, will be revalidated for the new production process, if appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Analytical Procedures That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nA comparability protocol for changing an analytical procedure would provide the plan for validation of the changed analytical procedure and indicate whether the protocol will be used to modify the existing analytical procedure (i.e., retaining the same principle), or to change from one analytical procedure to another (e.g., normal to reverse phase HPLC). The comparability protocol would be designed to demonstrate that the proposed changes in the analytical procedures improve or do not significantly change characteristics used in methods validation that are relevant to the type of analytical procedure (e.g., accuracy, precision, specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, range).8\n\nFootnote 8: Guidance on validation of analytical procedures can be found in the CVM/VICH guidances GFI #63/GL1 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Definition and Terminology and GFI #64/GL2 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology.\n\nMethods validation includes an assessment of the suitability of the analytical procedure. A validation plan would have prespecified acceptance criteria for relevant validation parameters such as precision, range, accuracy, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit. The proposed acceptance criteria for these parameters would ensure that the analytical procedure is appropriate for its intended use. The validation plan would assess whether a revised procedure is more susceptible than the original procedure to matrix effects by process buffers/media, product-related contaminants, or other components present in the dosage form. A plan would identify any statistical analyses that will be performed and whether product testing to compare the two procedures is intended. The need and plan for providing product testing to compare the two procedures could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and type of test (e.g., chemical, biological).\n\nWhen used for release or process control, use of the new revised analytical procedure should not result in deletion of a test or relaxation of acceptance criteria that are described in the approved application.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Manufacturing Equipment That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nComparability protocols may be most useful if applicants are planning to change to equipment with a different operating principal. Equipment changes are often made in conjunction with changes to the manufacturing process. We recommend that you evaluate this type of change with respect to its effect on the production process prior to deciding whether or not a comparability protocol would be appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changing Manufacturing Facilities That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.067084312438965", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Demonstration of state of control with the modified/changed manufacturing process might include, but is not limited to, such items as:\n\nEstablishment of modified specifications for raw, source and starting materials, and reagents;\n\nAppropriate bioburden and/or viral safety testing of the postchange cell banks and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age for production;\n\nAdventitious agent clearance;\n\nRemoval of product- or process-related impurities, such as residual host cell DNA and proteins; and\n\nMaintenance of the purity level.\n\nFor approved products, an appropriate number of postchange batches should be analyzed to demonstrate consistent performance of the process.\n\nTo support the analysis of the changes and the control strategy, the manufacturer should prepare a description of the change that summarizes the prechange and the postchange manufacturing process and that clearly highlights modifications of the process and changes in controls in a side-by-side format.\n\nDemonstration of Comparability During Development (2.4)\n\nDuring product development, it is expected that multiple changes in the manufacturing process will occur that could impact drug product quality, safety, and efficacy. Comparability exercises are generally performed to demonstrate that nonclinical and clinical data generated with prechange product are applicable to postchange product in order to facilitate further development and, ultimately, to support the marketing authorization. Comparability studies conducted for products in development are influenced by factors such as the stage of product development, the availability of validated analytical procedures, and the extent of product and process knowledge, which are limited at times due to the available experience that the manufacturer has with the process.\n\nWhere changes are introduced in development before nonclinical studies, the issue of assessing comparability is not generally raised because the manufacturer subsequently conducts\n\nnonclinical and clinical studies using the postchange product as part of the development process. During early phases of nonclinical and clinical studies, comparability testing is generally not as extensive as for an approved product. As knowledge and information accumulate, and the analytical tools develop, the comparability exercise should utilize available information and will generally become more comprehensive. Where process changes are introduced in late stages of development and no additional clinical studies are planned to support the marketing\n\nauthorization, the comparability exercise should be as comprehensive and thorough as one\n\nconducted for an approved product. Some outcomes of the comparability studies on quality attributes can lead to additional nonclinical or clinical studies.\n\nIn order for a comparability exercise to occur during development, appropriate assessment tools should be used. Analytical procedures used during development might not be validated, but should always be scientifically sound and provide results that are reliable and reproducible. Due to the limitations of the analytical tools in early clinical development, physicochemical and biological tests alone might be considered inadequate to determine comparability; therefore, bridging nonclinical and/or clinical studies, as appropriate, might be needed.\n\nNonclinical and Clinical Considerations (2.5)\n\n2.5.1 Factors To Be Considered in Planning Nonclinical and Clinical Studies (2.5.1)\n\nDeterminations of product comparability can be based solely on quality considerations (see section 2.2) if the manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies as suggested in this document. Additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is considered appropriate when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability. The extent and nature of nonclinical and clinical studies will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consideration of various factors, which include among others:\n\nQuality findings\n\nDrug product -- The type, nature, and extent of differences between the postchange product and the prechange product with respect to quality attributes including product-related substances, the impurity profile, stability, and excipients.

The purpose of these studies is to enable comparison of pre- and postchange product. Where appropriate, these studies should be direct comparative studies.\n\nGLOSSARY (3)\n\nComparability Bridging Study: A study performed to provide nonclinical or clinical data that allows extrapolation of the existing data from the drug product produced by the current process to the drug product from the changed process.\n\nComparable: A conclusion that products have highly similar quality attributes before and after manufacturing process changes and that no adverse impact on the safety or efficacy, including immunogenicity, of the drug product occurred. This conclusion can be based on an analysis of product quality attributes. In some cases, nonclinical or clinical data might contribute to the conclusion.\n\nComparability Exercise: The activities, including study design, conduct of studies, and evaluation of data, that are designed to investigate whether the products are comparable.\n\nQuality Attribute: A molecular or product characteristic that is selected for its ability to help indicate the quality of the product.

The CP submission should address any differences in equipment design, operating principles, and/or size, as applicable.77\n\nFootnote 77: See footnote 19 regarding guidances on postapproval CMC changes.\n\nSpecification, Including Analytical Procedure (Method) Changes\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations or issues for industry to consider regarding specification changes in a CP?\n\nSpecifications are the quality standards (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drug substances, products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug substance or product.78 Changes to the approved specification that provide the same or greater assurance of product quality can be included in a CP. A CP submission for a specification change should include a justification for the change.\n\nFor replacement or modification of an existing analytical procedure in an approved application, the new procedure must be scientifically sound79 and should provide the same or greater assurance of product quality than the currently approved procedure.80 The CP should include the specific plan, description of statistical method(s) to be used, and acceptance criteria to be achieved for evaluating the performance of the new procedure. Method validation data should be submitted with the notification of the change.\n\nFootnote 79: See 21 CFR 211.160.\n\nFootnote 80: See ICH Q2(R1) and FDA guidance for industry Analytical Procedures and Methods Validation for Drugs and Biologics (July 2015).\n\nA CP can also be used for replacing a quality reference standard used in an analytical procedure(s).\n\nG. Packaging Changes\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations or issues for industry to consider regarding packaging changes in a CP?\n\nYou can use a CP for packaging changes. The CP can apply to components of the container closure system or their manufacturing processes. CPs for changes to multiple components of a container closure system should adequately address the potential effects of the interchangeability of container closure system components on product quality, where applicable.\n\nH. Process Analytical Technology Changes\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations regarding process analytical technology implementation or changes in a CP?\n\nYou can propose the implementation of process analytical technology (PAT) or propose a change in PAT in a CP. Information on the suitability of a PAT tool on experimental and/or production equipment and processes can be submitted to support a CP for PAT implementation or change(s).81\n\nFootnote 81: See footnote 34.\n\nI. Changes to Drug-Device or Biologic-Device Combination Products\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations regarding changes to drug-device or biologic-device combination products in a CP?\n\nIn general, a CP can be submitted for changes to a drug-device or biologic-device combination product where CDER or CBER is the lead center. The nature of the proposed change to the device constituent part would need to be considered in determining if a CP would be suitable.\n\nFor questions as to whether a CP would be suitable for a specific drug-device or biologic-device combination product, we recommend that you contact the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nJ. Master Files\n\n1. Can a drug master file (DMF) be cross-referenced in a CP that is included in an application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act?\n\nIn an application approved or seeking approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act, a DMF can be cross-referenced82 in a CP that provides for postapproval CMC changes (e.g., addition of a supplier of a drug substance used in an FDA-approved drug product, a change in an excipient supplier, a change in the supplier of a container and/or closure). The CP should indicate the type of CMC information that will be incorporated by reference to the DMF. Also, the CP should include the tests and studies to be performed and the acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the suitability of the material supplied by the DMF holder (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, stability studies). We recommend that the CP submission specify that a copy of the letter authorizing incorporation by reference of the information in the DMF will be provided when reporting a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved CP to FDA. If the subsequent submission notifying FDA of the postapproval CMC change does not include the letter of authorization, the notification to FDA would be incomplete. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the DMF holder's methods, facilities, and controls relevant to the change are in accordance with CGMP. A CP for a change in drug substance supplier is generally not recommended if the proposed change is to a drug substance supplier that does not already supply drug substance used in an FDA-approved drug product (see question and answer A.2).\n\nFootnote 82: See 21 CFR 314.420.\n\n2. Can a master file be cross-referenced in a CP that is included in an application submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act?\n\nIn general, in an application approved or seeking approval under section 351 of the PHS Act, a master file, including a DMF, can be cross-referenced83 in a CP that provides for postapproval CMC changes (e.g., changes to the information about excipients or materials used in the preparation of drug substance, drug substance intermediate, or drug product), except if the information in the master file is drug substance, drug substance intermediate, or drug product information. The CP should indicate the type of CMC information that will be incorporated by reference to the master file. Also, the CP should include the tests and studies to be performed and the acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the suitability of the material supplied by the master file holder (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, stability studies). We recommend that the CP submission specify that a copy of the letter authorizing incorporation by reference of the information in the master file will be provided when reporting a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved CP to FDA. If the subsequent submission notifying FDA of the postapproval CMC change does not include the letter of authorization, the notification to FDA would be incomplete. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the master file holder's facilities, methods, and controls relevant to the change are in accordance with CGMP.\n\n3.3.3 Can a CP be submitted to a master file?\n\nA CP for postapproval CMC changes can be submitted to a master file, including a DMF, by the master file holder. For example, a CP submitted to a master file may be useful to support changes affecting multiple applications. However, FDA neither independently reviews nor approves or disapproves submissions to master files; instead, FDA reviews a CP or other information in a master file only in connection with applications that incorporate by reference such information. Administrative considerations relating to reviewing CPs in master files can present some unique challenges; therefore, a master file holder should coordinate with FDA prior to submitting such a CP.84\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.3955159187316895"], "As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: The followup report should include:\n\nCorrect information contained in the initial report plus the new data. The new data should be marked (e.g., with an asterisk, highlighted, underlined, etc.). Any attachments submitted in the initial report (e.g., journal articles, discharge summaries) should not be resubmitted.\n\nItem 24b - The same unique manufacturer control number used on the initial report; this is essential to prevent duplicate counting of reports.\n\nItem 24c - The date the followup information was received by the applicant.\n\nItem 25a - Clearly marked \"followup.\"\n\nTo summarize, the followup report (and attachments, if any) must contain the applicant's same unique internal recordkeeping number (control number, Item 24b on Form FDA 1639) as the initial report.\n\nIf the initial report was submitted as a 15-day report, the followup report should be submitted as a 15-day followup report even if the followup information shows that the event was labeled or not serious. Conversely, a 15-day followup report should be submitted if the event is found to be serious and unlabeled, even if the original report was not submitted as a 15-day report.\n\nDO NOT submit a followup report if additional relevant information is not obtained. However, the documentation of the procedure followed in seeking to obtain the additional information should be maintained. FDA may request this documentation.\n\nFifteen-day followup reports should not be submitted in the same envelope with periodic reports. \"15-Day Alert Report\" should be marked on the outside envelope of the 15-day followup reports.\n\nDO NOT submit a followup report when reporting a different experience in a patient for whom a previous experience was reported and submitted. Submit an initial report with a new control number (Item 24b) on a Form FDA-1639 for a new, subsequent experience. Thus, a followup report follows an experience, not a patient.\n\nV. How and Where to Report\n\nWhat and Where to Report\n\nFor prescription drugs without approved NDA's, ANDA's, or antibiotic applications, adverse experience reports should be sent as single copies to:\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nFor drugs with approved NDA's, ANDA's, or antibiotic\n\napplications, all 15-day Form FDA 1639 reports of serious, unlabeled\n\nevents; 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious,\n\nlabeled events; periodic reports; followup reports, and letters\n\nstating no reports were received during the reporting period should\n\nbe sent in duplicate to:\n\nCentral Document Room\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nPark Building, Room 214\n\n12420 Parklawn Drive\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nAll submissions must be legible, preferably typewritten.\n\nLegible photostatic copies are acceptable. However, visual contrast\n\nmust be adequate to assure clear readable microfilm copies.\n\nIf the applicant becomes aware of a reportable adverse event, the applicant is responsible for transferring the information to a Form FDA 1639 (and narrative increased frequency report if indicated) and submitting it to FDA. If it is a serious, unlabeled event, the Form FDA 1639 should be submitted within 15 days. The applicant should not assume the reporting requirements are fulfilled by asking the initial reporter to return a Form FDA 1639 to the applicant or FDA. The applicant should not wait for the reporter to complete a Form FDA 1639 before submitting a report of a serious, unlabeled event to FDA. A 15-day report can and should be submitted based only on verbal information.\n\nAll ADE reports, except 15-day narrative increased frequency reports, should be reported on a Form FDA 1639. (Detailed guidelines for narrative increased frequency reports are in Appendix C.)\n\nHow To Obtain Copies of Form FDA 1639\n\nTo obtain up to 10 copies of Form FDA 1639 write to:\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730)\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n5600 Fishers Lane, Room 15B-31\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nAdditional copies can be obtained from:\n\nPHS Forms and Publications Distribution Center (HFA-268)\n\n12100 Parklawn Drive\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nCopies of blank Form FDA 1639 can also be duplicated by the applicant.\n\nComputerized Forms\n\nIn lieu of using the preprinted Form FDA 1639, a computer-generated report may be submitted if it contains all of the elements of information in the identical enumerated sequence of Form FDA 1639, is completed in accordance with this guideline, and is forwarded with the appropriate number of copies. The typeset must be large and clear enough to assure readable microfilm copies.\n\nEach applicant's use of a modified form must be preapproved by FDA in writing.\n\nElectronic Submissions\n\nElectronically produced adverse drug experience reports may be submitted; however, each applicant must obtain prior written approval.\n\nAt this time, only periodic reports may be submitted electronically. Fifteen-day reports (serious, unlabeled events and an increase in frequency of serious, labeled events) may not be submitted electronically. Also, followup reports (to both 15-day and non-15-day reports) may not be submitted electronically.\n\nCIOMS Forms for Foreign Reports\n\nThe Council for International Organizations for Medical Sciences (CIOMS), working with several member nations and industry, has developed a format (resembling Form FDA 1639) for international ADE reporting. With prior written approval, this format can be used for reporting foreign adverse experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nQuestions or Comments about Reporting Formats\n\nRequests for approval of reporting formats (computerized forms, electronic submissions, CIOMS formats, etc.) should be addressed to:\n\nSurveillance and Data Processing Branch (HFD-737)\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-6414\n\nQuestions about Determining and Reporting Increased Frequencies\n\nQuestions about determining increased frequencies should be addressed to:\n\nEpidemiology Branch (HFD-733)\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-2306Other Questions and Comments\n\nGeneral questions or comments about this guideline or ADE reporting should be addressed to:\n\nReports Evaluation Branch\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-735)\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-4580\n\nVI. Special Situations\n\nA number of special situations occur that may seemingly complicate reporting requirements. Following are several:\n\na. Scientific Literature Reports\n\nSerious, unlabeled adverse events that are reported in the literature (or as an unpublished manuscript) must be submitted as 15-day reports on Form FDA 1639.\n\nA copy of the article or manuscript must be attached to the completed Form FDA 1639.\n\nA separate Form FDA 1639 must be completed for each identifiable patient (with an identifiable adverse event). Thus, if an article describes six patients with a given adverse experience, six Form FDA 1639's should be completed.\n\nWhen an ADE is based on a foreign language article or manuscript, the applicant is expected to translate the publication into English promptly. The original article or manuscript and translation should be attached to the submitted Form FDA 1639.\n\nAll literature reports and manuscript reports should be marked \"Literature\" in Item 24d.\n\nIf multiple drug products are mentioned in the article, Form FDA 1639 should be submitted only by the manufacturer whose drug is the suspect drug.\n\nThe suspect drug is that identified by the article's author, and is usually mentioned in the article's title.\n\nb. Postmarketing, Clinical Trial, or Surveillance Study of Drugs Involving ADE Monitoring\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a study refers to a formal research effort including a protocol with specific objectives and a scientific methodology for collecting and analyzing ADE data. Anything less rigorous should be treated as a spontaneous report.\n\nThe only experiences from studies that should be considered for submission to FDA under 21 CFR 310.305 or 314.80 are those that would be reported as (1) 15-day reports of serious, unlabeled events and (2) 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious, labeled events. These should be reported only if there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that the event is causally related to the drug exposure.\n\nEvents reportable from investigational new drug (IND) trials (with marketed drugs) also must be submitted to the IND as described in 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nFor each ADE, a suspect drug must be identified. Thus, for blinded studies, reports shall be completed only after the code is broken.\n\nPostmarketing, clinical trial, and surveillance studies as described in this section and under 21 CFR 310.305 or 314.80(e) refer to studies specifically monitoring adverse effects of the drug. Adverse events incidental to other types of studies should be treated as spontaneous reports.\n\nc. Foreign Reports\n\nOnly 15-day reports of serious, unlabeled events and 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious, labeled events are required to be submitted with respect to foreign reports. Other foreign reports, including serious, labeled events and all nonserious events, are not required to be submitted. However, reports of serious, labeled events should be available and submitted to FDA if requested.\n\nReports are also to be submitted if the foreign ADE is for a product that has the same active moiety as the product marketed in the United States. This is true even if the excipients, dosage forms, strengths, routes of administration, and indications vary.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guideline for Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.6359949111938477", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: In any scheme to optimize the value of follow-up, the first consideration should be prioritization of case reports by importance. The priority for follow-up should be as follows: cases which are 1) serious and unexpected, 2) serious and expected, and 3) non-serious and unexpected. In addition to seriousness and expectedness as criteria, cases \"of special interest\" also deserve extra attention as a high priority (e.g., ADRs under active surveillance at the request of the regulators), as well as any cases that might lead to a labeling change decision.\n\nFollow-up information should be obtained, via a telephone call and/or site visit and/or a written request. The company should provide specific questions it would like to have answered. Follow-up methods should be tailored towards optimizing the collection of missing information. Written confirmation of details given verbally should be obtained whenever possible. In exceptional circumstances, if requests for information have been refused by the reporter, a regulatory authority might be able to assist an MAH in obtaining follow-up data.\n\nTo facilitate the capture of clinically relevant and complete information, use of a targeted questionnaire/specific form is encouraged, preferably at the time of the initial report. Ideally, healthcare professionals with thorough pharmacovigilance training and therapeutic expertise should be involved in the collection and the direct follow-up of reported cases (particularly those of medical significance). For serious ADRs, it is important to continue follow-up and report new information until the outcome has been established or the condition is stabilized. How long to follow up such cases is a matter of judgment.\n\nIt is important that at the time of the original report, sufficient details about the patient and reporter be collected and retained to enable future investigations, within the constraints imposed by local data privacy laws.\n\n5.4.1 Pregnancy Exposure\n\nMAHs are expected to follow up all pregnancy reports from healthcare professionals or consumers where the embryo/foetus could have been exposed to one of its medicinal products. When an active substance, or one of its metabolites, has a long half-life, this should be taken into account when considering whether a foetus could have been exposed (e.g., if medicinal products taken before the gestational period should be considered).\n\nHow to Report\n\nThe CIOMS I form has been a widely accepted standard for expedited adverse event reporting. However, no matter what the form or format used, it is important that certain basic information/data elements, when available, be included with any expedited report, whether in a tabular or narrative presentation. It is recommended that the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) be used for coding medical information. The standards for electronic submission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs), according to the ICH E2B/M2 guidelines, should be implemented.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2D_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.264932632446289", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: [472] Lssues Not Raised During the Inspection\n\n[473] If, during an inspection, an investigator notes what appears to be an objectionable condition and a manufacturer disagrees with that observation, the manufacturer should voice its disagreement with the investigator. By doing so, the investigator has the opportunity to evaluate the manufacturer's position and consult, as needed, with Agency experts. The Agency may not\n\n[474] accept a request for dispute resolution concerning a disagreement that was not initially raised by the manufacturer during the inspection unless a manufacturer can provide a reasonable\n\n[475] explanation why it did not present relevant information during the inspection.\n\n[476] V. Communication of Dispute Resolution Decisions\n\n[477] FDA believes that decisions made in the dispute resolution process, along with all supporting documentation, should be publicly available consistent with FDA's disclosure regulations (21 CFR Part 20) and applicable statutes, unless the decisions involve information that would otherwise be withheld under these regulations and statutes. The Agency will redact, as appropriate, any documents requested through the Freedom of Information process.\n\n[478] When appropriate, a summary of the relevant issues and Agency views will be provided in a question and answer format and posted on the FDA Web site with all identifying information\n\n[479] excluded. Information gained from these decisions should promote consistent application and interpretation of pharmaceutical CGMP requirements.\n\n[480] VI. Paperwork Reduction ACT OF 1995\n\n[481] This guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 500 3501-3520).\n\n[482] The time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 30 hours to prepare and submit each request for tier-one dispute resolution and 8 hours to prepare and submit each request for tier-two dispute resolution. This includes the time to review instructions, search existing data resources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information\n\n[483] collection.

Depending on the circumstances, these issues may be submitted in a pre-submission and if appropriate, discussed with FDA during a pre-submission meeting.73\n\nFootnote 73: Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm311176.pdf.\n\nShould a sponsor or applicant expect a response to a waiver request?\n\nAnswer: FDA will notify the sponsor or applicant in writing as to whether the waiver request is granted or denied.\n\nWhat if the sponsor or applicant does not hear back from FDA regarding a waiver request?\n\nAnswer: The sponsor or applicant should contact the FDA review division to which the waiver request was submitted to inquire about the status of the waiver request. The sponsor or applicant should not assume that no response means that the request for waiver has been granted.\n\n(2) Public health implications of waiver requests (Section 812.28(c)(2))\n\nUnder what circumstances would a waiver be granted?\n\nAnswer: FDA may grant a waiver if it finds that doing so would be in the interest of the public health.74 The regulation allows the Agency to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to grant or deny a waiver, taking into account all appropriate circumstances.\n\nFootnote 74: 21 CFR 812.28(c)(2).\n\nAppendix D Records (21 CFR 812.28(d))\n\nHow long must a sponsor or applicant retain records required under 21 CFR 812.28?\n\nAnswer: If the OUS clinical investigation is submitted in support of a device marketing application or submission, a sponsor or applicant must retain the required records for at least 2 years after an Agency decision on that application or submission or, if the investigation is submitted in support of an IDE, for 2 years after termination or completion of the IDE.75\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix E Implementation\n\nWhen will this rule be in effect?\n\nAnswer: The effective date is established as one year after the publication of the rule in the Federal Register to provide additional time for sponsors and applicants to make any changes necessary, for example, to their internal operating procedures, study planning, etc., to incorporate the principles of GCP and compliance with the requirements of the rule for investigations that will support an IDE or device marketing application or submission.\n\nWill this rule be applied to clinical investigations begun prior to the effective date?\n\nAnswer: FDA is implementing the rule for clinical investigations that enroll the first subject on or after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this rule, we will consider a subject enrolled when the subject agrees to participate in a clinical investigation as indicated by the subject (or a subject's legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) signing of the informed consent document(s), or participates in a clinical investigation meeting the requirements of section 50.24.\n\nIf an investigation conducted outside the United States enrolled the first subject prior to the rule's effective date, then the requirements in section 814.15 prior to the rule's effective date would apply. Specifically, if data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States that enrolled the first subject prior to the effective date of this rule are submitted in support a PMA application, FDA will accept the data \"if the data are valid and the investigator has conducted the studies in conformance with the 'Declaration of Helsinki' or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever accords greater protection to the human subjects. If the standards of the country are used, the applicant shall state in detail any differences between those standards and the 'Declaration of Helsinki' and explain why they offer greater protection to the human subjects.76\n--------------------\nContext title: Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.125632286071777", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: See 21 CFR 803.52 for additional requirements. You do not need to submit a supplemental report for new information if you would not have been required to report that information had it been known or available at the time you filed your initial MDR.\n\nYou must maintain all supplemental reports in your MDR files [21 CFR 803.18]. You must also document in your files when you decide not to submit any new information in a supplemental report [21 CFR 803.18].\n\nWhat level of effort must I make to obtain additional information or previously unknown information about MDR reportable events?\n\nThe level of effort you make to obtain additional information depends largely on the nature and severity of the event reported. MDR follow-up investigations should involve a \"good faith effort\" to obtain information and should not focus only on the number of attempts to obtain such information.\n\nA \"good faith effort\" to obtain additional information should include at least one written (including email) request for information. Your MDR files should include a record of each attempt to obtain information, and the nature of the response by the reporter [see 21 CFR 803.50(b)(3) and 803.18(e)]. You should make an effort to obtain correct and complete information about the patient outcome. If you receive a report of a device malfunction, you should determine if a patient was involved and, if so, what happened to the patient as a result of the malfunction. If the patient died or suffered a serious injury, then your initial report must reflect that fact [21 CFR 803.52(b)]. If your initial report was submitted as a malfunction and you learn a patient died or suffered a serious injury, then your supplemental report should change the event type to death or serious injury, as appropriate [21 CFR 803.52(f)(1)].\n\nAll of this information is subject to review by us to determine if you made a good faith effort to follow-up and obtain the requested information [21 CFR 803.18(b)(2)].\n\nWhen will you request additional information from me about an event for which I submitted an MDR report?\n\nWe may request that you submit additional information if and when we determine that protection of the public health requires additional or clarifying information [21 CFR 803.15]. In these instances, we will notify you in writing about the additional information required. Any request we make will state the reason or purpose for requesting the information, specify the date by which the information is to be submitted,and clearly relate the request to a reported event. We will confirm all verbal requests for additional information in writing, which may include email [21 CFR 803.15].\n\nThe request for additional information letter will specify how to respond and may provide an email address to use for the response.\n\n2.25 Must reports be made in English?\n\nYes, all written or electronic MDR reports, including any supplemental reports or requested additional information must be in English [21 CFR 803.13(a)].\n\n26 Does the MDR regulation provide for any reporting exemptions, variances, or alternative forms of reporting?\n\nThe regulation explicitly exempts the following three types of persons or entities [21 CFR 803.19(a)]:\n\nLicensed practitioners who prescribe or administer devices intended for use in humans, and who manufacture or import devices solely for use in diagnosing and treating persons with whom the practitioner has a \"physician-patient\" relationship;\n\nAn individual who manufactures devices intended for use in humans solely for such person's use in research or teaching and not for sale, including any person who is subject to alternative reporting requirements under the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulation [21 CFR part 812], which requires the reporting of all adverse device effects; and\n\nDental or optical laboratories.\n\nThe regulation also allows you to submit a written request for an exemption, variance or alternative form of reporting for some or all of the requirements of the MDR regulation [21 CFR 803.19(b) and (c)]. We will review your request and will provide a written response to grant or deny, in whole or in part, such request. An exemption, variance, or alternative form of reporting can also be granted at our discretion in the absence of a request and may impose other reporting requirements to ensure the protection of the public health [21 CFR 803.19(c)]. We can revoke or modify in writing any grant of a written request for an exemption, variance, or alternative form of reporting if we decide that revocation or modification is necessary for the protection of the public health [21 CFR 803.19(d)].\n\nSeveral variances have been issued with alternatives for providing the manufacturer report number (see Section 2.28 of this guidance). An alternative form of reporting may also allow for a modification in the timing of report submissions and may authorize a reduction in the data elements required by 21 CFR Part 803. For example, a firm may request that instead of reporting all of the required information for each event within 30calendar days after becoming aware of the event, that the reports be submitted quarterly, semiannually or annually and contain only a subset of the data required by the MDR regulation.\n\nYou must submit any reports or information required and abide by any conditions specified in our response letter. The conditions imposed in our response will replace or supersede applicable reporting requirements under the MDR regulation until such conditions are revoked or modified [21 CFR 803.19(e)].\n\n27 What information should I include in a request for an exemption, variance, or alternative form of reporting and where should the request be sent?\n\nThe requirements for exemptions and how to request one are found in 21 CFR 803.19(b). We have issued certain guidance documents for exemptions, such as the Alternative Summary Reporting (ASR) and Remedial Action Exemption (RAE) guidance documents (see section 2.28 of this guidance), which contain specific instructions for how you may request certain exemptions. For other exemption requests, you should provide the following information, as applicable:\n\nFirm identification, including reporting site registration number and the name, address, and telephone number of the contact person;\n\nType of exemption requested. For example: * A total exemption from the MDR requirements, or * A request to designate an authorized reporter for manufacturer/importer (see Section 2.32 of this guidance) or specifications developer/contract manufacturer (see section 2.17 of this guidance), where both entities are subject to reporting;\n\nType of events involved (e.g., serious injuries, malfunctions);\n\nDevice identification such as brand name, model, or catalog number and product classification code;\n\nDescription of the specific type of device problem(s) or adverse event(s) you would like us to consider for the exemption or alternative reporting;\n\nJustification for the request, including why you believe FDA does not need to receive the information required by 21 CFR 803.52for the affected events; and\n\nEstimated number of MDR reports filed annually that will be affected by this exemption.\n\nYour written request should be on your firm's letterhead with the original signature of the requester. You may call our MDR Policy Branch if you have any questions or need help. Our telephone number is (301) 796-6670.\n\nYou can mail your written request to:\n\nMDR Policy Branch\n\nDivision of Postmarket Surveillance\n\nOffice of Surveillance and Biometrics\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\n\nBuilding 66 - Room 3217\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nAlternatively, you can send a PDF version of your signed request letter in an e-mail to:\n\nMDRPolicy@fda.hhs.gov\n\n2.28 Have you published any guidance documents describing the\n\nexemptions, variances, and alternative forms of reporting you have issued, and if so, where can I get this information?\n\nYes, we have published the following guidance documents:\n\nAlternative Summary Reporting (ASR) Program.\n\nRemedial Action Exemption; Guidance for FDA and Industry [RAE Guidance Document].\n\nMedical Device Reporting Guidance for User Facilities, Manufacturers, and Importers [Needle sticks].\n\nE1996004 [IOL Exemption].\n\n[Report Number Variance].\n\nNo. 5 [Report Number Variance 5].\n\nElectronic Medical Device Reporting.\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers.\n\n2.29 Where do I send my MDR reports?\n\nAll MDR reports from manufacturers must be submitted to FDA in an electronic format in accordance with 21 CFR803.12(a) and 803.20, unless granted an exemption under 21\n\n2.30 Where do I report a public health emergency?\n\nIf you believe that there is a public health emergency, you may contact: FDA's Office of Crisis Management, Emergency Operations Center by 24 hour telephone at: 301-796-8240 or toll free at 866-300-4374. You should follow your telephone contact with an e-mail to emergency.operations@fda.hhs.gov or a FAX to 301-847-8543 [21 CFR 803.12(c)].\n\nIf you make a report of an emergency by telephone, e-mail, or FAX, and the emergency concerns an MDR reportable event, you are still required to send the report to FDA in an electronic format.

The information should be presented in a logical time sequence; ideally this should be presented in the chronology of the patient's experience, rather than in the chronology in which the information was received. In follow-up reports, new information should be clearly identified.\n* Abbreviations and acronyms should be avoided, with the possible exception of laboratory parameters and units. Key information from supplementary records should be included in the report, and their availability should be mentioned in the narrative and supplied on request. Any autopsy or other post-mortem findings (including a coroner's report) should also be provided when available if allowed by local privacy protection laws. Terms in the narrative should be accurately reflected by appropriate coding.\n* Single Case Evaluation\n* The purpose of careful medical review is to ensure correct interpretation of medical\n* Information. Regardless of the source of an ADR report, the recipient should carefully review the report for the quality and completeness of the medical information.\n* This should include, but is not limited to, consideration of the following:\n* Is a diagnosis possible?\n* Have the relevant diagnostic procedures been performed?\n* Were alternative causes of the reaction(s) considered?\n* What additional information is needed?\n* ADR terms should be used consistently and in accord with recommended standards for diagnosis. The report should include the verbatim term, which quotes the reporter.\n* Staff receiving reports should provide an unbiased and unfiltered report of the information from the reporter. While the report recipient is encouraged to actively query the reporter to elicit the most complete account possible, inferences and imputations should be avoided in report submission. However, clearly identified evaluations by the MAH are considered acceptable and, for some authorities, required.\n* Encouraging good communication on medical information with the reporter will serve to improve the quality of case documentation.\n* When a case is reported by a consumer, his/her description of the event should be retained, although confirmatory or additional information from any relevant healthcare professionals should also be sought and included. Ideally, supplemental information\n* should be obtained from the healthcare professional directly involved in the care of the patient.\n* Follow-up Information\n* The information from ADR cases when first received is generally incomplete. Ideally, comprehensive information would be available on all cases, but in practice efforts\n* should be made to seek additional information on selected reports (see Attachment). In any scheme to optimize the value of follow-up, the first consideration should be prioritization of case reports by importance.\n* The priority for follow-up should be as follows: cases which are 1) both serious and unexpected, 2) serious and expected, and 3) non-serious and unexpected. In addition to seriousness and expectedness as criteria, cases \"of special interest\" also deserve extra attention as a high priority (e.g., ADRs under active surveillance at the request of the * 409 regulators), as well as any cases that might lead to a labeling change decision.\n* 410 Follow-up information should be obtained, via a telephone call and/or site visit and/or\n* 411 via a written request. Efforts should be tailored toward optimising the chances to obtain\n* 412 the new information. Written confirmation of details given verbally should be obtained\n* 413 whenever possible. In exceptional circumstances, a regulatory authority might be able to\n* 414 assist an MAH to obtain follow-up data if requests for information have been refused by\n* 415 the reporter. The company should provide specific questions it would like to have\n* 416 answered.\n* 417\n* 418 In order to facilitate the capture of clinically relevant and complete information, use of a\n* 419 targeted questionnaire is encouraged, preferably at the time of the initial report. Ideally,\n* 420 healthcare professionals with thorough pharmacovigilance training and therapeutic\n* 421 expertise should be involved in the collection and the direct follow up of reported cases\n* 422 (particularly those of medical significance). For serious ADRs, it is important to\n* 423 continue follow-up and report new information until the outcome has been established\n* 424 or the condition is stabilized. How long to follow-up such cases will require judgment.\n* 425\n* 426 MAHs should collaborate on follow-up if more than one MAH's drug is suspected as a\n* 427 causal agent in a case.\n* 428 It is important that, at the time of the original report, sufficient details about the patient\n* 429 and reporter be collected and retained to enable future investigations, within the\n* 430 constraints imposed by local data privacy legislation.\n* 431\n* 432 4.4.1 Follow-up Related to Pregnancy Exposure\n* 433 MAHs are expected to follow up all reports, from healthcare professionals or\n* 434 consumers, of pregnancies where the embryo/foetus could have been exposed to one of its medicinal products. When an active substance, or one of its metabolites, has a long\n* 436 half-life, this should be taken into account when considering whether a foetus could\n* 437 have been exposed (i.e. medicinal products taken before the gestational period need to\n* 438 be considered). If a pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome that the reporter\n* 439 considers might be due to the drug, this should be treated as an expedited report if the\n* 440 criteria for expedited reporting are met.\n* 441\n* 442 4.5 How to Report\n* 443 The CIOMS I (Council of International Organisations for Medical Sciences) form has\n* 444 been a widely accepted standard for expedited adverse event reporting. However, no\n* 445 matter what the form or format used, it is important that certain basic information/data\n* 446 elements, when available, be included with any expedited report, whether in a tabular or\n* 447 narrative presentation. It is recommended that the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory\n* 448 Activities (MedDRA) be used for coding medical information. The standards for\n* 449 electronic submission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR), according to ICH\n* 450 E2B/M2, should be implemented.\n* 451 The listing in the Attachment addresses those data elements regarded as desirable; if all\n* 452 are not available at the time of expedited reporting, efforts should be made to obtain\n* 453 them.\n\n[455] Reference Sources\n\n[456] 1.

There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n\nCan I put only a 2D data matrix barcode on my product as required under the DSCSA in lieu of the linear barcode that is required under SS 201.25, since it also includes the NDC number?\n\nNo. At this time, a 2D data matrix barcode may not be used as a substitution for a linear barcode when one is required under SS 201.25 for packages of product.\n\nCan a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n\nYes. A manufacturer or repackager may voluntarily put the 2D data matrix barcode on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container, if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nExamples of When the Product Identifier Is Required Under the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Is Required Under SS 201.25\n\nFor each of their products, manufacturers and repackagers are responsible for determining the smallest individual saleable unit that they intend for ultimate sale to a dispenser. Under the DSCSA, both a 2D data matrix barcode and the human-readable portion of the product identifier are required to be affixed or imprinted on each such individual saleable unit. While other levels of product packaging may exist that do not require a 2D data matrix barcode, as noted in Question and Answer #19, manufacturers and repackagers may voluntarily affix or imprint a 2D data matrix barcode if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nThe following table provides examples of different units of a package or case and what barcode would be required under the DSCSA and under SS 201.25. It is not an exhaustive list because the information required will depend on the specific details of particular product packaging.\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.138907432556152", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product's standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a \"2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for packages and in a \"linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using \"human-readable or machine-readable methods.\"11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled \"Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,\" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency's thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically.

The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered \u201cradioactive drugs\u201d or \u201cradioactive biological products\u201d, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: \u00a7 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA's draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for \"products,\" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. \"Prescription drugs\" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of \"labeling\" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant's annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., \"lot number\" and \"expiration date\") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.7124176025390625", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.163464903831482", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not address how to link a repackager SNI to a manufacturer SNI, nor does it address standards for prescription drug SNI at levels other than the package-level including, for example, the case- and pallet-levels. Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, \"Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA\u2019s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.4090205430984497", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 18: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.

For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA\u2019s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA's view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, \u201cSubmission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,\u201d on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA's initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated \"May Proceed\" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA's timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA's website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2014 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019). For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIX Other Requirements applicable to an MMA product\n\nAn MMA product is subject to all relevant requirements of applicable statutes, including those implemented by FDA such as the FD&C Act and the PHS Act; applicable implementing regulations under those authorities; and other relevant statutes, including the Social Security Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and the Controlled Substances Act. The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: \"Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry\" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

The categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure are described in the Federal Register notice on expedited review, found at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm118099.htm. As stated in a Federal Register notice, however, sponsors and investigators may not use the expedited review procedure where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998).\n\n6. Can leftover specimens be used in IVD studies without informed consent?\n\nThe document entitled, \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm078384.htm, describes the limited circumstances in which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding requirements for informed consent. (See Glossary for definition of \"leftover specimens\".)\n\n7. Can those who routinely conduct studies with IVDs (e.g., research hospitals) use a general informed consent to address future studies using samples collected in their own facility?\n\nTo fulfill FDA informed consent requirements for studies of IVDs, a site may develop an informed consent process to address the use of samples collected at the facility (see the Glossary for definition) in a specific study or for a broader category of future studies. This general informed consent process may be used for subjects seen at and/or admitted to a specific facility. The informed consent document must contain all of the required elements found in 21 CFR 50.25.\n\n8. Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process?\n\nIf the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm078384.htm.\n\nVI. Data Considerations\n\n1. What information should the protocol include to ensure that the investigational IVD study will be scientifically sound?\n\nWe recommend that the protocol include a clear description of study design; objectives, estimation of performance goals (e.g., desired confidence interval widths) that are directly related to the intended claims for the IVD device, or hypotheses; and a statistical plan to be applied to the data. (See the Glossary for definitions of protocol, statistical hypothesis, and confidence interval.)\n\n2. Is it acceptable to develop new or to revise existing study hypotheses as the study progresses?\n\nWe generally believe it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions from after-the-fact hypotheses. We recommend that changes in study protocols be carefully documented and explained. FDA encourages sponsors to contact the appropriate review division to discuss studies before they are initiated and to consult FDA before changes in protocols are made mid-study. (For the FDA divisions responsible for review of IVD products, see Introduction, Section II, of this guidance.)\n\n3. How should I determine appropriate sample size for a study?\n\nThe sponsor should formulate sample size based on standard statistical techniques and the sample size should account for any unique issues related to intended use(s), device technologies, and/or the biology of the condition being studied.\n\nWhat guidance is available for sponsors to determine how to estimate IVD performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, how to handle discrepant results, and what to do when a study is performed without a truth standard (\"gold standard\") (see the Glossary for definitions)?\n\nFDA has recognized a number of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [(CLSI), formerly National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)] standards related to these issues. A list of these standards, but not the standards themselves, can be found through the database on the CDRH web page http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scrlpts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards\n\nThe agency's guidance entitled \"Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests\" can be viewed at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm071148.htm\n\nHow much leeway is there in deciding on the populations from which human specimens are collected and under what conditions are data on simulated specimens (see the Glossary for definition) acceptable?\n\nStudies should be performed in a representative sample of the intended use population (i.e., representation of both diseased and non-diseased cases, and controlling for subject demographics and morbidity factors that may affect the level of device performance). When a disease is rare or samples are needed specifically to challenge cut-off points, sponsors may use enriched samples, panels of credentialed samples (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panels), and/or spiked or contrived samples. The acceptance of simulated specimens depends on how well they represent specimens from the intended-use population and whether their performance accurately reflects what the IVD device user can expect.\n\nIs it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including \"outliers\". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 8.622868537902832", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: The requirement in section 505(i) of the FD&C Act for informed consent for investigational use of drugs (including biologics) provided that FDA regulations must ensure informed consent is obtained \"except where it is not feasible or it is contrary to the best interest of such human beings.\" In order to promote consistency across medical products, FDA adopted regulations reflecting the device standard for all medical product research.\n\nIn general, FDA's regulations governing the protection of human subjects conform to the requirements in the \"Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects\" (the Common Rule), with a few exceptions because of differences in FDA's mission or statutory authority. The Common Rule, originally promulgated in 19913, sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (see 45 CFR 46, Subpart A) and 15 other Federal departments and agencies. The purpose of the Common Rule is to promote uniformity, understanding, and compliance with human subject protections as well as to create a uniform body of regulations across the Federal departments and agencies.4 FDA regulations and the Common Rule share the same definition for \"minimal risk,\" but the Common Rule allows a waiver of informed consent for minimal risk research if specific criteria are met. As stated above, FDA's regulations currently do not include an exception from informed consent for minimal risk clinical investigations.5\n\nFootnote 4: 80 FR 53931 at 53935, September 8, 2015.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that this exception from the requirement to obtain informed consent differs from the waiver from the requirement for documentation of informed consent permitted under both the Common Rule and FDA regulations (45 CFR 46.117(c); 21 CFR 56.109(c)).\n\nIII Discussion\n\nThe Common Rule standard has been adopted and successfully employed for decades by numerous other Federal agencies. The Common Rule permits an IRB to waive the requirements to obtain informed consent, or to allow changes to, or omission of, some or all elements of informed consent if the IRB finds and documents that: (1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; (2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; (3) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and (4) whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. (45 CFR 46.116(d)).6\n\nFootnote 6: The final rule that recently revised the Common Rule (82 FR 7149, January 19, 2017) adds a fifth criterion (i.e., \u201cif the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format\u201d (new 2018 requirement at 45 CFR 46.116(f)(3)(iii)). As FDA revises its regulations to harmonize to the extent appropriate and permissible with the Common Rule, we will consider including this new criterion in any waiver provision.\n\nThe Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) provided input on the issue of whether waiver of informed consent provisions for certain minimal risk clinical investigations would be appropriate and helpful to FDA-regulated research. On March 13, 2014, SACHRP considered this issue. Recognizing that harmonization with the Common Rule would promote consistency and help to reduce confusion in the research community about when a waiver of informed consent may be permitted, while also facilitating certain FDA-regulated research, SACHRP recommended to the Secretary of HHS that FDA adopt the provisions for waiver of informed consent that exist under the Common Rule at 45 CRF 46.116(d). On October 26, 2016, SACHRP reiterated that recommendation to the Secretary.7_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nIV IRB waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent\n\nWaiver of informed consent for certain FDA-regulated minimal risk clinical investigations will facilitate investigators' ability to conduct studies that may contribute substantially to the development of products to diagnose or treat diseases or conditions, or address unmet medical needs. In light of the Cures Act amendment to the FD&C Act described above, FDA intends to revise its informed consent regulations to add this waiver or alteration under appropriate human subject protection safeguards to the two existing exceptions from informed consent (i.e., in life-threatening situations and for emergency research). However, until FDA promulgates these regulations, we do not intend to object to an IRB8 approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent when the IRB finds and documents9 that:\n\nFootnote 8: An institutional review board (IRB) is defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and is subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56.\n\nFootnote 9: An IRB is required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of its activities, including actions taken by the IRB, under 21 CFR 56.115.\n\nThe clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk (as defined in 21 CFR 50.3(k) or 56.102(i)) to the subjects;\n\nThe waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;\n\nThe clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and\n\nWhenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.\n\nFDA does not intend to object to a sponsor initiating, or an investigator conducting, a minimal risk clinical investigation for which an IRB waives or alters the informed consent requirements as described above. FDA intends to withdraw this guidance after we promulgate regulations to permit a waiver or alteration of informed consent under appropriate human subject protection safeguards consistent with section 3024 of the Cures Act.\n\nV Inquiries about Specific Clinical Investigations\n\nSponsors, investigators and IRBs may contact FDA for questions about implementing the recommendations in this guidance for a specific clinical investigation.

This document is intended to provide guidance. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS, or Department), including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or the public. An alternat approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes a regulations.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA. PurposeIn this guidance document, HHS raises points to consider in determining whether specific financial interests in research affect the rights and welfare of human subjects1 and if so, what actions could be considered to protect those subjects. This guidance applies to human subjects research conducted or supported by HHS or regulated by the FDA. The consideration of financial relationships, as discussed in this document relates to human subject protection in research conducted under the HHS or FDA regulations (45 CFR part 46, 21 CFR parts 50, 56)2 This document is nonbinding and does not change any existing regulations or requirements, and does not impose any new requirements. Institutions and individuals involved in human subjects research may establish financial relationships related to or separate from particular research projects. Those financial relationships may create financial interests of monetary value, such as payments for services, equity interests, or intellectual property rights. A financial interest related to a research study may be a conflicting financial interest. The Department recognizes that some conflicting financial interests in research may affect the rights and welfare of human subjects. This document provides some possible approaches to consider in assuring that human subjects are adequately protected. Institutional review boards (IRBs), institutions, and investigators engaged in human subjects research each have appropriate roles in ensuring that financial interests do not compromise the protection of research subjects.3\n\nTarget Audiences\n\nThe principal target audiences include investigators, IRB members and staffs, institutions engaged in human subjects research and their officials, and other interested members of the research community.\n\nUnderlying Principles\n\nThe regulations protecting human research subjects are based on the ethical principles described in the Belmont report:4 respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The Belmont principles should not be compromised by financial relationships. Openness and honesty are indicators of respect for persons, characteristics that promote ethical research and can only strengthen the research process.\nThe HHS human subject protection regulations (45 CFR part 46) require that institutions performing HHS conducted or supported non-exempt research involving human subjects have the research reviewed and approved by an IRB whose goal is to help ensure that the rights and welfare of human subjects are protected. The comparable FDA regulations (21 CFR parts 50 and 56) require that FDA regulated research involving human subjects is reviewed and approved by such an IRB. Under these regulations, IRBs are responsible for, among other things, determining that:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized (45 CFR 46.111(a)(1), 21 CFR 56.111(a)(1));\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects (45 CFR 46.111(a)(2), 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2));\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable (45 CFR 46.111(a)(3), 21 CFR 56.111(a)(3));\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject (45 CFR 46.111(a) (4), 21 CFR 56.111(a)(4)); and,\n\nThe possibility of coercion or undue influence is minimized (45 CFR 46.116, 21 CFR 50.20).\n\nIn addition the IRB may\n\nRequire that additional information be given to subjects \"when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to protection of the rights and welfare of subjects\" (45 CFR 46.109(b), 21 CFR 56.109(b)).\n\nFor HHS conducted or supported research, the funding agency may impose additional conditions as necessary for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR 46.124).\n\nIRBs are also responsible for ensuring that members who review research have no conflicting interest. 45 CFR 46.107(e) directly addresses conflicts of interest by requiring that \"no IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.\" FDA regulations include identical language at 21 CFR 56.107(e).\n\nConcerns have grown that financial conflicts of interest in research, derived from financial relationships and the financial interests they create, may affect the rights and welfare of human subjects in research. Financial interests are not prohibited, and not all financial interests cause conflicts of interest or affect the rights and welfare of human subjects. HHS recognizes the complexity of the relationships between government, academia, industry and others, and recognizes that these relationshipsoften legitimately include financial relationships. However, to the extent financial interests may affect the rights and welfare of human subjects in research, IRBs, institutions, and investigators need to consider what actions regarding financial interests may be necessary to protect those subjects.\n\nIn May 2000, HHS announced five initiatives to strengthen human subject protection in clinical research. One of these was to develop guidance on financial conflict of interest that would serve to further protect research participants. As part of this initiative, HHS held a conference on the topic of human subject protection and financial conflict of interest on August 15-16, 2000. A draft interim guidance document, \"Financial Relationships in Clinical Research: Issues for Institutions, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs to Consider when Dealing with Issues of Financial Interests and Human Subject Protection,\" based on information obtained at and subsequent to that conference was made available to the public for comment on January 10, 2001.5 This document replaces that draft interim guidance. The Department notes that other organizations have also addressed financial interests in human research via reports, guidance and recommendations.6 Many of these contain strong and sound ideas for actions to deal with potential financial conflicts of interest on the part of institutions, investigators and IRBs.\n\nII. Guidance for Institutions, IRBs and Investigators\n\nA. General Approaches to Address Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects\n\nThe Department recommends that in particular, IRBs, institutions, and investigators consider whether specific financial relationships create financial interests in research studies that may adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects. These entities may find it useful to include the following questions in their deliberations:\n\nWhat financial relationships and resulting financial interests could cause potential or actual conflicts of interest?\n\nAt what levels should those potential or actual financial conflicts of interest be managed or eliminated?* What procedures would be helpful, including those to\n\ncollect and evaluate information regarding financial relationships related to research,\n\ndetermine whether those relationships potentially cause a conflict of interest, and\n\ndetermine what actions are necessary to protect human subjects and ensure that those actions are taken?\n\nWho should be educated regarding financial conflict of interest issues and policies?\n\nWhat entity or entities would examine individual and/or institutional financial relationships and interests?\n\nPoints for Consideration\n\nFinancial interests determined to create a conflict of interest may be managed by eliminating them or mitigating their impact. A variety of methods or combinations of methods may be effective. Some methods may be implemented by institutions engaged in the conduct of research, and some methods may be implemented by IRBs or investigators. Some of those may apply before research begins, and some may apply during the conduct of the research.\n\nIn establishing and implementing methods to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects from conflicts of interest created by financial relationships of parties involved in research, the Department recommends that IRBs, institutions engaged in research, and investigators consider the questions below. Additional questions may be appropriate. The Department's intent is not to be exhaustive, but to suggest ways to examine the issues so that appropriate actions can be taken to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects. The Department recognizes that a number of institutions currently address such issues in their consideration of financial interests of parties involved in human subject research.\n\nDoes the research involve financial relationships that could create potential or actual conflicts of interest?\n\nHow is the research supported or financed?\n\nWhere and by whom was the study designed?\n\nWhere and by whom will the resulting data be analyzed?\n\nWhat interests are created by the financial relationships involved in the situation?\n\nDo individuals or institutions receive any compensation that may be affected by the study outcome?\n\nDo individuals or institutions involved in the research:\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Conflict of Interest- HHS Guidance (2004) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.831100583076477", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA regulations governing IRBs identify children as subjects who may be vulnerable and subject to coercion. In such cases, IRBs must determine that additional safeguards are in place to protect their rights and welfare (21 CFR 56.111(b)). FDA's guidance document entitled, Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/default.htm addresses issues regarding informed consent and the assent of children. The basic requirements of 21 CFR 50.20 regarding informed consent apply to the pediatric population. See also the guidance entitled, E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population, http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm129477.pdf. We recommend that you consult 21 CFR Part 50 - Subpart D Additional Safeguards forChildren in Clinical Investigations (discussed below) and other referenced resources dealing with informed consent, assent, permission, financial remuneration, direct benefit, and minimal risk.\n\nAppendix A Relevant Definitions\n\nThe following terms are defined in FDA's and the Department of Health and Human Services' human subject protection regulations and guidance:\n\nAssent means a child's affirmative agreement to participate in a clinical investigation. Mere failure to object may not be construed as assent. 21 CFR 50.3(n).\n\nChildren means persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted. 21 CFR 50.3(o).\n\nEmanciated Minor: A legal status conferred upon persons who have not yet attained the age of legal competency as defined by state law, but who are entitled to treatment as if they had by virtue of assuming adult responsibilities, such as self-support, marriage, or procreation.8\n\nFamily member means any one of the following legally competent persons: Spouse; parents; children (including adopted children); brothers, sisters, and spouses of brothers and sisters; and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the subject is the equivalent of a family relationship. 21 CFR 50.3(m).\n\nFootnote 8: IRB Guidebook: Chapter VI Special Classes of Subjects,\n\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/irb/irb_chapter6.htm.\n\nGuardian means an individual who is authorized under applicable state or local law to consent on behalf of a child to general medical care when general medical care includes participation in research. For purposes of subpart D of 21 CFR Part 50, a guardian also means an individual who is authorized to consent on behalf of a child to participate in research. 21 CFR 50.3(s).\n\nLegally authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research. 21 CFR 50.3(l).\n\nMature Minor: Persons who have not reached adulthood (as defined by state law) but who may be treated as an adult for certain purposes (e.g., consenting to medical care). Note that a mature minor is not necessarily an emancipated minor. 11Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. 21 CFR 50.3(k).\n\nParent means a child's biological or adoptive parent. 21 CFR 50.3(p).\n\nPermission means the agreement of parent(s) or guardian to the participation of their child or ward in a clinical investigation. Permission must be obtained in compliance with subpart B of 21 CFR Part 50 and must include the elements of informed consent described in SS50.25. 21 CFR 50.3(r).\n\nAppendix B Study Design Considerations\n\nAs discussed above, FDA recommends that sponsors identify the subgroup(s) in which to evaluate the device, unless the device is intended for the entire pediatric population. When deciding whether a clinical trial is needed for a particular pediatric population, the following points are important to consider:\n\nDoes the research have an identifiable prospect of direct benefit to the individual child participant? Can that benefit be achieved through alternative means?\n\nDoes the research have an identifiable prospect of risk to the individual child participant? What safeguards are proposed to minimize these risks? When procedures involving greater than minimal risk to children are anticipated, are convincing scientific and ethical justifications given?\n\nIt is important when designing the study that every attempt is made to anticipate and reduce possible study hazards. Investigators should be knowledgeable of all relevant pre- clinical data and be properly trained and experienced in the pediatric population and medical procedures used for this population.\n\nWe recommend that you ensure appropriate pediatric expertise is reasonably available during the entire trial. We also recommend all clinical sites have staff and equipment appropriate for pediatric care. Your clinical sites should also have pediatric-specific emergency measures, such as properly sized oxygen, suction, and resuscitation devices as well as medications to treat severe anaphylaxis and adverse reactions.\n\nBecause many procedures used during clinical trials are often new to the child, every effort should be made to ensure the participants' experiences in the study are positive and to minimize discomfort and distress. Additionally, before studies are undertaken, an evaluation should be made to determine if the needed information can be obtained from less vulnerable populations. When studies are conducted in the pediatric population, every attempt should be made to include individuals representing the demographics of the region and the disease being studied. Studies in handicapped or institutionalized pediatric subjects should be limited to diseases or conditions found principally in these populations.\n\nTo be of benefit to those participating in a clinical study, the study should be properly designed and conducted to ensure that quality data are obtained. Following Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is crucial to obtaining quality and reliable data from the study.\n\nAppendix C The Role of the Institutional Review Board (IRB)\n\nThe principal role of the IRB is to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects; this is especially true when studies involve children as subjects. To safeguard the child's interests and to protect children from harm, special ethical and regulatory considerations are in place for reviewing research involving children. The regulations at 21 CFR Part 50 Subpart D Additional Protections for Children Involved as Subjects of Research describe these considerations.\n\nIRBs reviewing research involving children as subjects should consider the benefits, risks and discomorts inherent in the proposed research and assess their justification in light of the expected benefits to the child subject or to society as a whole. The IRB should weigh the circumstance of the subject under study, the magnitude of risks that may accrue for the research procedures, and the potential benefits the research may provide to the subjects.\n\nThe regulations require IRBs to classify research involving children into one of four categories and to document their discussions of the risks and benefits of the research study. The four categories are:\n\nClinical investigations not involving greater than minimal risk (21 CFR 50.51)\n\nClinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects. (21 CFR 50.52)\n\nClinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition. (21 CFR 50.53)\n\nClinical investigations not otherwise approvable that present an opportunity to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children. (21 CFR 50.54)\n\nIn all cases, IRBs must determine that adequate provisions have been made for soliciting the assent of children and the permission of their parents or guardians. (21 CFR 50.55)\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n4.4.1 Consent and Assent\n\nWe recommend that you ensure that the informed consent document is clearly written and that the risks and benefits are thoroughly explained. FDA recognizes that consent depends on a number of factors, including:\n\nage\n\nmaturity level\n\nlegal status of the subject (emancipated or mature minor)\n\napplicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted and which\n\nin turn determines legal age of consent\n\ncomprehension level of the pediatric research participant, parents, guardians,\n\nand legally authorized representative.\n\nWe also recommend that you consider:\n\nprognosis and life expectancy of patients with certain diseases or disorders\n\nmental capacity, intellectual quotient, and level of functioning\n\ndiffering ages and maturity level\n\ndirect benefits and risks of the pediatric participant's research involvement\n\n(research versus therapeutic treatment)\n\nethical issues\n\nproper monitoring (data and safety monitoring).\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.326364278793335", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: Determining whether other actions are necessary to minimize risks to subjects.\n\nDetermining the kind, amount, and level of detail of information to be provided to research subjects regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, financial interests of parties involved in the research, and any financial interest management techniques applied.\n\nInvestigators The Department recommends that investigators conducting human subjects research consider the potential effects that a financial relationship of any kind might have on the research or on interactions with research subjects, and what actions to take.\n\nActions to consider:\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent document, such as\n\nthe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of research, or\n\ninformation about a financial arrangement of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as\n\nhaving a another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the research.\n\nDated: /May 5, 2004/\n\n/Signed/\n\nTommy G. Thompson\n\nSecretary\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n\n1 Under the Public Health Service Act and other applicable law, HHS has authority to regulate institutions engaged in HHS conducted or supported research involving human subjects. For a description of what is meant by institutions engaged in research see the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) engagement policy . Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA has the authority to regulate Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and investigators involved in the review or conduct of FDA-regulated research.\n\n2 This document does not address HHS Public Health Service regulatory requirements that cover institutional management of the financial interests of individual investigators who conduct Public Health Service (PHS) supported research (42 CFR part 50, subpart F, and 45 CFR part 94). This document also does not address FDA regulatory requirements that place responsibilities on sponsors to disclose certain financial interests of investigators to FDA in marketing applications (21 CFR part 54). Guidelines interpreting the application of the PHS regulations to research conducted or supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that involve human subjects are available at http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm. Guidance interpreting the provisions of the FDA regulations appears at http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm. The PHS regulations require grantee institutions and contractors to designate one or more persons to review investigators' financial disclosure statement describing their significant financial interests and ensure that conflicting financial interests are managed, reduced, or eliminated before expenditure of funds (42 CFR 50.604(b), 45 CFR 94.4(b)). The PHS threshold for significant financial interest is $10,000 per year income or equity interests over $10,000 and 5 percent ownership in a company (42 CFR 50.603, 45 CFR 94.3). The regulations give several examples of methods for managing investigators' financial conflicts of interest (42 CFR 50.605(a), 54 CFR 94.5(a)). Sponsors are required to disclose certain financial interests of clinical investigators to FDA in marketing approval applications under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 CFR part 54). FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 54 address requirements for the disclosure of certain financial interests held by clinical investigators. The purpose of these regulations is to provide additional information to allow FDA to assess the reliability of the clinical data (21 CFR 54.1). The FDA regulations require sponsors seeking marketing approval for products to certify that investigatorsdo not have certain financial interests, or to disclose those interests to FDA (21 CFR 54.4). These regulations require sponsors to report (1) financial arrangements between the sponsor and the investigator whereby the value of the investigator's compensation could be influenced by the outcome of the trial, (2) any proprietary interest in the product studied held by the investigator; (3) significant payments of other sorts over $25,000 beyond costs of the study; or (4) any significant equity interest in the sponsor of a covered study (21 CFR 54.4).\n\nNote that when the PHS regulations were promulgated, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy was revised to match closely the PHS regulations. The NSF conflict of interest policy appears\n\nat http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-07-11/html/95-16800.htm\n\nhttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/fr-1995-07-11/html/95-16800.htm.\n\n3 The Department recognizes that some non-financial conflicting interests related to research also may affect the rights and welfare of human subjects. However, non-financial interests are beyond the scope of this guidance document.\n\nBelmont Report\n\n5 Financial Relationships in Clinical Research https://wayback.archive-it.org/4657/20150930183026/http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/humansubjects/finreltn/finmain.htm .\n\n6 Recent Federal and Private Sector Activities: In addition to the HHS initiative, several Federal organizations have examined the issues related to financial relationships in human subjects research:\n\n({}^{\\star}) The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC), in a comprehensive examination of the \"Ethical and Policy Issues in Research Involving Human Participants,\" in Chapter 3 recommended development of federal, institutional, and sponsor policies and guidance to ensure that research subjects' rights and welfare are protected from the effects of conflicts of interest\n\n(http://www.georgetown.edu/research/nrcb/nbc/human/overvol1.pdf).\n\n({}^{\\star}) The HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has issued a series of reports examining regulation and activities of IRBs. A June 2000 OIG report addressed recruitment practices and found that about onequarter of the surveyed IRBs consider financial arrangements with sponsors of research as part of their protocol review\n\n(http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-97-00195.pdf).\n\n({}^{\\star}) The National Human Research Protections Advisory Committee (NHRPAC) offered advice to HHS regarding the content and finalization of the HHS Draft Interim Guidance in August, 2001 (http://ohrp.osophs.dhhs.gov/hhrpac/documents/aug01a.pdf).\n\n({}^{\\star}) In December 2001, the General Accounting Office released report 02-89 \"Biomedical Research: HHS Direction Needed to Address Financial Conflicts of Interest.\" The report recommended that the Secretary of Health and Human Services develop specific guidance or regulations concerning institutional financial conflicts of interest (http://www.gao.gov/).\n\n({}^{\\star}) A number of nongovernmental organizations recently have addressed financial interests in reports and issued new or updated policies or guidelines of varying scope and specificity, including the Association of American Universities, October 2001 (http://www.aau.edu/research/COI.01.pdf), the Association of American Medical Colleges, December 2001 and October 2002 (http://www.aamc.org/members/coitf/firstreport.pdf and http://www.aamc.org/members/coitf/2002coireport.pdf), the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors October 2001 (http://www.icmje.org/sponsor.htm), the American Medical Association, January 2002 (http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/287/1/78), and opinions E-8.0315 Managing Conflicts of Interest in the Conduct of Clinical Trials (http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/8471.html) and E- 8031 Conflicts of Interest: Biomedical Research (http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/8470.html), the American Society of Gene Therapy, April 2000 (http://www.asgt.org/policy/index.html), the American Society of Clinical Oncology, June 2003 (http://www.jco.org/cgi/content/full/21/12/2394), and the Institute of Medicine, October 2002,report \"Responsible Research: A Systems Approach to Protecting Research Participants\" (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309084881/html/).\n\n({}^{\\star}) Two accrediting bodies for human subject protection programs have included elements addressing individual and institutional conflicts of interest in their accreditation evaluations, the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (http://www.aahrpp.org/images/Evaluation_Instrument_1.pdf) and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, (http://www.ncqa.org/Programs/QSG/VAHRP/vahrppapfindstds.pdf).\n\nInternationally, the World Medical Association's revision in 2000 of the Declaration of Helsinki, (http://www.wma.net/e/policy/17-c_e.html) principle 22, includes \"sources of funding\" among the items of information to be provided to subjects. A number of individual institutions also have developed policies for their own situations, as noted in the NIH Guide Notice issued in June 2000 (http://grants.nih.grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-040.html). Some of these policies involve conflicts of interest management methods and address institutional financial interests as well as individual interests.\n\n7 The acronym COIC will be used to represent the body or person(s) designated to review financial interests.\n\nContent created by Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)\n\nContent last reviewed March 29, 2016\n\nSign Up for Email Updates\n\nReceive the latest updates from the Secretary, Blogs, and News Releases.\n\nSign Up https://cloud.connect.hhs.gov/subscriptioncenter\n\nHHS Headquarters\n\n200 Independence Avenue, S.W.\n\nWashington, D.C. 20201\n\nToll Free Call Center: 1-877-696-6775\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Conflict of Interest- HHS Guidance (2004) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6343556642532349", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA needs to hear about all important effects of the investigational product, so that the agency can (1) ensure that the results of the investigation are not biased, and (2) make a determination as to the product's safety and effectiveness.\n\nCan information about a subject's death be collected even if the subject has discontinued participation in the study?\n\nYes. Although a subject may have discontinued participation in a study, data about a subject's death is contained in public vital statistics records. Access to public records is not subject to restriction under 21 CFR 50.24 or other FDA regulations.\n\n114. Do FDA's regulations require that informed consent be obtained from a deceased subject's family members before public records can be accessed?\n\nNo. Access to public records is not subject to restriction under 21 CFR 50.24 or other FDA regulations. The information included in death records may be accessed and collected without triggering FDA's informed consent requirements.\n\nUnder FDA's regulations, \"human subject\" means \"an individual who is or becomes a participant in research, either as a recipient of the test article or as a control. A subject may be either a healthy human or a patient.\" (See 21 CFR 50.3(g); similar language is found at 21 CFR 312.3 and 812.3(p).) FDA has interpreted its regulations as applicable only to research involving living human subjects. Since the individuals referenced are deceased, such review does not meet FDA's definition of research involving human subjects. FDA has also concluded that a limited look at public death records would, in any event, be encompassed by the exception from informed consent for emergency research.52\n\nFootnote 52: See Preamble to the October 2, 1996 Final Rule, Comment #94, 61 Fed. Reg. 51519.\n\nPublic access to autopsy records would be determined by applicable State or local laws and regulations.\n\n115. For emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, involving an exception from informed consent, may an IRB or Privacy Board waive the authorization requirement that would otherwise apply under 45 CFR 164.508 of the HIPAA Privacy Rule?\n\nYes. Under the Privacy Rule issued to implement the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), an individual must generally sign a permission, known as an Authorization, before a covered entity may use or disclose the individual's protected health information (PHI) for research purposes, unless the covered entity receives documentation that an IRB or Privacy Board has waived or altered the Authorization requirement. 45 CFR 164.512(i). In the context of emergency research involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24, there may well be considerations present, such as the inability of the subjects to provide Authorization as a result of their medical condition, that could support an IRB or Privacy Board decision to waive the HIPAA Privacy Rule's Authorization requirement.\n\nThe Privacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.512(i) contains criteria for waiver or alteration of the Authorization requirement by an IRB or Privacy Board. In particular, the documentation of waiver approval obtained by the covered entity must, among other things, include a statement that the IRB or Privacy Board has determined that the alteration or waiver, in whole or in part, of Authorization satisfies the following criteria:\n\nThe PHI use or disclosure involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals based on at least the presence of (1) an adequate plan to protect PHI identifiers from improper use and disclosure; (2) an adequate plan to destroy those identifiers at the earliest opportunity, consistent with the research, absent a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or if retention is otherwise required by law; and (3) adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity except (a) as required by law, (b) for authorized oversight of the research study, or (c) for other research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI is permitted by the Privacy Rule.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without the requested waiver or alteration.\n\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.\n\nThus, to the extent an IRB or Privacy Board has determined that the circumstances of the emergency research subject to an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24 satisfy the HIPAA Privacy Rule's waiver criteria, and has documented the waiver approval in accordance with 45 CFR 164.512(i)(2), a covered entity may use or disclose PHI for the research based on such documentation.\n\nXI Data Monitoring Committee (Dmc)\n\nBefore a study may be initiated, the IRB must find and document that an independent DMC has been established to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iv)).\n\nFDA interprets this regulatory provision to permit a sponsor to either establish an independent DMC or to secure the services of an already established DMC to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation. FDA is making this clarification to provide flexibility to sponsors in meeting the regulatory requirements.\n\nFor more information on the roles, responsibilities and operating procedures of Data Monitoring Committees, please see FDA's Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors, Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees, March 2006.53 The DMC guidance represents FDA's current thinking on DMCs and their operations.\n\nFootnote 53: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126578.pdf\n\nXII For Further Information\n\nA Contacts\n\nSponsors, clinical investigators, and IRBs with questions regarding policy or applications pertaining to an exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24 may contact the appropriate office(s) identified on FDA's website:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\nB FDA's Websites\n\nGood Clinical Practice:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/default.htm\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/default.htm\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/default.htm\n\n21 CFR 50.24\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nThe text of 21 CFR 50.24 appears below:\n\nSubpart B-Informed Consent of Human Subjects Sec. 50.24, Exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research.\n\n(a) The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the clinical investigation described in this section may approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of all research subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a licensed physician who is a member of or consultant to the IRB and who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation) finds and documents each of the following:\n\n(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.\n\n(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because:\n\n(i) The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;\n\n(ii) The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized representatives is feasible; and\n\n(iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.\n\n(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because:\n\n(i) Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;\n\n(ii) Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and\n\n(iii) Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.\n\n(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact legally authorized representatives and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\n(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document consistent with 50.25. These procedures and the informed consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.962913155555725"], "After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.5527578592300415", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: On May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule titled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (81 FR 33742) (\"final rule\"). In the final rule, we stated that we needed additional time to fully consider the information provided in the citizen petition and the comments we received to the proposed rule (81 FR 33742 at 33796). Therefore, we did not reach a decision as to whether allulose should be excluded from the declaration of \"Total Carbohydrate,\" \"Total Sugars,\" and/or \"Added Sugars.\" We stated that allulose, as a monosaccharide, must be included in the amount of the declaration of \"Total Carbohydrate,\" \"Total Sugars,\" and \"Added Sugars\" pending any future rulemaking that would otherwise consider excluding allulose from the declaration.\n\nAfter we issued the final rule, we received two citizen petitions regarding allulose. One citizen petition, submitted by the Food Lawyers (Docket Number FDA-2016-P-2030) (Ref. 3), requested, among other things, that we amend 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i) by adding the following:\n\n\"(G) Using the following general factor for caloric value of Allulose (also known as D-Allulose, D-psicose): Allulose -- 0.4 calories per gram.\"\n\nThe citizen petition included information to support the caloric value of 0.4 kcal/g for allulose.\n\nAnother citizen petition, submitted by Tate & Lyle (Docket Number FDA-2017-P-1463) (Ref. 4), requested, among other things, that we amend 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i) to include the following in a new section (G):\n\n\"(G) Using the following general factor for caloric value of Allulose (also known as, D-allulose, D-psicose): Allulose - 0.2 calories per gram.\"\n\nThe petition included information to support the caloric value of 0.2 kcal/g for allulose.\n\nIn a comment to the Tate & Lyle citizen petition, the Food Lawyers stated that they fully supported a caloric value for allulose of 0.2 kcal/g.\n\nOn August 13, 2018, Tate & Lyle submitted the results from a clinical trial that assessed the impact of allulose on dental plaque pH. On August 22, 2018, Matsutani Chemical Industry Co. LTD submitted the results of a clinical trial that assessed the impact of allulose consumption on dental plaque pH as well as a copy of U.S. Patent No. 8,496,915, including an in vitro study that examined the final medium pH and the growth of a bacterial strain that causes dental caries when cultured with allulose.5 We considered these studies in our review of the scientific evidence related to the cariogenic potential of allulose (Ref. 8).\n\nFootnote 5: Both the Tate & Lyle and Matsutani Chemical Industry submissions were in support of the 2015 Tate & Lyle citizen petition. The submissions can be found in docket FDA-2015-P-1201.\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 18, 2019 (84 FR 16272), we announced the availability of a draft guidance titled \"The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Guidance for Industry,\" in which we announced our tentative views on the declaration of allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels and caloric content of allulose. The draft guidance also advised manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the exclusion of allulose from the amount of \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" declared on the label, and for use of a general factor of 0.4 kcal/g for allulose when determining \"Calories\" on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels pending review of the issues in a rulemaking. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are reflected in this final guidance. We also conducted an independent review of the scientific evidence on the cariogenic potential, metabolism, and caloric value of, and glycemic response to, allulose (Ref. 8).\n\n3 Declaration of Allulose on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\n\nFDA's Consideration of the Caloric Value of Allulose\n\nWe did not determine a specific caloric value for allulose in the final rule. Therefore, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(B), a caloric value of 4 kcal/g must currently be used for allulose because it is a carbohydrate. The citizen petitions from the Food Lawyers (Ref. 3) and from Tate & Lyle (Ref. 4) identified two human studies on the metabolism of allulose. Our search of the literature did not reveal any additional human studies that determined a caloric value of allulose. We provide a summary of the studies in our memorandum to the file (Ref. 8).\n\nThe two citizen petitions (Refs. 4 and 3) provided data supporting the use of 0.2 kcal/g for allulose and 0.4 kcal/g for allulose.6 Based on our review of the evidence (Ref. 8), we conclude that the caloric contribution of allulose is very low (i.e., no more than 0.4 kcal/g) because the majority of allulose is excreted intact in the urine, and because allulose is poorly fermented in the gut. We have limited evidence from human studies, using different methodologies, upon which to determine the caloric value of allulose. Therefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of a caloric value of 0.4 kcal/g for allulose because, based on the range of data we have, such a caloric value would not underestimate the caloric contribution. We intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a caloric value of 0.4 kcal/g when calculating declarations on Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels pending rulemaking to consider amending 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i) regarding the use of a general factor for the caloric value of allulose.\n\n2 FDA's Consideration of Allulose as a Carbohydrate\n\nTotal Carbohydrate content is determined for the purposes of nutrition labeling by subtraction of the sum of the crude protein, total fat, moisture, and ash from the total weight of the food (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)). The calculation method is described in A.L. Merrill and B.K. Watt, \"Energy Value of Foods-Basis and Derivation\" (Ref. 2). \"Carbohydrate\" as a class captures a variety of substances ranging from mono and disaccharides to numerous types of non-digestible carbohydrates, some of which are dietary fibers. As previously mentioned, allulose is a monosaccharide. It has the chemical composition of a carbohydrate and is captured under the method for determination of Total Carbohydrate in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6).\n\nThe 2015 Tate & Lyle citizen petition (Ref. 1) suggested that allulose should not be included in the Total Carbohydrate definition because, in part, it does not raise blood glucose levels, and thus could be confusing for individuals who are interested in monitoring their blood glucose levels, such as diabetics. We have traditionally based our decision on labeling of carbohydrates on whether a substance is chemically a carbohydrate (79 FR 11880 at 11900). As we explained in the final rule, we had invited comment on and considered:\n\nwhether carbohydrates should be classified and declared in nutrition labeling based on their chemical definition (which is the current method) or on their physiological effect (e.g., attenuation of blood sugar or laxation), and whether additional types of carbohydrates (e.g., starch) should be listed separately on the Nutrition Facts label. We explained that carbohydrates include starch, sugars, sugar alcohols, and dietary fibers and that different carbohydrates have different physiological effects [79 FR 11879 at 11901]. Within the different types of carbohydrate (i.e., starch, sugars, sugar alcohols, and dietary fibers), too, specific carbohydrates may have different physiological effects (e.g., different types of dietary fibers) making it difficult to apply a definition that is based on physiological effects across a category of carbohydrates. Furthermore, analytical methods for measuring different types of carbohydrates are based on chemical structure rather than physiological effect. Given the various components of total carbohydrate and different types of physiological effects of each, we decided not to change our provisions for the classification or declaration of carbohydrates specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6).\n\n33742 at 33795.\n\nIn summary, we considered whether a physiological effect-based definition was appropriate for total carbohydrates and determined that it was not because of the wide variety of effects of different types of carbohydrates.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed in the final rule, the information in the Nutrition Facts label is not targeted to individuals with acute or chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease). The nutrient declaration and percent Daily Values on the label are to help consumers make more informed choices to consume a healthy diet and not intended for the clinical management of an existing disease (81 FR 33742 at 33750). Inclusion of allulose in the declaration of \"Total Carbohydrate\" on Nutrition and Supplement Facts label is also consistent with how we have considered the declaration of other substances that are captured under the method that is currently used for the determination of \"Total Carbohydrate\" on the label, including those that provide few or no calories, such as sugar alcohols and dietary fibers.\n\nTherefore, because allulose is a carbohydrate, it is captured under the calculation method for \"Total Carbohydrate\" described in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6), like a number of other substances without significant caloric contribution. We have determined that our existing definition of carbohydrate is the most appropriate and allulose must be included in the amount of \"Total Carbohydrate\" declared on the label under the existing regulations.\n\n3 FDA's Consideration of Allulose as a Sugar\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.2844395637512207", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nReference Amounts Customarily\n\nConsumed: List of Products for Each\n\nProduct Category:\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling\n\nNutrition Programs Staff HFS-830\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n240-402-1450\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide examples of products that belong in each of the product categories included in the tables of Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed (RACCs) per Eating Occasion established in 21 CFR 101.12(b). This guidance will help industry identify the product category to which specific products belong, but is not meant to provide an all-inclusive list of products that are available on the market for each product category.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) gives us the authority to require nutrition labeling on most packaged foods we regulate. Specifically, section 403(q)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)(1)(A)(i)) requires, with certain exceptions, that food that is intended for human consumption and offered for sale bear nutrition information that provides a serving size that reflects the amount of food customarily consumed and is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the food. Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.12(b), establish RACCs for specified product categories that manufacturers can use to determine the required label serving size. In a final rule published in the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments\" (81 FR 34000: \"2016 final rule\"), we amended 21 CFR 101.12(b) to update or modify certain pre-existing RACCs and to establish RACCs for new product categories.\n\nTo comply with the requirements of section 403(q)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act, food manufacturers should determine the food category into which specific products belong and label the food products with the appropriate label serving size based on the reference amount of the product customarily consumed.2 Food product categories are listed in the RACC tables in 21 CFR 101.12(b). The categories in the RACC tables are generally considered to be broad descriptions of the types of products that are assigned to the applicable RACC. This guidance provides additional examples of products that belong in each of the product categories for which a RACC has been established in 21 CFR 101.12(b). The tables in this guidance are not meant to be an all-inclusive list of products that are available on the market for each product category.3\n\nFootnote 2: Other relevant factors in determining label serving size are set forth in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.12, and 101.36.\n\nFootnote 3: To the extent that you do not believe that a product you market fits under one of the existing product categories in the tables under 21 CFR 101.12(b), we recommend that you contact FDA to discuss an appropriate RACC for your product.\n\nIII Specific Food Product Examples: Tables 1 and 2\n\nThe RACCs established in 21 CFR 101.12(b) are divided into two tables: one for infants and young children 1 through 3 years of age (table 1),4 and another for the general food supply (i.e., individuals four years of age and older) (table 2). Both tables in 21 CFR 101.12(b) provide three columns of information: (1) The name of the product categories; (2) the relevant RACCs as determined by FDA; and (3) appropriate label statements, which are meant to provide examples of serving size statements that may be used on the label. For purposes of this guidance, a fourth column has been added that contains examples of products that fall within each product category.\n\nNOTE: For hard bread sticks, see \u201cCrackers that are usually not used as snack, melba toast, hard bread sticks, ice cream cones\u201d product category.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion and Associated Examples of Products: General Food Supply [12].\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:39]\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed (List of Products for Each Product Category) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.1835198402404785", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nare sold in the United States in a 12-month period.

FDA DOES NOT SEND CONFIRMATION THAT THE AGENCY HAS RECEIVED YOUR COMPLETED NOTICE.\n\nPLEASE KEEP A COPY OF YOUR SUBMITTED NOTICE FOR YOUR RECORDS.\n\nThe Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's (CFSAN's) website provides a sample nutrition labeling exemption notice (/food/labeling-nutrition/small-business-nutrition-labeling-exemption-notice-model-form). You can also visit this website to check for a list of firms that have filed notices for their low-volume products.\n\nWeb-based Submission (https://www.cfsaanappsexternal.fda.gov/scripts/NLE/client/login.cfm).\n\nE-mail your notice to: shusiness@cfsan.fda.gov (mailto:shusines@cfsan.fda.gov)\n\nSend your notice to: Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Food and Drug Administration HFS-82o 5001 Campus Drive College Park, MD 20740-3835 Top 0If you have questions, please call 240-402-1933.\n\nAppendix II - Model Small Business Nutrition Labeling Exemption Notice.\n\nInstructions for Completion\n\nPLEASE TYPE OR PRINT CLEARLY AND FILI OUT COMPLETELY.\n\nName of Firm: Enter the legal name of your firm.\n\nFirm Address: Enter the mailing address for the principal location of your firm. Also, provide the telephone number, FAX number, and e-mail address.\n\nType of Firm: Place a check mark or \"x\" on each line that applies to your firm. For example, if your firm manufactures all products that it sells, place a check mark after \"Manufacturer.\"\n\n12-Month Time Period for which Firm is Claiming an Exemption: Enter the specific time period for which you are requesting an exemption for your products. The time period for which you are claiming an exemption must be current with the date that you are submitting your notice. The exemption notice should apply to the current year.\n\nFor products for which a notice has been filed for the previous year, update the previous dates for the same dates of the upcoming year. For new products, the time period should start with the date on which sales in the United States are expected to begin: e.g., \"FROM\n\n10/01/04 -9/30/05.\"\n\nAverage Number of Full-Time Equivalent Employees for Twelve-Month Period: Enter the average number of full-time equivalent employees for your firm and all of its affiliates for the year preceding the 12-month period for which an exemption is claimed in item 4 (Refer to the sample small business exemption notice). For a new business, enter the number of employees for the upcoming year. The average number should include all employees for your firm and its affiliates, including the owner(s); officers; and all other personnel such as secretarial, production, and distribution. Firms are affiliates of each other when (either directly or indirectly) (1) one firm has the power to control the other, (2) a third party controls or has the power to control both, or (3) an identity of interest exists such that affiliation may be found.\n\nThe average number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by the following formula: Total number of hours of salary or wages paid to the employees of the firm and its affiliates divided by 2080 hours. For example, 254,998 paid hours divided by 2080 = 122. If the total number of actual employees for your firm and its affiliates is less than 100, you may enter the total number of actual employees instead of calculating the average number of full-time employees. For example, if a firm has 24 employees that work full-time, and 12 employees that work part-time, you may report 36 total actual employees instead of calculating the average number of full-time equivalent employees.\n\nReport of Units Sold (Continuation sheets using the same format for item 6 in the sample small business notice may be used if necessary):\n\nProduct:Under the column for product, enter the name, including the brand name, for each product for which your firm is claiming an exemption. A product includes all package sizes that are manufactured by a single manufacturer or which bears the same brand name, which has the same statement of identity, and has a similar preparation method. In considering whether products have similar preparation methods, consider all steps that go into the preparation of the products, from the initial formulation steps to any finishing steps; for example, products with different ingredients would be considered different food products and counted separately in determining the number of units.\n\nNo. of Units: Provide the approximate total number of units of the various package sizes of the product sold in the United States in the 12-month period preceding that for which the nutrition labeling exemption is claimed. For a new product, provide an estimate of the number of units of the product expected to be sold in the United States in the 12-month period for which you are claiming an exemption.\n\nThe approximate total number of units is the sum of the number of units of the various package sizes of the food product in the form in which it is sold to consumer. For example, the total of all 2-pound, 5-pound and 10-pound bags of flour should be provided as the total number of units of flour sold by a firm in the United States.\n\nThere may also be occasions when a food is sold in bulk or by individual pieces rather than in packaging. For example, flour may be sold in bulk displays at grocery stores. In this case, the number of units should be determined on the basis of the typical sales practice for the product. For instance, if 2000 pounds of flour are sold from bulk displays at grocery stores, and the typical practice for sales to consumers is to price the flour on a per bound basis, then the bulk sales would represent 2000 units. If this product is also sold in packaged form, then 2000 units should be added to the total number of units of flour sold by the firm in the United States.\n\nManufacturer: Under the column designated \"Manufacturer,\" enter the letter that corresponds with the name of the manufacturer of the product. The letter \"A\" is used to designate the firm submitting the notice if it is the manufacturer of the product.\n\nName and Address of Manufacturer(s), Distributor(s), or Importer(s) of Products in Item 6 (please refer to the sample small business exemption notice) if Different From Firm Claiming the Exemption: If the firm submitting the notice is not the manufacturer of the product, use the letter from item 7 (please refer to sample small business exemption notice) (B or C or additional letters may be used on a continuation sheet) that corresponds to the name and address of the manufacturer, distributor, or importer of the products for which an exemption is being claimed if they are different than the firm claiming the exemption. If the name of the manufacturer is unknown, provide the name of the firm (\\bigstar) from which the product is purchased. Top 0\n\nContact person: Enter the name of a person that can act as a contact for the firm if any questions arise concerning the information included in the notice.\n\nCertification: The form is to be signed by a responsible individual for the firm that can certify that the information provided in the notice is complete and accurate. The individual signing the notice will commit to notifying the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements when the average number of full-time equivalent employees or total number of units of products sold in the United States by the firm exceed the applicable numbers for the time period for which the exemption is being claimed.\n\nWeb-based Submission\n\n(https://www.cfsanappseexternal.fda.gov/scripts/NLE/client/login.cfm).\n\nHard Copy Model Form (/food/labeling-nutrition/small-business-nutrition-labeling-exemption-notice-model-form).\n\nThis document was issued on October 1, 2004, and updated on May 7, 2007.\n\nSee more recent information on Food Labeling (/labeling-nutrition-o).\n\nRelated Information\n\nLabeling & Nutrition Guidance Documents & Regulatory Information (/food/guidance-documents-regulatory-information-topic-food-and-dietary-supplements/labeling-nutrition-guidance-documents-regulatory-information).\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Petitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Business Nutrition Labeling Exemption Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.515066623687744", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance document\n\nGuidance for Industry: Interim Procedures for Qualified\n\nHealth Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food\n\nand Human Dietary Supplements\n\nJULY 2003\n\nDocket Number:\n\nFDA-2003-N-0103 (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2003-N-0103).\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-interim-procedures:\n\nqualified-health-claims-labeling-conventional-human-food-and)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFor questions regarding this draft document contact the Center for Food Safety and Applied\n\nNutrition (CFSAN) at 240-402-1450.\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

Procedures\n\nFiling Review\n\nPrioritization\n\nOpportunity for Public Comment\n\nScientific Review\n\nConsolidation of Like Petitions\n\nConsultation with Other Federal Agencies\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nA Criteria for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion FDA plans to establish criteria for considering exercising enforcement discretion for qualified health claims based on the extent to which the totality of the publicly available evidence supports the claim (see Guidance for Industry and FDA: Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data). Different levels of evidence will result in different qualifying language as described in Table 1, which provides standardized language for the B, C, and D categories to be used as part of the qualifying language for qualified health claims until consumer research [3] is complete.\n\nProcedures\n\nFiling Review FDA plans to begin accepting petitions for qualified health claims on September 1, 2003. Within 45 days of receipt of a qualified health claim petition, FDA intends to determine whether the petition is complete (see Section C below). If the petition is incomplete, the agency plans to inform the petitioner of the deficiencies and what steps the petitioner should take to rectify these deficiencies. If FDA determines that the petition is complete, it intends to file the petition. The agency recognizes that it can evaluate petitions more efficiently and effectively if they are well-organized and contain all the relevant information. FDA encourages potential petitioners to meet with the agency prior to preparing a petition to discuss their plans.\n\nPrioritization\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline\nScientific Ranking & FDA & \\\nRanking & Category & Appropriate Qualifying Language*** \\ \\hline Second Level & B &... \u201calthough there is scientific evidence supporting the claim, the evidence is not conclusive.\u201d \\ \\hline Third Level & C & \u201cSome scientific evidence suggests... however, FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive.\u201d \\ \\hline Fourth Level & D & \u201cVery limited and preliminary scientific research suggests... FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim.\u201d \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nFrom Guidance for Industry and FDA: Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data.\n\n***The language reflects wording used in qualified health claims as to which the agency has previously exercised enforcement discretion for certain dietary supplements. During this interim period, the precise language as to which the agency considers exercising enforcement discretion may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Standardized Qualifying Language for Qualified Health Claims.\n\nFDA has only limited resources for reviewing health claims. Thus, to maximize the public health benefit of its claims review process, FDA intends to prioritize on a case-by-case basis all complete petitions according to several factors, including whether the food or dietary supplement that is the subject of the petition is likely to have a significant impact on a serious or life-threatening illness; the strength of the evidence; whether consumer research has been provided to show the claim is not misleading; whether the substance of the claim has undergone an FDA safety review (i.e., is an authorized food additive, has been GRAS (generally recognized as safe) affirmed, listed, or has received a letter of \"no objection\" to a GRAS notification); whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has been adequately characterized so that the relevance of available studies can be evaluated; whether the disease is defined and evaluated in accordance with generally accepted criteria established by a recognized body of qualified experts; and whether there is prior review of the evidence or the claim by a recognized body of qualified experts.\n3. Opportunity for Public Comment Upon filing of a petition, FDA intends to post the petition on its website and request public comment for 60 days. FDA plans to post comments submitted by the public on FDA's website or to make comments available for public review at the Division of Dockets Management, HFA-305.\n4. Scientific Review After the comment period closes, FDA may pursue any one of several options for scientific review of data submitted in a petition in support of the substance/disease relationship. For example, FDA may conduct the review internally, it may convene an advisory subcommittee, or it may use appropriate third-party reviewers under contract to FDA, e.g., the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ). In the case of a petition forwarded to AHRQ, AHRQ plans to send the petition to an Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC) with which it has a contract to review the scientific evidence in the petition and to rank the degree of scientific certainty of the validity of the substance/disease relationship. AHRQ also plans to ask the EPC to review those science-related public comments received by FDA that discuss or provide evidence. Within 120 days after the commencement of the third party review, FDA would expect to receive a report that includes a description of the evidence reviewed, an analysis of that evidence, a summary of and response to public comments that pertain to the evidence, and its assessment as to the degree of scientific certainty in support of the substance/disease relationship.\n5. Consolidation of Like Petitions_If FDA receives more than one petition for a qualified health claim that describes the same relationship between a substance and a disease or health-related condition during its review, the agency plans to consolidate all of the related petitions received, if appropriate.\n6. _Consultation with Other Federal Agencies To fully inform FDA's review, FDA intends, as appropriate, on a case-by-case-basis, to consult with other scientific Federal agencies with official responsibility for public health protection or research related to human nutrition and dietary supplements.\n7. Regulatory Decision As mentioned above, FDA plans to either conduct its own review or use an appropriate third party to conduct a scientific review. In the case of third party review, after FDA receives, for example the EPC report, FDA intends, based on the totality of the publicly available evidence, public comment, and other relevant regulatory considerations, to determine whether to consider exercising enforcement discretion with respect to the proposed claim. If FDA decides to consider exercising enforcement discretion, the agency plans to determine what qualifying statement(s) and other information should accompany the claim to ensure that it is truthful and not misleading. In reaching its determination, FDA intends to review and evaluate the third party report, the totality of the publicly available evidence, and all of the public comments submitted within the comment period, as well as consider how the proposed qualified claim will affect consumers' dietary choices. FDA also intends to consider whether to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to other requirements in 21 CFR 101.14, and what other factors, in addition to qualifying language, are relevant to considering the exercise of enforcement discretion.\n8. Notification to Petitioner On or before day 270 after receipt of the filed petition, FDA plans to notify the petitioner in a letter of: a) the agency's determination; b) the basis for its determination; and c) if the agency decides to consider exercising enforcement discretion, the qualified claim for which the agency intends to consider exercising such discretion and the provisions of 21 CFR 101.14 for which the agency intends to consider exercising such discretion. FDA also plans to notify the petitioner of any other factors the agency intends to consider in deciding whether to exercise enforcement discretion when the claim appears in labeling of conventional human food or dietary supplements. FDA plans to post the letter and any third party report on the agency's website.\n9. _Extensions_If the agency determines that it is appropriate, upon good cause, FDA may, decide to extend by 30-60 days the time period to notify the petitioner.\n\nReconsideration\n\nIf a petitioner or other party disagrees with an FDA determination, that party may request reconsideration. FDA intends to reconsider its determination if the party presents significant new relevant evidence or provides a persuasive analysis that the agency's interpretation of the original evidence was incorrect. FDA intends to use the same process described above for reconsideration of the agency's determination. FDA may, on its own initiative, decide to reconsider a determination.\n\nContent of Petitions\n\nRequirements\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.642770290374756", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTemporary Policy During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Regarding the Qualified Exemption from the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nMay 2020\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023.\n\nFor further information, refer to\n\n88 FR 15417, March 13, 2023.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nTemporary Policy During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Regarding the Qualified Exemption from the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to announce flexibility in the eligibility criteria for the qualified exemption from the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (Produce Safety Rule) (21 CFR Part 112) due to disruptions to the supply chain for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, and renewed for 90 days on April 21, 2020, effective April 26, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)). When the public health emergency concludes, FDA intends to issue additional guidance regarding the eligibility criteria for the qualified exemption from the Produce Safety Rule, which depends on the calculation of a three-year average as described below.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGiven this public health emergency, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 371(h)(1)(C)) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with statutory requirement and the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nCoronavirus\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists. (Jan. 31, 2020, renewed April 21, 2020), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nState and local governments across the United States have instituted public health orders resulting in the temporary closure or limited operational status of many restaurants, retail food establishments, and institutional food service establishments (including schools). These closures and limitations have had a significant impact on the supply chain for food by significantly reducing the demand for food normally sold to these establishments. These changes in the supply chain have impacted the ability of some farms to sell food to typical buyers and, consequently, may impact some farms' eligibility for a particular exemption under the Produce Safety Rule.3\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.1 Dualified Exemption under the Produce Safety Rule\n\nAs set forth in 21 CFR 112.5(a), a farm is eligible for a qualified exemption and associated modified requirements in a calendar year if during the previous three-year period preceding the applicable calendar year, the average annual monetary value of food the farm sold directly to qualified end-users exceeded the average annual monetary value of the food the farm sold to all other buyers during that period, and the average annual monetary value of all food the farm sold during the three-year period was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation.4 \"Qualified end-user\" is defined in 21 CFR 112.3 as the consumer of the food (where the term consumer does not include a business); or a restaurant or retail food establishment that is located in the same State or the same Indian reservation as the farm that produced the food or not more than 275 miles from such farm. The modified requirements with which qualified exempt farms must comply are described in 21 CFR 112.6 and include disclosing the name and complete business address of the farm where the produce was grown either on the label of the produce or at the point of purchase. These farms are also required to establish and keep certain documentation.\n\nFootnote 4: In the preamble to the final rule, \u201cStandards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption,\u201d the Agency described how a new farm can establish eligibility for a qualified exemption if it does not yet have three years of records. When a farm has not yet begun operations, the preamble states that, \u201cit would be reasonable for the farm to rely on a projected estimate of revenue (or market value) when it begins operations. We would evaluate the credibility of the projection considering factors such as the farm\u2019s number of employees.\u201d The preamble goes on to state that, \u201cAfter the farm has records for one or two preceding calendar years, it would be reasonable for the farm to make the calculation based on records it has (i.e., for one or two preceding calendar years) and we will accept records for the preceding one or two years as adequate to support its eligibility for a qualified exemption in these circumstances.\u201d (80 FR 74354 at 74413 (Nov. 27, 2015).) In section 3.1.2, we provide examples of how the temporary policy announced in this guidance will apply to farms in these situations.\n\n3.1.2 The Modified Exemption\n\nThe modified requirements with which qualified exempt farms must comply are described in 21 CFR 112.6 and include disclosing the name and complete business address of the farm where the produce was grown either on the label of the produce or at the point of purchase. These farms are also required to establish and keep certain documentation.\n\nFDA recognizes that the ability of farms to shift food sales to available buyers during the COVID-19 public health emergency has the potential to help reduce food shortages and food waste and to help support both farms and the U.S. economy. In order to support affected farms in selling food to all available buyers during the COVID-19 public health emergency, under the circumstances described in section 3.1.2 FDA does not intend to enforce the criteria for sales to qualified end-users when determining eligibility for the qualified exemption under the Produce Safety Rule, for the duration of the public health emergency.\n\n3.1.3 Discussion\n\nIn order to provide flexibility to affected farms during the COVID-19 public health emergency, under the circumstances described below FDA does not intend to enforce the requirement in 21 CFR 112.5(a)(1) that a majority of sales be to qualified end-users for a farm to be eligible for the qualified exemption under the Produce Safety Rule. This policy will apply to any calendar year during which the COVID-19 public health emergency is ongoing and will remain in effect until the public health emergency is terminated. FDA intends to provide timely notice about the eventual withdrawal of this policy. At that time, FDA intends to issue additional guidance, which will take into account comments received on and our experience with the implementation of this guidance, regarding how the three-year averages should be calculated moving forward.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Temporary Policy During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Regarding the Qualified Exemption from the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.739919662475586"], "Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: If the assay produces an equivocal result and/or has a re-test zone, then the assay has two cutoffs, E({}{1}) and E({}{2}). For the purpose of defining acceptable concentration ranges of negative and positive panel members, consider the lower bound of the equivocal or re-test zone as E({}{1}) and the upper bound as E({}{2}) noted below: If S/CO (<) E({}{1}) then the assay result is Negative If E({}{1}) (\\leq) S/CO (\\leq) E({}{2}) then the assay result is equivocal, or in the re-test zone. If S/CO (>) E({}{2}) then the assay result is Positive\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPositive panel members should be prepared so that approximately 60% - 80% of the samples have analyte levels close to the cutoffs. Of these samples, approximately one half should be close to the C({}{95}), calculated using E({}{2}) based on the precision of the old system, and the other half should be Moderate Positive samples. The remaining positive samples should evenly cover the full detection range of the assay. Among the samples close to the C({}_{95}), some samples should be in the equivocal zone (and/or in the re-test zone), as defined by the old system.\n\nNegative panel members should be prepared so that approximately 30% - 40% are High Negatives (close to the C({}{5}) calculated using E({}{1}) based on the precision of the old system). Because FDA is assessing clinical effectiveness based upon the result agreement for the assay performed with the two systems, these samples can have an analyte concentration below the cutoff such that repeat testing of these samples should be negative approximately 95% of the time. Alternatively, these High Negative samples may be obtained from archived clinical samples giving a signal just below the lower bound of the equivocal or re-test zone (E({}{1})). Among the samples close to the C({}{5}), some samples should be in the equivocal (and/or re-test) zone as defined by the old system.\n* It is preferable to use non-contrived clinical samples to create the panel members. However, where positive samples are not available or volumes are low, you should work with the FDA to define acceptable sample types. Positive panel members may be diluted in a clinical matrix in some cases. Preferably, individual negative samples should be used for each dilution. Spiked samples may be acceptable, but only from individual strong positives in the appropriate clinical matrix (i.e., the same sample cannot be used to prepare multiple panel samples).\n* Archived samples are acceptable if stored in accordance with the package insert instructions. The samples should be randomized and masked.\n\nb) Comparison Study Design\n\nYou should test the comparison panels on the old system at a minimum of one site. This may be done in-house. However, we recommend use of at least two of the old systems to better assess systematic differences between different old systems. The new system should be tested at a minimum of three sites (one may be in-house) with one or more reagent kit lots. Each panel member should be tested at least four times: once with the old system and three times with the new system. You should send the same positive and negative panels to each site, rather than dividing the panel between the three sites. Three different builds with unique serial numbers of the new system should be tested, one unique serial numbered system at each of the three sites.\n\nStatistical Analysis of Data\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe recommend you include the information described in Sections a-c below for each of the respective studies, in your submission:\n\nWithin-Laboratory Precision Study\n\nFor each sample tested, we recommend you present the mean value with variance components (standard deviation and percent CV) for numeric values for the new system. In addition, you should include the percent of values above and below the cutoff for each sample. You should also provide an estimation of C5 and C95 of the new system (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1).\n\nFor each analyte concentration, you should provide similar information for the old system. You can obtain this information from the precision study you originally used to demonstrate the performance of the old system, if the study design and the analyte concentration levels are comparable to those used to assess the new system. You can utilize information about variance components (standard deviation and percent CV) from the precision study found in the old system labeling. However, if the study design and analyte concentrations for the old system are different from those described in this document, a new precision study for the old system should be performed to allow for comparison between systems.\n\nFor similar analyte concentrations, we recommend you provide repeatability (within-run precision) and within-laboratory precision (standard deviation and percent CV) of the New and old systems (precision profiles of the New and old systems). In addition, you should provide the ratio of the standard deviations of the New and old systems along with the 95% confidence interval for this ratio. The confidence interval can be based on the F-statistic for a ratio of variances (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 2).\n\nReproducibility Study\n\nFor each analyte concentration level, we recommend you present the mean value with variance components (standard deviation and percent CV) for the new system, for each site separately and for all sites combined. In addition, for each panel member, you should include the percent of values above and below the cutoff, for each site separately and for all sites combined. You should also provide an estimation of C5 and C95 of the new system, for each site separately and for all sites combined.\n\nFor each analyte concentration level, we recommend you present similar information for the old system. This information can be taken from the precision study originally used to demonstrate the performance of the old system if the study design and the analyte concentration levels are comparable to those used to assess the new system. The information about variance components (standard deviation and percent CV) can be obtained from theprecision study found in the old system labeling. If the study design and analyte concentrations are different than those described in this document, a new precision study for the old system should be performed.\n\nFor similar concentrations, you should provide repeatability (within-run precision), within-laboratory precision (standard deviation and percent CV) and reproducibility separately and combined over three sites for the new systems and old system (precision profiles of the new system and old system). In addition, we recommend you provide the ratio of repeatability standard deviations along with 95% confidence intervals and the ratio of the reproducibility standard deviations of the New and old systems. The confidence intervals for the ratios can be based on the F-statistic for a ratio of variances (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 2).\n\nComparison Panels\n\nYou should provide a scatter-plot of S/CO or any other numeric values that differentiate between positive (reactive) and negative (non-reactive) of the old system (X-axis) vs. S/CO of the new system (Y-axis) with descriptive statistics, for data generated at each site as well as for all sites combined. Both axes should have the same scale, and the line of identity (y=x) should be presented. The same scale on the axes should be applied to the data from each site. In addition you should provide similar scatter plots for negative and positive specimens separately.\n\nYou should provide an estimation of systematic differences between the numeric values generated by the old system and the new system at each site and for all sites combined (CLSI document EP09). You should perform the appropriate regression analysis (Deming regression, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 3), which accounts for the random errors associated with the old and new system measurements and provide the 95% confidence intervals of the slope and intercept from the regression analysis. The emphasis should be placed on estimating the systematic difference between the numeric values of the old and new systems around the cutoff. You should also calculate the average systematic difference separately for the Negative, High Negative, Low Positive and High Positive samples of the comparison panel.\n\nWe recommend that you present tables (e.g., with old system results defined by the columns and new system results defined by the rows), for data derived from each site and for all data combined (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 4). For the qualitative assays with equivocal (and/or re-test zone), the results of the comparison study should be presented in 3-by-3 tables from data derived from each site and for all data combined (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 5). Based on these tables, you should calculate positive and negative percent agreements at each site along with the corresponding 95% two-sided confidence intervals (for confidence intervals, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 6). In addition, you should provide the positive and negative percent agreements averaged over three sites with the corresponding 95% two-sided confidence intervals. Because the same samples are used at all three sites, we suggest that a bootstrap approach may be useful for calculating such confidence intervals.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.2761197090148926", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: No additional assessment is warranted if unequivocal MEFL signal is observed at clinically relevant extrapolated exposures.\n\nAlternatively, pEFD studies can be used; however, negative results should be confirmed by a definitive study in the relevant species\n\nConducting in vivo EFD studies in series, as shown, can permit reduction in animal use, as 2nd in vivo assay is not warranted if the first study is positive.\n\n1.2.3 Pharmaceuticals Intended to Treat Severely Debilitating or Life-Threatening Diseases\n\nConsidering the risk/benefit for pharmaceuticals intended to treat severely debilitating or life-threatening conditions (compared to less severe chronic diseases) where the likelihood of pregnancy is low, the use of qualified alternative assay(s) can be considered an appropriate component of the EFD risk assessment (see Annex 2 Figure 2).\n\nFigure 1: Use of Alternative Assays for Pharmaceuticals Expected to be EFD Toxicants\n\nWhen a qualified alternative assay clearly predicts MEFL in the first species (e.g., rat) at clinically relevant extrapolated exposures, this can be considered, on a case-by-case basis, to sufficiently characterize the EFD risk. However, if the results are equivocal or thought to represent a false positive, definitive in vivo studies in one or two species should be conducted to assist human risk assessment. If no EFD signal is observed in the two definitive in vivo studies at appropriate exposure margins the results of the alternative assay could be considered of minimal concern for human risk. However, for alternative assays that have been qualified to predict human MEFL (i.e., not predicting only animal MEFL), additional data (e.g., mechanistic or genetic) should be provided to support a conclusion that the alternative assay results represent a false positive finding. If one or both of the in vivo studies are positive for EFD toxicity, the compound is considered to be positive for EFD risk. Conducting the studies in series, as shown in Annex 2 Figure 2, can allow for reduction in animal use, as the second in vivo assay would not be warranted if the first one is positive.\n\nIf the alternative assay for the first species predicts a negative outcome (i.e., no MEFL), a definitive in vivo EFD study in the second species should be conducted to confirm the assessment. If positive, the compound is considered positive for EFD risk. If negative, the compound is considered negative for EFD risk, and no further testing is generally warranted, unless it is judged that additional studies would significantly alter the risk assessment.\n\n1.2.4 Pharmaceuticals Intended to Treat Late-life Onset Diseases\n--------------------\nContext title: S5-R3_Step4_Guideline_2020_0218_1\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.226616859436035", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: Other specific features of the design may also deserve discussion, including presence or absence of washout periods and the duration of the treatment period, especially for a chronic illness. The rationale for dose and dose-interval selection should be explained, if it is not obvious. For example, once daily dosing with a short half-life drug whose effect is closely related in time to blood level is not usually effective; if the study design uses such dosing, this should be explained, e.g., by pointing to pharmacodynamic evidence that effect is prolonged compared to blood levels. The procedures used to seek evidence of \"escape\" from drug effect at the end of the dose-interval, such as measurements of effect just before dosing, should be described. Similarly, in a parallel design dose-response study, the choice of doses should be explained.\n\nSelection of Study Population\n\n9.3.1 Inclusion Criteria\n\nThe patient population and the selection criteria used to enter the patients into the study should be described, and the suitability of the population for the purposes of the study discussed. Specific diagnostic criteria used, as well as specific disease(e.g., disease of a particular severity or duration, results of a particular test or rating scale(s) or physical examination, particular features of clinical history, such as failure or success on prior therapy, or other potential prognostic factors and any age, sex, or ethnic factors) should be presented.\n\nScreening criteria and any additional criteria for randomization or entry into the test drug/investigational product treatment part of the trial should be described. If there is reason to believe that there were additional entry criteria, not defined in the protocol, the implications of these should be discussed. For example, some investigators may have excluded or entered into other studies patients who were particularly ill or who had particular baseline characteristics.\n\n9.3.2 Exclusion Criteria\n\nThe criteria for exclusion at entry into the study should be specified and the rationale provided (e.g., safety concerns, administrative reasons, or lack of suitability for the trial). The impact of exclusions on the generalizability of the study should be discussed in section 13 of the study report or in an overview of safety and efficacy.\n\n9.3.3 Removal of Patients From Therapy or Assessment\n\nThe predetermined reasons for removing patients from therapy or assessment observation, if any, should be described, as should the nature and duration of any planned followup observations in those patients.\n\n9.4 Treatments\n\n9.4.1 Treatments Administered\n\nThe precise treatments or diagnostic agents to be administered in each arm of the study, and for each period of the study, should be described including route and mode of administration, dose, and dosage schedule.\n\n9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products(s)\n\nIn the text of the report, a brief description of the test drug(s)/investigational product(s) (formulation, strength, batch number(s)) should be given. If more than one batch of test drug/investigational product was used, patients receiving each batch should be identified in Appendix 16.1.6.\n\nThe source of placebos and active control/comparator product(s) should be provided. Any modification of comparator product(s) from their usual commercial state should be noted, and the steps taken to assure that their bioavailability was unaltered should be described.\n\nFor long-duration trials of investigational products with limited shelf-lives or incomplete stability data, the logistics of resupply of the materials should be described. Any use of test materials past their expiry date should be noted, and patients receiving them identified. If there were specific storage requirements, these should also be described.\n\n9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups\n\nThe specific methods used to assign patients to treatment groups, e.g., centralized allocation, allocation within sites, adaptive allocation (that is, assignment on the basis of earlier assignment or outcome) should be described in the text of the report, including any stratification or blocking procedures. Any unusual features should be explained.\n\nA detailed description of the randomization method, including how it was executed, should be given in Appendix 16.1.7 with references cited if necessary. A table exhibiting the randomization codes, patient identifier, and treatment assigned should also be presented in the Appendix. For a multicenter study, the information should be given by center. The method of generating random numbers should be explained.\n\nFor a historically controlled trial, it is important to explain how the particul ar control was selected and what other historical experiences were examined, if any, and how their results compared to the control used.\n\n9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study\n\nThe doses or dose ranges used in the study should be given for all treatments and the basis for choosing them described (e.g., prior experience in humans, animal data).\n\n9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient\n\nProcedures for selecting each patient's dose of test drug/ investigational product and active control/comparator should be described. These procedures can vary from simple random assignment to a selected fixed drug/dose regimen, to use of a specified titration procedure, or to more elaborate response-determined selection procedures, e.g., where dose is titrated upward at intervals until intolerance or some specified endpoint is achieved. Procedures for back-titration, if any, should also be described.\n\nThe timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and the relation of dosing to meals should be described and, if timing was not specified, this should be noted.\n\nAny specific instructions to patients about when or how to take the dose(s) should be described.\n\n9.4.6 Blinding\n\nA description of the specific procedures used to carry out blinding should be provided (e.g., how bottles were labeled, use of labels that reveal blind-breakage, sealed code list/envelopes, double dummy techniques), including the circumstances in which the blind would be broken for an individual or for all patients (e.g., for serious adverse events), the procedures used to do this, and who had access to patient codes. If the study allowed for some investigators to remain unblinded (e.g., to allow them to adjust medication), the means of shielding other investigators should be explained. Measures taken to ensure that test drug/investigational product and placebo were indistinguishable and evidence that they were indistinguishable should be described, as should the appearance, shape, smell, and taste of the test material. Measures to prevent unblinding by laboratory measurements, if used, should be described. If there was a data monitoring committee with access to unblinded data, procedures to ensure maintenance of overall study blinding should be described. The procedure used to maintain the blinding when interim analyses were performed should also be explained.\n\nIf blinding was considered unnecessary to reduce bias for some or all of the observations, this should be explained; e.g., use of a random-zero sphygmomanometer eliminates possible observer bias in reading blood pressure and Holter tapes are often read by automated systems that are presumably immune to observer bias. If blinding was considered desirable but not feasible, the reasons and implications should be discussed. Sometimes blinding is attempted but is known to be imperfect because of obvious drug effects in at least some patients (dry mouth, bradycardia, fever, injection site reactions, changes in laboratory data). Such problems or potential problems should be identified and, if there were any attempts to assess the magnitude of the problem or manage it (e.g., by having endpoint measurements carried out by people shielded from information that might reveal treatment assignment), they should be described.\n\n9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy\n\nWhich drugs or procedures were allowed before and during the study, whether and how their use was recorded, and any other specific rules and procedures related to permitted or prohibited concomitant therapy should be described. How allowed concomitant therapy might affect the outcome due either to drug-drug interaction or to direct effects on the study endpoints should be discussed, and how the independent effects of concomitant and study therapies could be ascertained should be explained.\n\n9.4.8 Treatment Compliance\n\nThe measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance should be described, e.g., drug accountability, diary cards, blood, urine or other body fluid drug level measurements, or medication event monitoring.\n\nEfficacy and Safety Variables\n\n9.5.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart\n\nThe specific efficacy and safety variables to be assessed and laboratory tests to be conducted, their schedule (days of study, time of day, relation to meals, and the timing of critical measures in relation to test drug administration, e.g., just prior to next dose, 2 hours after dose), the methods for measuring them, and the persons responsible for the measurements should be described. If there were changes in personnel carrying out critical measurements, these should be reported.\n\nIt is usually helpful to display graphically in a flow chart (see Annex III of the guideline) the frequency and timing of efficacy and safety measurements; visit numbers and times should be shown, or, alternatively, times alone can be used (visit numbers alone are more difficult to interpret). Any specific instructions (e.g., guidance or use of a diary) to the patients should also be noted.\n--------------------\nContext title: E3 Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.909686088562012", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: Even when a single outcome variable is being assessed, if multiple facets of that outcome are analyzed (e.g., multiple dose groups, multiple time points, or multiple subject subgroups based on demographic or other characteristics) and if any one of the analyses is used to conclude that the drug has been shown to produce a beneficial effect, the multiplicity of analyses may cause inflation of the Type I error rate. Hence, by inflating the Type I error rate, multiplicity produces uncertainty in interpretation of the study results such that the conclusions about whether effectiveness has been demonstrated in the study become unreliable. There are various approaches that can be planned prospectively and applied to maintain the overall Type I error rate at 2.5% or below.\n\nFor controlling multiplicity, an important principle is to first prospectively specify all planned endpoints, time points, analysis populations, doses, and analyses; then, once these factors are specified, appropriate adjustments for multiple endpoints and analyses can be selected, prespecified, and applied, as appropriate. Changes in the analytic plan to perform additional analyses can reintroduce a multiplicity problem that can negatively impact the ability to interpret the study's results unless these changes are made prior to data analysis and appropriate multiplicity adjustments are performed. The statistical analysis plan should not be changed after unmasking of treatment assignments and performing statistical analyses.\n\nA focus of this guidance is control of the Type I error rate for the prespecified set of endpoints (i.e., primary and secondary endpoints) of a clinical trial to ensure that the major findings of a clinical trial are well supported, and the effects of the drug have been demonstrated. Analyses that explicate the characteristics of an effect on an endpoint that has been demonstrated--such as time of onset, distribution of effect sizes across the population, effects in subgroups, and effects on the components of a composite endpoint--are all descriptive to provide a deeper understanding of the nature of that endpoint finding, and do not extend to effects outside of that endpoint. These descriptive analyses can be considered for inclusion in the FDA-approved labeling without presenting p-values.\n\nOf note, there is not always a clear-cut distinction between an analysis closely related to a major finding and one that demonstrates additional effects. Therefore, when definitive conclusions are to be drawn, such analyses should be prespecified and appropriately included in the prespecified multiple-testing strategy. A descriptive analysis that is not included in the prespecified multiple-testing strategy should not be presented in FDA-approved labeling in ways that imply a statistically rigorous conclusion or convey certainty about the effects that are not supported by that trial. Descriptive analyses are not the subject of this guidance and are not addressed in detail.\n\n3 Multiple endpoints: general principles\n\nThe Hierarchy of Families of Endpoints\n\nEndpoints in adequate and well-controlled drug trials are usually grouped hierarchically, often according to their clinical importance, but also taking into consideration the expected frequency of the endpoint events and anticipated drug effects. The critical determination for grouping endpoints is whether they are intended to establish effectiveness to support approval or intended to demonstrate additional meaningful effects. Endpoints critical to establish effectiveness for approval are often designated as primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints can provide useful description to support the primary endpoint(s) and/or demonstrate additional clinically important effects. The third category in the hierarchy includes all other endpoints, which are referred to as exploratory. Exploratory endpoints can include endpoints for research purposes or for new hypotheses generation. Each category in the hierarchy can contain a single endpoint or a family of endpoints.\n\n3.1.1 Primary Endpoint Family\n\nThe endpoint(s) that establish the effect(s) of the drug and will be the basis for concluding that the study meets its objective are designated the primary endpoint family. When there is a single prespecified primary endpoint, there are no multiple-endpoint-related multiplicity issues in the determination that the study achieves its objective.\n\nMultiple primary endpoints occur in three ways, further described in section III.C. The first is when there are multiple primary endpoints, and each endpoint could be sufficient on its own to establish the drug's efficacy. These multiple endpoints thus correspond to multiple chances of success, and in this case, failure to adjust for multiplicity can lead to Type I error rate inflation and a false conclusion that the drug is effective. The second is when the determination of effectiveness depends on success on all primary endpoints, when there are two or more primary endpoints. In this setting, there are no multiplicity issues related to primary endpoints, as there is only one path that leads to a successful outcome for the trial and therefore, no concern with Type I error rate inflation. In the third, critical aspects of effectiveness can be combined into a single primary composite or other multicomponent endpoint, thereby avoiding multiple-endpoint-related multiplicity issues. For example, in many cardiovascular studies it is usual to combine several endpoints (e.g., cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke) into a single composite endpoint that is primary and to consider death a secondary endpoint (see section III.A.2.).\n\nii.1.2 Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint Families\n\nWhen an effect on the primary endpoint is shown, the secondary endpoints can be formally tested. A secondary endpoint could be a clinical effect related to the primary endpoint that extends the understanding of that effect (e.g., an effect on survival when a cardiovascular drug has shown an effect on the primary endpoint of heart failure-related hospitalizations) or provide evidence of a clinical benefit distinct from the effect shown by the primary endpoint (e.g., a disability endpoint in a multiple sclerosis treatment trial in which relapse rate is the primary endpoint). As a general principle, it is important to include the secondary endpoints that can potentially provide evidence of additional effects of the drug on the disease or condition in the Type I error control plan.\n\nIn general, it may be desirable to limit the number of secondary endpoints, because if multiplicity adjustments are used, the chance of demonstrating an effect on any secondary endpoint may become increasingly small as the number of secondary endpoints increases, or if a hierarchy is used, the important hypotheses further down the hierarchy might never get tested.\n\nExploratory endpoints do not need multiplicity adjustment because they are generally not used to support conclusions.\n\nii.1.3 Selecting and Interpreting the Endpoints in the Primary and Secondary Endpoint Families\n\nPositive results on the secondary endpoints can be interpretable if there is first a demonstration of a treatment effect on the primary endpoint family (O'Neill, 1997). The overall Type I error rate should control for the primary and secondary endpoint families all together.\n\nOccasionally, there are trials where a clinically important endpoint (e.g., mortality or irreversible morbidity) is expected to have too few events to provide adequate power for the trial, while a different clinically important endpoint occurs more frequently or earlier in the disease process, leading to larger power. In such cases, generally the endpoint with inadequate power for detection is classified as a secondary endpoint, while the endpoint for which larger power is expected is classified as the primary endpoint. For example, in some oncology trials, progression-free survival is selected as the primary endpoint, and overall survival is selected as the secondary endpoint because an effect of treatment on disease progression is clinically important and may be more readily demonstrable, may be detected earlier, and may often be larger because the observed effect on overall survival can be impacted by subsequent treatment post progression.\n\nType II Error Rate and Sample Size\n\nFDA is also concerned with the risk of making a Type II error, which is failing to show an effect of a drug where there actually is one. The study power is the probability that the study will be successful if a treatment effect of a specified size is in fact present. The desired power is an important factor in determining the sample size, especially for the primary endpoints.\n\nThe sample size of a study is generally chosen to provide a reasonably high power to show a treatment effect if an effect of a specified size on the primary endpoint(s) is in fact present. The sample size calculation may need to account for the statistical adjustments to control the Type I error rate for multiplicity. For example, if a lower (\\alpha) level is used for a study endpoint, then the sample size should be adjusted to provide desired statistical power for this endpoint.\n--------------------\nContext title: Multiple Endpoints in Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.364856719970703", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: Concluding equivalence or non-inferiority based on observing a non-significant test result of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the investigational product and the active comparator is inappropriate.\n\nThere are also special issues in the choice of analysis sets. Subjects who withdraw or dropout of the treatment group or the comparator group will tend to have a lack of response, and hence the results of using the full analysis set (see Glossary) may be biased toward demonstrating equivalence (see Section 5.2.3).\n\n3.3.3 Trials to Show Dose-response Relationship\n\nHow response is related to the dose of a new investigational product is a question to which answers may be obtained in all phases of development, and by a variety of approaches (see ICH E4). Dose-response trials may serve a number of objectives, amongst which the following are of particular importance: the confirmation of efficacy; the investigation of the shape and location of the dose-response curve; the estimation of an appropriate starting dose; the identification of optimal strategies for individual dose adjustments; the determination of a maximal dose beyond which additional benefit would be unlikely to occur. These objectives should be addressed using the data collected at a number of doses under investigation, including a placebo (zero dose) wherever appropriate. For this purpose the application of procedures to estimate the relationship between dose and response, including the construction of confidence intervals and the use of graphical methods, is as important as the use of statistical tests. The hypothesis tests that are used may need to be tailored to the natural ordering of doses or to particular questions regarding the shape of the dose-response curve (e.g. monotonicity). The details of the planned statistical procedures should be given in the protocol.\n\nGroup Sequential Designs\n--------------------\nContext title: E9_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.019872188568115", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: Outcome measure: Whether or not a study includes a particular outcome measure is not always evident from the title, abstract, or keywords. Broad criteria are necessary to avoid excluding relevant studies. For example, if the outcome of interest is specific to a disease, it would be appropriate to include citations for studies in which a drug is used for the treatment of that disease. The evaluation of the full text of the study report may be necessary to determine if the outcomes of interest were used in the study.\n\nFor those citations with insufficient information to enable a screening evaluation using the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the protocol should allow for an evaluation of the full report in the eligibility phase of the study. For example, some citations (particularly those in foreign languages and/or without abstracts) do not have a sufficiently detailed title to allow for an appropriate screening assessment. If, after reviewing the full text, the reviewer determines that the report does not meet the screening criteria, it should be included in the counts of reports that did not pass the screening phase of the SR.\n\nGenerally, the eligibility criteria build upon screening criteria and require more specific information that is found in the full text of the study report.\n\nExamples of eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria:\n\nTreatment: For many SRs, eligible studies include a specific drug product (including the intended formulation). Criteria should be established to allow for confirmation of formulation and other information as needed and consistent with the purpose of the SR.\n\nAnimal information: If certain animal characteristics (e.g., disease state) are critical to the objectives of the study, these should be defined in the eligibility criteria.\n\nOutcome measure(s): Outcome measures should be defined with the specificity necessary for the objectives of the study. Typically, these outcome measures are described with the same level of detail as required for a prospective study to demonstrate the safety oreffectiveness of the new animal drug.\n\nConfounding factors: If certain confounding factors would invalidate the interpretation of the study in accordance with the review question, these should be described in the eligibility criteria. For example, if the SR is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an antiparasitic drug against a certain parasite, the administration of an additional concurrent antiparasitic drug with known activity against that parasite in a study would not allow the inclusion of that study in the SR.\n\nData extraction plan:\n\nThe protocol should describe the methods for data extraction from studies that meet the screening and eligibility criteria. The data extracted from the study should include qualitative and/or quantitative information (depending on the objectives of the SR), information related to the screening and eligibility determination, characteristics that relate to the quality of the study, and data necessary for the synthesis and analysis of the data (if applicable).\n\nExamples of the information that may be extracted from each study include, but are not limited to: authors, year of publication, study animal identifying information (class, breed, age, physiological condition, etc.), case definition, location of study, identification of treatment or control arm, number of animals treated, number of animals used in the statistical analysis, product specific information (formulation, dose, route of administration, etc.), endpoint identification, use of a concurrent control group, experimental unit, randomization information, use of masking, quality standard to which the study was conducted (GCP, GLP, unknown), identification of any quality assurance or monitoring procedures, qualifications of study personnel, availability of raw data, how endpoint variability is reported (error mean square, standard error of the mean, etc.), and identification of any field safety assessments (e.g., clinical exams, clinical pathology, necropsy, and/or histopathology). Contact with authors or access to raw data may be helpful in addressing gaps in data availability or quality assessment that exist in the publications (e.g., for verification of masking, exclusion of publications due to lack of information, connecting the formulation in the publication to the formulation to be evaluated in the CMC technical section).\n\nThe extracted data should be entered into an appropriate database which can be used for quantitative or qualitative evaluation.\n\nStudy quality assessment\n\nThe protocol should describe the assessment criteria for individual studies in order to identify study limitations such as lack of allocation concealment, lack of masking, completeness of data, and incomplete or selective accounting of outcomes. The criteria and methods for the assessment should be defined in the protocol to ensure consistent application for each study.\n\nThe protocol should select the most likely types of bias to evaluate based on the types of studies (e.g., RCTs, observational).21 At a minimum, the protocol should describe the assessment of bias in individual studies; define the criteria for the determination that the risk of bias is \"high,\" \"low,\" or \"uncertain\" for each bias type; and state that the support for the assessment will be documented as part of the data extraction process.\n\nFootnote 21: \u201cSuggested risk of bias criteria for EPOC reviews. EPOC Resources for review authors.\u201d Available at: https://epoc.cohrane.org/resources/epoc-resources-review-authors - Accessed on March 2, 2023.\n\nThe protocol should state how the SR will be assessed for the overall quality of evidence, including, but not limited to, assessment of individual study limitations, research group bias (e.g., if the bulk of data comes from one group and how that is weighted), reporting biases (e.g., publication bias, time lag bias, location bias, citation bias, language bias, outcome reporting bias), magnitude of effect, dose response, precision of estimates, consistency of results, and directness of evidence.\n\nStatistical analysis methodology:\n\nThe protocol for each study should describe the plan for the qualitative or quantitative assessment, depending on the objectives of the study, including any statistical analysis or risk assessment approach. If the intent of the SR is to conduct a meta-analysis, the protocol should include appropriate methods for statistical analysis and assessment of bias which are adequate to assess the effects of the new animal drug. For additional information on meta-analysis, see section III.B.4. Meta-analysis below.\n\nResults presentation:\n\nThe protocol should describe the methods that will be used to present the findings of the study (forest plots, summary of findings tables, etc.). In addition to the findings presented, complete references including complete and accurate English translations of foreign language references must be provided (21 CFR 514.1(a)) and any raw data available for the studies included in the assessment should be provided.\n\nBasis of study conclusion:\n\nThe protocol should describe the methods that will be used to evaluate the quality of the evidence and interpretation of the results of any statistical analyses. The discussion should identify remaining gaps and characterize any limitations to the conclusions that may be drawn from the literature or caveats which exist. Sponsors should formulate proposals addressing any gaps by means of a field study, protocol-controlled retrospective study, or other acceptable method.\n\n4 Meta-analysis\n\nDepending on the objective and endpoints of the systematic review, CVM may recommend a meta-analysis within an SR. The term meta-analysis, as used in this document, refers to the combining of evidence from relevant studies using appropriate statistical methods to allow inference to be made to the population of interest.22 Results from the meta-analysis provide a more general estimate of the effect than those derived from individual studies. A meta-analysis includes an estimate of effect size (the strength or the magnitude of the effect of an independent variable [treatment] on a dependent variable [outcome] in an experiment) and an evaluation of statistical significance of effect size (this includes an evaluation of variation of effect size between and within studies, and an assessment of bias).\n\nSubject level data is not required to conduct a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis may be conducted with data aggregated to the level of each treatment group, combined treatment groups, or study. For example, the mean, variance, proportion, effect size, number of successes, number of failures, and sample size from each treatment group, combined treatment group, or study, may be used as data values or may be used in combination to calculate data values for the outcome of interest.\n\nFootnote 22: From draft GFI, \u201cMeta-Analyses of Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials to Evaluate the Safety of Human Drugs or Biological Products\u201d (November 2018). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\na. Meta-analysis protocol:\n\nProcedures for the meta-analysis should be provided in the SR protocol which should include a complete statistical analysis plan with sufficient details to address the type of outcome to be analyzed (e.g., mean, proportion, score), the model or statistical method (e.g., generalized linear mixed model, Kaplan-Meier curves), and any factors to be included in the analysis (fixed effects, random effects, etc.). The statistical analysis plan should also include details and criteria to address the following elements: the power of the meta-analysis, investigation of heterogeneity, investigation of sensitivity of the findings, publication bias, and decision rule.\n\nThe power of the meta-analysis\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.369139194488525"], "Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In the context of ICH M7(R2), (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are considered an appropriate initial evaluation of mutagenic potential of an impurity at a daily dose of less than or equal to 1 mg. When a structural alert is identified, a follow-up in vitro evaluation (e.g., bacterial reverse mutation assay) could be conducted, or the impurity could be controlled by threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). Negative results in either evaluation would classify the impurity under Class 5. The result of the bacterial reverse mutation assay overrules the (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nAdditionally, impurities should not be assigned to Class 5 based solely on the absence of structural alerts by visual evaluation alone. There is an expectation that structural alert assessment will be conducted using (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nQ3. What are the expectations for evaluation of the genotoxic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity exceeds 1 mg daily dose? (1.3)\n\nIn the context of Note 1 of ICH M7(R2), 1 mg refers to an absolute amount of an impurity, irrespective of the identification or qualification thresholds outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B(R2).\n\nIn cases where the amount of impurity is less than 1 mg daily dose for chronic administration, and an impurity generated negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems, a minimum screen of genotoxicity studies (point mutation and chromosomal aberration) could be considered.\n\nQ4.: If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg daily dose, is further genetic toxicity testing warranted? (1.4)\n\nNo. If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg/day, further genetic toxicity testing is not warranted.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nQ5.: Are semisynthetic drug substances and drug products included in the scope of ICH M7(R2)? (2.1)\n\nYes, for certain cases. If a semisynthetic drug substance, as defined in the ICH guidance for industry Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances (November 2012), is manufactured using steps that could introduce mutagenic impurities or degradation products (e.g., postmodification of a fermentation product, late-stage introduction of a linker), a risk assessment is warranted.\n\nThe following compounds used in the manufacturing process of semisynthetic drug substances and drug products should be considered within the scope of the application of ICH M7(R2):\n\nChemically synthesized intermediates and actual impurities therein\n\nReagents\n\nIII GENERAL PRINCIPLES (3)\n\nQ6.: Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n\nNo. Carcinogens that are negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay do not have a DNA reactive mechanism of carcinogenicity and, therefore, are not in the scope of ICH M7(R2) (e.g., acetamide, hydroxylamine).\n\nQ7.: Should mutagenic, noncarcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.2)\n\nNo. Mutagens that are demonstrated to be noncarcinogenic in appropriate and well-conducted animal bioassays will be classified as Class 5 impurities.\n\nIV Considerations for Marketed Products (4)\n\nWhat does \"significant increase in clinical dose\" mean in section IV.C., Changes to the Clinical Use of the Marketed Products, (4.3)? (4.1)\n\nAny increase in dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that would increase any mutagenic impurity to levels above the acceptable limits is considered significant (see Tables 2 and 3 in ICH M7(R2) and the ICH guidance for industry M7(R2) Addendum: Application of the Principles of the ICH M7 Guidance to Calculation of Compound-Specific Acceptable Intakes (July 2023)).\n\nIn such cases a reevaluation of the mutagenic impurity limits is recommended.\n\nV DRUG SUBSTANCE AND DRUG PRODUT IMPURITY ASSESSMENT (5)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section. (5.1)\n\nVI HAZARD ASSESSMENT ELEMENTS (6)\n\nWhat information and/or documentation should be provided to regulatory agencies to sufficiently demonstrate validation of (Q)SAR models that are developed in-house or are not commonly used? (6.1)\n\nSection VI (6) of ICH M7(R2) states that \"(Q)SAR models utilizing these prediction methodologies should follow the general validation principles set forth by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\" (OECD Validation 2007).\n\nIn the context of ICH M7(R2), the OECD principles of (Q)SAR validation are:\n\nA defined endpoint -- The model should be trained using experimental data generated according to the standard OECD protocol for the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay.\n\nAn unambiguous algorithm -- The algorithm used to construct the model should be disclosed. It should be clear whether the model is considered statistical (constructed via machine learning) or expert rule based (created from human expert-derived knowledge).\n\nA defined domain of applicability -- It should be described whether a test chemical falls within the model's applicability domain and how the applicability domain is calculated. The user should be warned when the model does not have enough information to make a reliable prediction on a chemical.\n\nAppropriate measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness, and predictivity -- The model should be evaluated and shown to be sufficiently predictive of bacterial reverse mutagenicity. Standard validation techniques that should be used are recall, crossvalidation, and external validation. Evidence that the model has not been over-fit should also be provided.\n\nA mechanistic interpretation -- Is there adequate information to allow an assessment of mechanistic relevance to be made (e.g., specific descriptors)?\n\nFor any system as a minimum recommendation to demonstrate how each model follows these principles and to understand how a (Q)SAR model was developed and validated, the sponsor is expected to provide the OECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) (OECD QMRF 2017) on request by the regulatory agency. This template summarizes and reports key information on (Q)SAR models, including the results of any validation studies as well as provides supplementary information on applicability of the model to a given chemical. Agencies may request this information depending on the experience of the specific agency with the specific models.\n\nQ11. When an out-of-domain or noncoverage result is obtained from one of the two (Q)SAR models as described in ICH M7(R2), can the impurity be classified as a Class 5 impurity? (6.2)\n\nNo, an out-of-domain or noncoverage result from one of the two (Q)SAR models warrants additional assessment to classify the compound as a Class 5 impurity.\n\nGiven that the relationship between chemical structure and DNA reactivity is well understood, it is unlikely that a structure with mutagenic potential would be associated with an out-of-domain result. However, expert review can provide reassurance in assignment of such impurities to Class 5.\n\nExpert review may include one or a combination of the following (Amberg et. al. 2019):\n\nComparison to structurally similar analogs for which bacterial reverse mutation assay data are available (read-across approach).\n\nExpert review of the chemical structure to determine if there is potential for the chemical to react with DNA.\n\n(Q)SAR output from an additional validated model (see Question Q10 (6.1)) of the same methodology (i.e., expert rule based or statistical) that generates a prediction that is within its applicability domain.\n\nIn a case where an impurity is demonstrated to be negative in an Ames test but positive in a clastogenicity study (e.g., chromosomal aberration test), how would the impurity be classified per ICH M7(R2) classification system? (6.3)\n\nIf an impurity tests negative in an Ames assay, it is considered a Class 5 impurity. Addressing positive results in a clastogenicity assay is out of the scope of ICH M7(R2).\n\nPlease clarify the rationale for the tests included under Note 3 as a follow-up to investigate the in vivo relevance of in vitro mutagens. (6.4)\n\nIf an impurity is positive in the Ames test, and levels of the impurity cannot be controlled to an appropriate acceptable limit, an in vivo follow-up test with mutagenic endpoint (mutagenicity) should be used. The other follow-up tests outlined in Note 3 are also acceptable when scientific rationale (as indicated in Note 3) is provided to support their uses.\n\nFor any of the above tests, adequate exposure should be demonstrated in line with the ICH guidance for industry S2(R1) Genotoxicity Testing and Data Interpretation for Pharmaceuticals Intended for Human Use (June 2012).\n\nVII Risk Characterization (7)\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are negative, is that sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance? (7.1)\n\nYes. A well-conducted and scientifically justified in vivo study (see Question Q13 (6.4) in this document) is sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance. If the results of the in vivo study are negative, the impurity can be assigned to ICH M7(R2) Class 5.\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity cannot be controlled to an acceptable limit and is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are positive, does that support setting compound-specific impurity limits? (7.2)\n\nWhen a mutagenic impurity cannot be controlled to the TTC (or less than lifetime (LTL) based limit), results from an appropriate in vivo assay could complement the available data for a weight of evidence approach to support a higher limit on a case-by-case basis. However, in vivo gene mutation assays alone are currently not validated to directly assess cancer risk because the endpoint is mutation and not carcinogenicity (i.e., they are used for hazard identification).\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6767758131027222", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)?

However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n\n[5.10] Do all steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish people- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in Section 3.2.S.2.2.

While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6391323804855347", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)?

(3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: For mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, given the proximity to the final product, Option 1 control approach is preferred. However, Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches may be possible when appropriately justified. The control strategy may be influenced by the presence of a subsequent recrystallization step, a highly effective purification operation (e.g., chromatography, well-defined crystallization), the reactivity (e.g., highly reactive reagents such as thionyl chloride) and physical characteristics of the impurity (e.g., low boiling point such as methyl chloride), and the availability of data (analytical data supporting the purge assessment). In most cases, for mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, the justification of an Option 4 control approach solely based on prediction is not sufficient and supporting analytical data should be provided (see Question Q19 (8.1)).\n\nIs periodic verification testing (i.e., skip testing) allowed for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches? (8.4)\n\nNo. Periodic verification testing is not appropriate for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches. In ICH M7(R2) section VIII.A (8.1), periodic verification testing is only discussed as a control strategy when using Option 1 control approach.\n\nThe Option 1 periodic verification testing strategy references the ICH guidance for industry Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances (ICH Q6A) (December 2000). The Option 1 periodic verification testing concept (per ICH Q6A) should generally be implemented after approval and applies to testing in the final drug substance.\n\nIf batch analysis data on the drug substance for a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI in multiple batches, is that sufficient to justify no specification of that impurity in the control strategy? (8.5)\n\nNo. Batch data alone demonstrating that a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI is not sufficient to apply an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nHowever, if there is negligible risk of the impurity to be present in the drug substance, an Option 4 control strategy may be considered with appropriate justification. See Questions Q19 and Q20 (8.1 and 8.2) for recommendations on supporting an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nWhat scale considerations are relevant when generating analytical data in support of control Options 3 and 4? (8.6)\n\nLab scale experiments are typically sufficient when generating measured purge factors or when defining in-process control points. These studies should employ conditions representative of the final process as described in the application and should consider the potential impact of scale and equipment-related differences between the laboratory and production environment (e.g., the effects of mixing on impurity levels in heterogeneous systems, the quality of liquid-liquid phase separations). In the case of observed scale dependencies, confirmatory testing on batches manufactured at pilot or commercial scale may be advisable. There is no expectation to perform spiking studies at pilot or commercial scale.\n\nIX Documentation (9)\n\nIf (Q)SAR predictions are made during drug development, should they be repeated for the marketing application? (9.1)*\n\n(Q)SAR models developed for use under ICH M7(R2) are generally updated regularly with new bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and more refined structural alerts. A Sponsor is not expected to update its (Q)SAR assessment during drug development unless there is a safety concern such as when newly available bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and/or mechanistic knowledge suggest that the prediction is incorrect. As an example, in cases where there is reason to question the outcome of a negative prediction (e.g., an aromatic amine is present, but the model gave a negative prediction), a reassessment is recommended. It is recommended that the sponsor rerun (Q)SAR predictions before the initial marketing application to ensure predictions reflect the most current data available. If the marketing application is later submitted in other regulatory jurisdictions, reassessment may be considered. Reassessment may also be considered if the predictions made for the initial global marketing application did not use a recent version of the software.\n\nIn general, predictions generated with models developed before ICH M7's publication in 2014 are considered unacceptable.\n\nFor marketing applications, what content and common technical document (CTD) placement recommendations could improve the clarity of an ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy? (9.2)*\n\nIn Module 2, a brief summary of the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be included (sections 2.3 and 2.6).\n\nIn Module 3, the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be provided in detail. This type of information is recommended to be placed in the CTD locations per the ICH guidances for industry M4Q: The CTD -- Quality (August 2001) and related M4: The CTD -- Quality: Questions and Answers/Location Issues (June 2004)(e.g., 3.2.S.3.2 Impurities or 3.2.S.4.5 Justification of Specification for drug substance; 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities or 3.2.P.5.6 Justification of Specification for drug product). A table summary of the ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment and ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy is recommended to improve clarity.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment table includes impurity chemical structure, individual (Q)SAR results (positive/negative predictions, out of domain), bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay results (positive/negative, if available),ICH M7(R2) impurity class (1 to 5) assignment, and supporting information (e.g., information/links for bacterial reverse mutagenicity assays, literature reports, (Q)SAR expert analysis). The in silico systems used (name, version, endpoint) can also be noted.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy table includes impurity origin (e.g., synthetic step introduced, degradant), ICH M7(R2) class, purge factors (e.g., measured or predicted), ICH M7(R2) control option (1 to 4), control strategy (i.e., including in-process or compound testing rationale), and supporting information (e.g., information/links for justifications, calculations). The maximum daily dose, TTC, and proposed duration of treatment can also be noted.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended that compound code names be cross-referenced, if Module 3 and Module 4 (including toxicity study reports) use different compound naming conventions.\n\nIn Module 4, full safety study-related information on impurities (e.g., bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay reports, (Q)SAR reports, other genotoxicity test reports, additional testing) should be included to support the risk assessment and control strategy. This information is often placed in section 4.2.3.7.6 Impurities (see the ICH guidance for industry M4S: The CTD -- Safety(August 2001) for additional information) and can be cross-referenced to Module 3 by hyperlinks.\n\nX Illustrative Examples (10)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nXI Glossary (11)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance Documents\n\nOECD Validation, 2007, Test No. 69: Guidance Document on the Validation of (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) Models (available at\n\nhttp://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf?cote=env/jm/mono(2007)2&doclang usage=en)\n\nOECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF), 2017, Joint Research Center QSAR Model Database: User Support and Tutorial (available at\n\nhttps://publications.irc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC107491/kina28713enn.pdf)\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4061175286769867", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Mutagenic substances that are impurities in commercially available chemicals or synthetic intermediates, or that are formed as the result of side reactions during the synthesis, could also be present in the drug substance at levels relevant to safety. However, such mutagenic impurities and by-products are usually present at much lower concentrations than reagents, solvents, and intermediates. Therefore, the risk that such impurities will carry over significantly into the drug substance from early reaction steps is lower than for reagents, solvents, or intermediates from the same steps. The applicant should use risk-based reasoning to determine which steps to include in the hazard assessment for this category of potential impurity, and include a discussion of the risk assessment when identifying the point in the synthesis where these impurities and by-products are included in the assessment.\n\nInformation collected during the evaluation of potential mutagenic impurities can be submitted in an application and could be valuable for multiple purposes. For example, the justification for a proposed starting material should include information demonstrating that none of the steps immediately upstream (i.e., earlier in the synthesis) of the proposed starting material impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy can be supported with information about any mutagenic impurities formed or purged in the manufacturing steps between the proposed starting material and the drug substance, or that are controlled in the specification of the proposed starting material. The ICH Q11 exception for impurities that \"persist\" is also applicable to mutagenic impurities (see Q&A 5.8). In addition, steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities may be upstream of the starting material if they do not impact the impurity profile of the drug substance (see Q&A 5.10).\n\nThe approaches outlined in this Q&A are consistent with the principles in ICH M7 concerning hazard assessment, risk characterisation of mutagenic impurities, and their control. However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.2097318172454834", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)?

One batch of bulk granulation (or blend) should be used to manufacture all the strengths proposed. The other two bulk granulations (or blends) can be used to manufacture only the lowest and the highest strengths, in addition to the strength used in BE studies (i.e., the strength(s) tested in the BE studies should have three batches). Stability testing should still use all three batches of drug product.\n\nAre differences in the capsule shell (i.e., imprint, color, size, etc.), allowed in cases where a multi-strength capsule product is dose-proportional across all strengths (based on common bead blend)?\n\nYes differences in the capsule shell are allowed in the described case.\n\nWhat are the criteria for an exception to the recommendations regarding minimum size for pilot scale for ANDA submission batches? What justification would be needed if we wanted to deviate from these guidance recommendations?\n\nThe submission ANDA batches can have a smaller size than the established pilot scale, according to the ICH definition, when any one of the following circumstances prevails:\n\nThe reference listed drug product has an orphan drug designation.\n\nUse of a controlled drug substance is based on a Drug Enforcement Administration allocation.\n\nThe test batch size is the same as the commercial batch size with the commitment that a prior approval supplement (PAS) will be provided when there is a scale-up.\n\nAre scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n\nNo. The three ANDA submission batches should maintain the chosen formula based on product development studies for components and composition.\n\nCan FDA provide specific examples of cases where statistical analysis is required and the type of statistical analysis needed?\n\nThe FDA stability guidance recommends analysis of data in accordance with ICH Q1E, Appendix A. The flowchart in that guidance provides clear situations where analysis is normally recommended or unnecessary. In addition, ICH Q1E B.7 figures provide example diagrams for assay and degradation products that illustrate how plots should be generated for the three batches using regression lines and upper and lower confidence limits.\n\nHow many batches of drug product should be tested for split-portions of scored tablets?\n\nIn general, one batch testing for each scored strength on the split tablets will suffice, as recommended in the guidance for industry, _Tablet Scoring: Nomenclature, Labeling, and Data for Evaluation.19 Footnote 19: See footnote 2.\n\nFor drug products that include placebo tablets, how many batches (of placebo tablets) are required for submission? Is 6 months of stability data on the placebo tablets needed if the ANDA is submitted after the June 2014 deadline?\n\nOne batch of placebo tablets with full CMC information should be included at the time of ANDA submission; however, the final packaging presentation (containing the placebo tablets) should have data from accelerated and long-term stability testing. Six months of accelerated and long-term stability data are recommended for the entire packaging presentation including placebo tablets, where applicable, at the time of submission.\n\nAppendix D Amendments to Pending ANDA Application\n\nWhat are the recommendations for amendments and responses filed to pending ANDAs after issuance of the final FDA stability guidance?__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA1: All amendments submitted to pending ANDAs after the effective date of the final FDA stability guidance will be held to the standards in place concerning stability data at the time of the original ANDA submission, unless there is a concern with the submitted stability data.\n\nStability Studies\n\nWhat will be the expected testing time points on accelerated conditions?\n\nA1: The applicant should test at 0 (initial release), 3, and 6 months; for additional time points on accelerated conditions, please follow ICH Q1A(R2) recommendations for all ANDAs.20\n\nFootnote 20: This recommendation also applies to nasal spray, inhalation solution, suspension, aerosols, and liposomal drug products.\n\nCan the Agency clarify expectations for the storage positions for products placed into the stability program?\n\nA2: For primary batches of liquids, solutions, semi-solids, and suspensions, the product should be placed into an inverted (or horizontal) position and an upright (or vertical) position. For routine stability studies, the applicant should pick the worst case orientation for the study.\n\nWhen and how are reconstitution/dilution studies performed?\n\nA3: Recommendations listed in ICH Q1A(R2), section II, B, 7, Storage Conditions (2.2.7) should be followed for all three batches. These studies should be performed when the drug product is labeled for reconstitution or dilution.\n\nWhat types of containers are classified as semipermeable containers, and can the Agency clarify the stability expectations for the drug products in semipermeable containers?\n\nA4: Examples of semipermeable containers are provided in the ICH Q1A(R2) glossary. The recommendations for stability expectations for semipermeable containers are detailed in ICH Q1A(R2) section II, B, 7, c. Drug products packaged in semipermeable containers (2.2.7.3).\n\nCan the Agency clarify expectations around the number of batches to support tests such as preservative effectiveness and extractable leachable testing?\n\nA5: One of the primary batches of the drug product should be tested for antimicrobial preservative effectiveness (in addition to preservative content) at the end of the proposed shelf life. The drug product specification should include a test for preservative content, and this attribute should be tested in all stability studies. Extraction/leachable studies are generally one-time studies; however, if multiple types of containers/closures are employed for packaging, then additional studies could be recommended. Q6: When are in-use stability studies needed? A6: Please refer to response A3 under section E, Stability Studies. Q7: Are there changes to postapproval protocols and commitments when ICH stability guidances are implemented because of scale or type of batches submitted? A7: ICH Q1A(R2), section II, B, 8, Stability Commitment (2.2.8) addresses this question. Section 2.1.8 provides information regarding stability commitment for drug substances. Also, ANDAs and DMFs should include a commitment to place one batch of drug product and drug substance, respectively, into the annual long-term stability program, and to provide stability data in the annual reports.\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.9434428215026855", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: Significant body of information not available: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report. b.

Filing Documentation Prior approval supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\n4 Components and Composition -- Release Controlling Excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in release controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the excipient is critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications (i.e., mechanism of drug release and manufacturing process) for claiming any excipient(s) as a release controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes exceeding the ranges defined in each of the levels below may be allowed if considered to be within normal batch-to-batch variation and contained within an approved original application. In such situations, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division for further guidance.\n\nA. Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExample:\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation less than or equal to 5% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients in the original approved formulation.4 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the approved original application range.\n\nFootnote 4: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, ethylcellulose and a plasticizer, the ethylcellulose and plasticizer content should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients (e.g., ethylcellulose content increases by 2.5% and plasticizer content increases by 2.5%) relative to the original approved total release controlling excipient content weight in the modified release solid oral dosage form if it is to stay within the given range allowed for level 1.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na.

Level 2 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 2 changes are those that could have a significant impact on formulation quality and performance. Test documentation for a level 2 change would vary depending on whether the product could be considered to have a narrow therapeutic range.5\n\nFootnote 5: At present, there is no official CDER list of narrow therapeutic range drugs. A list was developed earlier in a preliminary attempt to identify drugs where there was greater concern that deviation from the specifications and potential changes in bioavailability could raise clinical issues. This preliminary list was not based solely on 21 CFR 320.33(c) which is contained in a section of the regulations related to criteria and evidence to assess actual or potential bioequivalence problems, nor does it accurately reflect the Agency\u2019s opinion on narrow therapeutic range drugs. Currently, the issue of narrow therapeutic range drugs is under discussion within CDER. If unsure about the classification of a drug as a narrow therapeutic range drug, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division.\n\nExamples:\n\nChange in the technical grade and/or specifications of the release controlling excipient(s).6 Footnote 6: Example: Eudragit RS-100 vs. Eudragit RL-100.\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation, greater than those listed above for a level 1 change, but less than or equal to 10% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the drug product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 10% w/w of the total release controlling excipient(s) in the original approved formulation. The total weight of the dosage form could still be within or outside the approved original application range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition are based on the original approved target composition and not on the composition based on previous level 1 or level 2 changes. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n* Test Documentation\n* Chemistry documentation Application/compential product release requirements and updated executed batch records.\n\nStability:\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs: One batch with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first production batch reported in annual report.\n\nNarrow therapeutic range drugs: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report.\n\nDissolution documentation\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs\n\nExtended release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained in three other media, for example, in water, 0.1N HCl, and USP buffer media at pH 4.5, and 6.8 for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, dissolution tests should be performed in 0.1 N HCl for 2 hours (acid stage) followed by testing in USP buffer media in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 (buffer stage) under standard (application/compendial) test conditions and two additional agitation speeds using the application/compendial test apparatus (three additional test conditions). If the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached.

The same principles described in the guidance might also apply to pre-approval changes. Additional considerations for the use of in vitro data in support of determining a drug's BA are described below.\n\nFootnote 56: 21 CFR 320.24(b)(6).\n\nFootnote 57: 21 CFR 320.24(b)(6).\n\nFootnote 58: 21 CFR 320.24(b)(6).\n\n.4.3.2 MR Formulations\n\nThe use of in vitro data could be acceptable for MR drug products with specific postapproval changes.56 Specific information on the use of in vitro data for postapproval changes to MR drug products is delineated in the FDA's guidance entitled SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (October 1997). The same principles described in the guidance might also apply to pre-approval changes. Additional considerations for the use of in vitro data in support of determining a drug's BA are described below.\n\nFootnote 57: 21 CFR 320.24(b)(6).\n\n.4.2.3 Beaded capsules\n\nPer 21 CFR 320.24(b)(6), in vivo BA studies for higher strengths of beaded capsules (e.g., a strength that is developed after initial BA studies of lower strengths) might not be necessary based on: (1) the clinical safety or efficacy data of the proposed dose and the need for the higher strength; (2) the linearity of the pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range; and (3) whether the same dissolution procedures were used for all strengths and yielded similar dissolution results. The f({}_{2}) similarity test can be used to demonstrate similar profiles among the different strengths of the product. The sponsor can determine the in vivo BA of one or more lower strengths by comparing the dissolution profiles and conducting an in vivo BA study only on the highest strength (unless safety reasons preclude the administration of the highest strength to subjects). The dissolution profiles for each strength should be generated using the recommended dissolution method. If the dissolution method has not been finalized, dissolution profiles should be generated in at least three media (e.g., pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8).\n\nb.   Other MR dosage forms\n\nFor other MR dosage forms, the sponsor should conduct an in vivo BA study using the highest strength. The sponsor can determine the BA for lower strengths by comparing the dissolution profiles using f({}{2}) evaluation when the drug product is in the same dosage form but in a different strength, and: (1) the drug exhibits linear pharmacokinetics; (2) the various strengths are proportionally similar in their active and inactive ingredients; and (3) the mechanism of release of the drug is the same.57 If the formulations of all the strengths are not compositionally proportional, in vitro data can be submitted for the middle strengths if the following data are acceptable: (1) BA or BE data, as appropriate, for both the highest and the lowest strengths; and (2) comparisons of in vitro multimedia dissolution profiles using f({}{2}) evaluation. Alternatively, waivers can be granted for lower strengths that are not proportional to the highest strength if a dissolution safe space has been established for the drug product via either IVIVCs or IVIVRs combined with virtual BE.58The dissolution profiles for each strength should be generated using the recommended dissolution method. If the dissolution method has not been finalized, dissolution profiles should be generated in at least three media (e.g., pH 1.2, pH 4.5, and pH 6.8). The dissolution profiles should be generated on the test and reference products of all strengths using the same dissolution test conditions.\n\nVI Special Topics\n\nEnantiomers Versus Racemates\n\nDuring the development of a racemic drug product, the racemate should be measured in BA studies using an achiral assay. It could also be important to measure the individual enantiomers of the racemate to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers. For the development of a specific enantiomer, chiral inversion should be assessed.\n\nMeasuring individual enantiomers in BA is recommended only when all the following conditions are met:\n\nThe enantiomers exhibit different PD characteristics\n\nThe enantiomers exhibit different PK characteristics\n\nPrimary efficacy and safety activities reside with the minor enantiomer\n\nAt least one of the enantiomers exhibits nonlinear absorption (as expressed by a change in the enantiomer concentration ratio with change in the input rate of the drug)\n\nIn such cases, the sponsor should apply BE criteria to the enantiomers separately.\n\nDrug Products With Complex Mixtures as the Active Ingredients\n\nCertain drug products can contain complex drug substances (i.e., active moieties or active ingredients that are mixtures of multiple synthetic or natural source components). The chemical structure or biological activity of some or all of the components of these complex drug substances might not be fully characterized. Quantification of all active or potentially active components in BA studies might not be possible. In such cases, sponsors should use a select number of components in BA studies. The criteria for selecting the components should typically include the amount of the moiety in the dosage form, the plasma or blood levels of the moiety, and the biological activity of the moiety. When PK approaches are not feasible to assess the rate and extent of absorption of a drug substance from a drug product, the sponsor can consider PD, clinical, or in vitro approaches.59 In such cases, sponsors should consult the appropriate review division on the approach and moieties for conducting BA studies.\n\nDrugs With Long Half-Lives\n\nIn a BA or a PK study involving an IR, oral product with a long half-life (i.e., greater than or equal to 24 hours), characterization of the product's half-life should include blood sampling over an adequate period of time. To determine the BA of a drug product containing a drug with a long half-life, a single-dose crossover study should be conducted if an adequate washout period is used. If the crossover study is problematic, a study with a parallel design should be used. For either a crossover or parallel study, the sample collection time should ensure that the drug product completely moves through the gastrointestinal tract so that the absorption of the drug substance (Cmax) and a suitably truncated AUC (i.e., for drugs that do not exhibit flip-flop kinetics and drugs that do not have high intra-subject variability) can be used to characterize the peak and total drug exposures, respectively. In these cases, the sponsor should consult the appropriate review division on the duration of sampling and the choice of the PK measures for determining BA.\n\nOrally Administered Drugs Intended for Local Action\n\nDetermining BA when the drug substance produces its effects by local action in the gastrointestinal tract can be achieved either by using pharmacokinetics, an acceptable PD endpoint, clinical efficacy and safety studies, or suitably designed and validated in vitro studies, as appropriate.60 In these cases, sponsors should consult the appropriate review division regarding the approach for assessing BA.\n\nFootnote 60: 21 CFR 320.24.\n\nAppendix E Combination and Co-administered Drug Products\n\nTwo or more active ingredients can be formulated as a single drug product, which is referred to for the purposes of this guidance document as a fixed combination product. Generally, the purpose of an in vivo BA study involving a fixed combination product is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of each active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety in the combination drug product to the rate and extent of absorption of each active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety administered concurrently as separate, single-ingredient preparations.61\n\nFootnote 61: 21 CFR 320.25(g).\n\nA two-arm, single-dose, crossover, fasted study of the fixed combination versus the single-ingredient drug products administered concurrently or an approved combination product containing the same active ingredients is recommended. This study should use the highest strength of the fixed combination with matching doses of the individual drug products. Certain alternative study designs could also be considered depending on the specific situation. For instance, when there are no drug interactions between the components of a fixed combination consisting of two components, a three-arm study design comparing the combination drug product versus the single-ingredient drug products administered separately could be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn addition, evaluation of the effect of a high-fat meal on the new drug product can be useful to support labeling of the fixed combination. A single-dose, high-fat, food-effect study design should be used.\n\nSponsors should consult with the appropriate review division to discuss their specific situation.\n\nBA studies for the fixed combination product should include the measurement of systemic concentrations of each active ingredient. The CI approach for BA assessment should be applied to each measured entity of the fixed combination and its reference product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Bioavailability Studies Submitted in NDAs or INDs \u2013 General Considerations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9722868204116821", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: A: No, since that would conflict with the agency's current bioequivalence policy. 5. Q: When a bio study is required under SUPAC-IR, to what product should a generic product be compared - the Reference Listed Drug or the generic product approved prior to the SUPAC change.\n\nA: An innovator product should be compared to itself. A generic should be compared to the reference listed drug for that drug product.\n\nStability/change in batch size\n\nQ: When the documentation for a change is one batch on long term stability, is there a time limit between implementation of the change and initiation of the stability study?A: No. But the stability study should start as soon as possible after the drug product is prepared in the market container.2. Q: What is the stability requirement for a level 3 change involving a product with multiple strengths packaged in bottles and blisters? SUPAC-IR states one batch. Can we bracket?A: Testing and data collection involving the use of product bracketing are not the subject of SUPAC-IR. Bracketing may be used with prior approval of the Agency. The amount of data required depends on the type of change and whether or not there is a significant body of data available. If an applicant plans to bracket, the proposed protocol should be submitted to the Agency. This plan should include a protocol for each product. It should indicate all of the approved packaging configurations, and what strengths are approved for each of these. It also should include the approved stability test protocol.3. Q: Who determines how many batches are required for stability when the documentation requests 1-3?A: The answer will be dependent on the specific drug product and the amount of data already available. The appropriate review division should be contacted for further guidance.4. Q: When accelerated stability data are required, is that comparative data?\n\nA: Yes. Historical data may be used for comparison.\n\n7 Miscellaneous Issues\n\nQ: The recommended documentation for several SUPAC-IR changes indicates that \"batch records\" or \"updated batch records\" be submitted. Should copies of batch records be submitted with the appropriate filing? Is batch record defined as the actual blank floor work order or can another manufacturing process description be used? In which cases should the batch records be executed batch records?A: Wherever \"batch record\" occurs in the SUPAC-IR guidance, it means executed batch records. These records should be submitted in the designated filing.2. Q: What does the Agency intend by \"notification of change\"? Should there be a separate communication to the Agency in addition to the annual report?A: The Agency should be notified of changes by the appropriate submission as described in the guidance..3. Q: May a firm make a SUPAC-IR change immediately after approval of the original application, or is there a waiting period?A: There is no waiting period. SUPAC-IR changes may be made as soon as the application is approved provided the appropriate data are available and filing criteria are addressed.4. Q: When there is a time lag between when changes are made under SUPAC and the submission of the annual report, what evidence is needed to show that an appropriate change will be submitted in the next annual report? What will the FDA investigator expect to see?A: The regulations at 21 CFR 314.70 (d) govern the filing of annual reports. Changes are made according to the applicant's change policy/procedures; these are part of the cGMP requirements. Because all changes should be approved by the appropriate quality unit, some set of documentation (e.g., development protocols, validation runs, batch records, etc.) should exist before the change is made. The investigator would expect to see this documentation.5. Q: Should the information described under \"documentation\" be submitted in the filing, or does having the appropriate information on site for the inspection satisfy the requirement?A: The documentation should be included in the designated filing regardless of whether a supplement (prior approval or changes being effected) or annual report is used.6. Q: Are changes such as tablet shape and size covered under SUPAC-IR?A: In general, changes involving size and/or geometry of the tablet are not covered under SUPAC-IR, and would need prior approval supplements.\n\nHowever, changes in thickness due to a composition change may be covered under SUPAC-IR 7. Q: What does the Center expect relative to validation for SUPAC-IR changes?A: A summary of the validation data should be included in submissions describing process changes.8. Q: What is meant by \"validated range\"?A: Validated ranges mean the upper and lower limits are validated for a particular manufacturing process. An example of this is the time required during mixing of bulk powders which supports the minimum and maximum time needed to optimize mixing of the contents9. Q: Based on the SUPAC video, it appears that a certificate of analysis and dissolution data need not be submitted in annual reports, but should be held on site. Is this correct?A: These data should be submitted in the annual report.10. Q: A \"significant body of data\" is mentioned in several places in the SUPAC-IR guidance. What does this mean?A: If an applicant for a new molecular entity has at least five years of post-approval manufacturing experience, or if the applicant for a new dosage that is an immediate release solid oral, has at least three years of post-approval manufacturing experience, the Center believes that a \"significant body of information\" exists for that product.11. Q: In the SUPAC-IR guidance document, what is meant by a \"short period of time\"?A: Because it is difficult to specify a single time frame which could be applied to all situations for drug products, the appropriate chemistry team leader should be consulted. Each situation will be defined on a case by case basis.12. Q: If a new dosage form of a product that has been marketed for a number of years is accepted for filing as a generic product through the suitability petition process, will it be considered to have a \"significant body of information\"?A: No, it would not. As noted in the definition for significant body of information, a significant body of information is likely to exist after three years of commercial experience for new dosage forms.\n\nDate created: February 19, 1997; last update: July 6, 2005\n\n1.3 Submit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Petitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[0.5cm] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.7272157669067383", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: All changes in the scale of the nonprotein drug product manufacturing batches can be reported in an annual report (see section VII.D.1.a).4 However, if the scale change results in other changes (e.g., equipment, process), the change would be considered a multiple change, and the recommended reporting category should be the most restrictive of those for any of the individual changes (section XII). Recommendations on scale changes for protein drug products are included in section VII.C.1.c and VII.D.1.a of the guidance. Footnote 4: The reporting categories in the Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA guidance supersede those recommended in SUPAC guidances where there are inconsistencies. Therefore, the recommendations in SUPAC-IR that certain scale changes be submitted in supplements are superseded.\n\nSPECifications\n\nQ1: How should a revision of an analytical procedure be reported to allow for the use of a company (i.e., secondary) standard in addition to the U. S. Pharmacopeia (USP) standard?\n\nA1: The revision of an analytical procedure to allow the option to use a secondary standard should be reported in an annual report. Also, the laboratory reference standards used must comply with CGMP regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 211.194(c)). Q2: How should a decrease in the fill volume be reported?\n\nA2: A change in the fill volume of a drug product involves a change to the specification and must be submitted in a prior approval supplement unless exempted by regulation or guidance (506A(c)(2)(A) of the Act). There is no exemption for this type of specification change; therefore, a prior approval supplement should be submitted. Q3: What reporting category should be used if a USP HPLC assay procedure replaces, or is used in addition to, a microbiological assay that is listed in the approved specification as the regulatory analytical procedure?\n\nA3: The addition of the HPLC analytical procedure to comply with an official compendium can be submitted in an annual report (section VIII.D.1). However, if the microbiological assay will also be deleted, the deletion of a test should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VIII.B.2 and 3). Q4: In the approved application, it is specified that full product testing will be performed before bulk material is sent to a contract package and when the packaged material is received from the contractor. Can notification in an annual report be used to replace the full testing of the product after it is received from the contractor with an identity test?\n\nA4: This change involves a deletion of tests and should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VIII.B.2).\n\nPACKAGE\n\nQ1: The plastic used in a desiccant canister is being changed. When the desiccant is used for bottles of solid oral dosage form products, should it be reported as a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section IX.C.2.b of the guidance?\n\nMiscellaneous Changes\n\nThe guidance recommends an annual report for the addition of time points to the stability protocol or deletion of time points beyond the approved expiration dating period. If these changes are made in an annual report, is the protocol still considered approved?\n\nYes. If changes such as these are made in an annual report, the stability protocol is still considered approved.\n\nHow should the addition of a test to an approved stability protocol be reported?\n\nWhen a test is added, whether it is added to a release specification or a stability protocol, the change should be reported in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section VIII.C.2.a of the guidance, which states \"An addition to a specification that provides increased assurance that the drug substance or drug product will have the characteristics of identity, strength, purity, or potency that it purports or is represented to possess.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe objective of this document is to provide guidance to other Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to state and local governments regarding the safe and effective use of potassium iodide (KI) as an adjunct to other public health protective measures in the event that radioactive iodine is released into the environment. The adoption and implementation of these recommendations are at the discretion of the state and local governments responsible for developing regional emergency-response plans related to radiation emergencies.\n\nThis guidance updates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1982 recommendations for the use of KI to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies involving the release of radioactive iodine. The recommendations in this guidance address KI dosage and the projected radiation exposure at which the drug should be used.\n\nThese recommendations were prepared by the Potassium Iodide Working Group, comprising scientists from the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in collaboration with experts in the field from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although they differ in two respects (as discussed in Section IV.2), these revised recommendations are in general accordance with those of the World Health Organization (WHO), as expressed in its Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis Following Nuclear Accidents: Update 1999 (WHO 1999).\n\nII Background\n\nUnder 44 CFR 351, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established roles and responsibilities for Federal agencies in assisting state and local governments in their radiological emergency planning and preparedness activities. The Federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), are to carry out these roles and responsibilities as members of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee(FRPCC). Under 44 CFR 351.23(f), HHS is directed to provide guidance to state and local governments on the use of radioprotective substances and the prophylactic use of drugs (e.g., KI) to reduce the radiation dose to specific organs. This guidance includes information about dosage and projected radiation exposures at which such drugs should be used.\n\nThe FDA has provided guidance previously on the use of KI as a thyroid blocking agent. In the Federal Register of December 15, 1978, FDA announced its conclusion that KI is a safe and effective means by which to block uptake of radioiodines by the thyroid gland in a radiation emergency under certain specified conditions of use. In the Federal Register of June 29, 1982, FDA announced final recommendations on the administration of KI to the general public in a radiation emergency. Those recommendations were formulated after reviewing studies relating radiation dose to thyroid disease risk that relied on estimates of external thyroid irradiation after the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and analogous studies among children who received therapeutic radiation to the head and neck. Those recommendations concluded that at a projected dose to the thyroid gland of 25 cGy or greater from ingested or inhaled radioiodines, the risks of short-term use of small quantities of KI were outweighed by the benefits of suppressing radioiodine-induced thyroid cancer.1 The amount of KI recommended at that time was 130 mg per day for adults and children above 1 year of age and 65 mg per day for children below 1 year of age. The guidance that follows revises our 1982 recommendations on the use of KI for thyroid cancer prophylaxis based on a comprehensive review of the data relating radioioidine exposure to thyroid cancer risk accumulated in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident.\n\nFootnote 1: For the radiation emitted by ({}^{131}) I (electrons and photons), the radiation-weighting factor is equal to one, so that the absorbed dose to the thyroid gland expressed in centigrays (cGy) is numerically equal to the thyroid equivalent dose expressed in rem (1 cGy = 1 rem).\n\n3 Data Sources\n\nReliance on Data from Chernobyl\n\nIn epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between thyroidal radioiodine exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, the estimation of thyroid radiation doses is a critical and complex aspect of the analyses. Estimates of exposure, both for individuals and across populations, have been reached in different studies by the variable combination of (1) direct thyroid measurements in a segment of the exposed population; (2) measurements of ({}^{131})I (iodine isotope) concentrations in the milk consumed by different groups (e.g., communities) and of the quantity of milk consumed; (3) inference from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes released coincidentally and presumably in fixed ratios with radioiodines; and (4) reconstruction of the nature and extent of the actual radiation release.\n\nAll estimates of individual and population exposure contain some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty is least for estimates of individual exposure based on direct thyroid measurements.\n\nUncertainty increases with reliance on milk consumption estimates; is still greater with estimates derived from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes, and is highest for estimates that rely heavily on release reconstruction.\n\nDirect measurements of thyroid radioactivity are unavailable from the Hanford, Nevada Test Site, and Marshall Islands exposures. Indeed, the estimates of thyroid radiation doses related to these releases rely heavily on release reconstructions and, in the former two cases, on recall of the extent of milk consumption 40 to 50 years after the fact. In the Marshall Islands cohort, urinary radioiodine excretion data were obtained and used in calculating exposure estimates.\n\nBecause of the great uncertainty in the dose estimates from the Hanford and Nevada Test Site exposures and due to the small numbers of thyroid cancers occurring in the populations potentially exposed, the epidemiological studies of the excess thyroid cancer risk related to these radioiodine releases are, at best, inconclusive. As explained below, the dosimetric data derived in the studies of individual and population exposures following the Chernobyl accident, although not perfect, are unquestionably superior to data from previous releases. In addition, the results of the earlier studies are inadequate to refute cogent case control study evidence from Chernobyl of a cause-effect relationship between thyroid radioiodine deposition and thyroid cancer risk.2\n\nFootnote 2: We have included in this guidance an extensive bibliography of the sources used in developing these revised recommendations.\n\nThe Chernobyl reactor accident of April 1986 provides the best-documented example of a massive radionuclide release in which large numbers of people across a broad geographical area were exposed acutely to radioiodines released into the atmosphere. Therefore, the recommendations contained in this guidance are derived from our review of the Chernobyl data as they pertain to the large number of thyroid cancers that occurred. These are the most comprehensive and reliable data available describing the relationship between thyroid radiation dose and risk for thyroid cancer following an environmental release of ({}^{131})I. In contrast, the exposures resulting from radiation releases at the Hanford Site in Washington State in the mid-1940s and in association with the nuclear detonations at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s were extended over years, rather than days to weeks, contributing to the difficulty in estimating radioactive dose in those potentially exposed (Davis et al., 1999; Gilbert et al., 1998). The exposure of Marshall Islanders to fallout from the nuclear detonation on Bikini in 1954 involved relatively few people, and although the high rate of subsequent thyroid nodules and cancers in the exposed population was likely caused in large part by radioiodines, the Marshall Islands data provide little insight into the dose-response relationship between radioactive iodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk (Robbins and Adams 1989).\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.926231861114502", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: The FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to note that among 7 million adults who took stable iodine in Poland following Chernobyl, only two severe adverse reactions were reported, both in persons with known allergy to iodine. Based on these data, we have concluded that even if the risks associated with excess stable iodine are greater in adults than in children, the risk of serious adverse reactions overall is exceedingly small.\n\nIn summary, FDA understands that a KI administration program that sets different projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for treatment of different population groups may be logistically impractical to implement during a radiological emergency. If emergency planners reach this conclusion, FDA recommends that KI be administered to both children and adults at the lowest intervention threshold (i.e., (\\geq 5) cGy projected internal thyroid exposure in children).\n\nAs a rule, however, individuals with known allergy to KI or with pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) that might predispose them to adverse reactions should avoid KI. Most likely these will be adults, who have little or no risk of developing thyroid cancer from radioactive exposure to the thyroid and who may, in these cases, incur substantial risks from taking KI.\n\nQ8: Does the FDA guidance apply to residents outside of the 10-mile emergency planning zone for nuclear poset plants?\n\nYes. KI administered in advance of an exposure will successfully block thyroidal uptake of radioiodine, wherever one may reside.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.541451454162598", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: For optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n\nFDA maintains that KI is a safe and effective means by which to prevent radioiodine uptake by the thyroid gland, under certain specified conditions of use, and thereby obviate the risk of thyroid cancer in the event of a radiation emergency. Based upon review of the literature, we have proposed lower radioactive exposure thresholds for KI prophylaxis as well as lower doses of KI for neonates, infants, and children than we recommended in 1982. As in our 1982 notice in the Federal Register, FDA continues to recommend that radiation emergency response plans include provisions, in the event of a radiation emergency, for informing the public about the magnitude of the radiation hazard, about the manner of use of KI and its potential benefits and risks, and for medical contact, reporting, and assistance systems. FDA also emphasizes that emergency response plans and any systems for ensuring availability of KI to the public should recognize the critical importance of KI administration in advance of exposure to radioiodine. As in the past, FDA continues to work in an ongoing fashion with manufacturers of KI to ensure that high-quality, safe, and effective KI products are available for purchase by consumers as well as by state and local governments wishing to establish stores for emergency distribution.\n\nKI provides protection only for the thyroid from radioiodines. It has no impact on the uptake by the body of other radioactive materials and provides no protection against external irradiation of any kind. FDA emphasizes that the use of KI should be as an adjunct to evacuation (itself not always feasible), sheltering, and control of foodstuffs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe KI Taskforce would like to extend special thanks to our members from the NIH: Jacob Robbins, M.D., and Jan Wolff, Ph.D., M.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases and Andre Bouville, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides answers to questions that FDA has received as state and local governments develop emergency response plans involving the use of potassium iodide (KI) to protect against the effects of radioactive iodine accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere. KI is recommended for use as an adjunct to other emergency measures, such as evacuation and control of the food supply to avoid ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. When used correctly, KI can prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. KI provides optimal protection when administered immediately prior to or in conjunction with passage of a radioactive cloud. The incorporation of KI into radiation emergency response plans is at the discretion of state and local governments.\n\nThis is a revision of the question and answer guidance published in April 2002. The revision incorporates two additional questions (question 4 and question 7) raised about KI intervention and makes minor editorial changes to the previous questions and answers.\n\nII Background\n\nIn a guidance entitled Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies (December 2001), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its 1982 recommendations for the safe and effective use of KI to prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. The current recommendations are based on conclusions reached after reviewing data on radioiodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk gathered after the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986. The data suggest that the risk of thyroid cancer is inversely related to age. Fetuses, infants, and young children are at greatest risk and may be harmed by small amounts of radioiodine.\n\nAlthough special precautions should be taken when administering KI to pregnant women and newborns within the first month of life (adherence to the recommended dose, avoidance of repeat dosing, and monitoring of thyroid function in neonates), the benefits of short-term administration of KI as a thyroid blocking agent far exceed the risks of administration to any age group. For complete information, please refer to FDA's December 2001 guidance.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1:: Does FDA have specific recommendations about radiation emergency preparedness plans and the use of KI?\n\nNo. Decisions about the details of their preparedness plans are up to state and local authorities. FDA's guidance provides general recommendations about the use of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiological emergency. These recommendations are discussed in Section V. of the guidance.\n\nQ2:: Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n\nNo. FDA has made recommendations on the lowest effective dose. Higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg) would be equally effective and, particularly among school-age children, extremely safe (see also question 9).\n\nQ3:: If a graded dosing approach is considered, how does FDA suggest that fractional doses (i.e., 65, 32, 16 mg) be administered?\n\nKI tablets can be dissolved in liquids and the appropriate volume administered. For example, if a 130 mg tablet were dissolved in 8 ounces of liquid, one ounce would contain about 16 mg of KI. FDA has conducted studies of the palatability, solubility, and stability of KI dissolved in a number of different liquids, including juice and formula. (See the Home Preparation Procedure for Emergency Administration of Potassium Iodide Tablets to Infants and Small Children.2) Emergency planners and others should understand that absolute precision in dosing is generally not critical to safety or efficacy (see also question 4).\n\nFootnote 2: This is available at http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/default.htm.\n\nQ4.: FDA guidance recommends graded dosing by age, with neonates receiving the lowest dose (16 mg daily) and adults receiving the highest (130 mg). FDA approved KI tablets are available in two dosage strengths: 65 and 130 mg. At a minimum, dosing based on FDA guidance would require either splitting tablets or dissolving tablets in liquids. This may be impractical while responding to a radiological emergency. In this context, what is the impact of uniform dosing across all age groups eligible for KI prophylaxis?* The FDA's guidance on dosing KI in radiation emergencies adheres to principles of minimum effective dose and therefore recommends graded dosing according to age (and thus, in effect, body size). There is ample evidence that the recommended doses, as well as higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg), will effectively block thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine if taken in advance of exposure. Furthermore, particularly among school-age children, higher milligram doses are extremely safe. We also realize that a scheme of graded dosing may be difficult to implement during a radiological emergency involving large numbers of people. However, we continue to emphasize attention to KI dosing in infants. Excess iodine intake can lead to transient iodine-induced hypothyroidism. As we have said in our guidance, individuals who are intolerant of KI at protective doses, as well as neonates, pregnant, and lactating women, should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nIn summary, if local emergency planners conclude that graded dosing is logistically impractical, FDA believes that for populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of taking up to 130 mg of KI instead of the lower doses recommended for certain age groups far exceed the small risks of overdosing. However, where feasible, adherence to FDA guidance should be attempted when dosing infants.\n\nWill dosage strengths of KI below 130 mg be available in the United States?\n\nYes. An FDA approved 65-mg KI tablet is being marketed now in the United States.\n\nAre there plans to update the labeling for marketed KI products to conform to the revised FDA recommendations on dosing?\n\nYes. FDA is working with manufacturers to amend the \"Drug Facts\" labeling for KI products, which are sold over the counter, to incorporate the new dosing recommendations.\n\nHow critical to public health is adherence to FDA's recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category? Specifically, the existence of different thresholds for neonates, children through age 18, and pregnant or lactating women ((\\geq) 5 cGy) versus adults aged 18 through 40 years ((\\geq) 10 cGy) versus adults over age 40 ((\\geq) 500 cGy) are confusing and logistically complex to follow in responding to a radiological emergency.\n\nThe FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.21391205489635468", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Thyroidal side effects of stable iodine include iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, which is more common in older people and in iodine deficient areas but usually requires repeated doses of stable iodine. In addition, iodide goiter and hypothyroidism are potential side effects more common in iodine sufficient areas, but they require chronic high doses of stable iodine (Rubery 1990). In light of the preceding, individuals with multinodular goiter, Graves' disease, and autoimmune thyroiditis should be treated with caution, especially if dosing extends beyond a few days. The vast majority of such individuals will be adults.\n\nThe transient hypothyroidism observed in 0.37 percent (12 of 3214) of neonates treated with KI in Poland after Chernobyl has been without reported sequelae to date. There is no question that the benefits of KI treatment to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer outweigh the risks of such treatment in neonates. Nevertheless, in light of the potential consequences of even transient hypothyroidism for intellectual development, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for this effect by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calaciura 1995).\n\nAppendix B KI Use in Radiation Emergencies: Treatment Recommendations\n\nAfter careful review of the data from Chernobyl relating estimated thyroid radiation dose and cancer risk in exposed children, FDA is revising its recommendation for administration of KI based on age, predicted thyroid exposure, and pregnancy and lactation status (see Table).\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Threshold Thyroid Radioactive Exposures and} \\ \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Recommended Doses of KI for Different Risk Groups} \\ \\hline  & Predicted & KI dose (mg) & # of 130 mg & # of 65 \\  & Thyroid & tablets & mg tablets \\  & exposure(cGy) & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 40 yrs & (>)500 & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 18 through 40 yrs & (>)10 & & & \\ \\hline Pregnant or lactating women & & 130 & 1 & 2 \\ \\hline Adoles. over 12 through 18 yrs & (\\geq) 5 & & & \\ \\hline Children over 3 through 12 yrs & & 65 & 1/2 & 1 \\ \\hline Over 1 month through 3 years & & 32 & 1/4 & 1/2 \\ \\hline Birth through 1 month & & 16 & 1/8 & 1/4 \\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Adolescents approaching adult size ((\\geq) 70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg).} \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nThe protective effect of KI lasts approximately 24 hours. For optimal prophylaxis, KI should therefore be dosed daily, until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodines by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists. Individuals intolerant of KI at protective doses, and neonates, pregnant and lactating women (in whom repeat administration of KI raises particular safety issues, see below) should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nNote that adults over 40 need take KI only in the case of a projected large internal radiation dose to the thyroid ((>)500 cGy) to prevent hypothyroidism.\n\nThese recommendations are meant to provide states and local authorities as well as other agencies with the best current guidance on safe and effective use of KI to reduce thyroidal radioiodine exposure and thus the risk of thyroid cancer. FDA recognizes that, in the event of an emergency, some or all of the specific dosing recommendations may be very difficult to carry out given their complexity and the logistics of implementation of a program of KI distribution. The recommendations should therefore be interpreted with flexibility as necessary to allow optimally effective and safe dosing given the exigencies of any particular emergency situation. In this context, we offer the following critical general guidance: across populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of KI far exceed the risks of overdosing, especially in children, though we continue to emphasize particular attention to dose in infants.\n\nThese FDA recommendations differ from those put forward in the World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 guidelines for iodine prophylaxis in two ways. WHO recommends a 130-mg dose of KI for adults and adolescents (over 12 years). For the sake of logistical simplicity in the dispensing and administration of KI to children, FDA recommends a 65-mg dose as standard for all school-age children while allowing for the adult dose (130 mg, 2 X 65 mg tablets) in adolescents approaching adult size. The other difference lies in the threshold for predicted exposure of those up to 18 years of age and of pregnant or lactating women that should trigger KI prophylaxis. WHO recommends a threshold of 1 cGy for these two groups. As stated earlier, FDA has concluded from the Chernobyl data that the most reliable evidence supports a significant increase in the risk of childhood thyroid cancer at exposures of 5 cGy or greater.\n\nThe downward KI dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65 mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., (>)70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16 mg) of KI. Repeat dosing of KI should be avoided in the neonate to minimize the risk of hypothyroidism during that critical phase of brain development (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995). KI from tablets (either whole or fractions) or as fresh saturated KI solution may be diluted in milk, formula, or water and the appropriate volume administered to babies. As stated above, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for the potential development of hypothyroidism by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995).\n\nPregnant women should be given KI for their own protection and for that of the fetus, as iodine (whether stable or radioactive) readily crosses the placenta. However, because of the risk of blocking fetal thyroid function with excess stable iodine, repeat dosing with KI of pregnant women should be avoided. Lactating females should be administered KI for their own protection, as for other young adults, and potentially to reduce the radioiodine content of the breast milk, but not as a means to deliver KI to infants, who should get their KI directly. As for direct administration of KI, stable iodine as a component of breast milk may also pose a risk of hypothyroidism in nursing neonates. Therefore, repeat dosing with KI should be avoided in the lactating mother, except during continuing severe contamination. If repeat dosing of the mother is necessary, the nursing neonate should be monitored as recommended above.\n\nAdditional Considerations in Prophylaxis against Thyroid Radioidoline Exposure\n\nCertain principles should guide emergency planning and implementation of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiation emergency. After the Chernobyl accident, across the affected populations, thyroid radiation exposures occurred largely due to consumption of contaminated fresh cow's milk (this contamination was the result of milk cows grazing on fields affected by radioactive fallout) and to a much lesser extent by consumption of contaminated vegetables. In this or similar accidents, for those residing in the immediate area of the accident or otherwise directly exposed to the radioactive plume, inhalation of radioiodines may be a significant contributor to individual and population exposures. As a practical matter, it may not be possible to assess the risk of thyroid exposure from inhaled radioiodines at the time of the emergency. The risk depends on factors such as the magnitude and rate of the radioiodine release, wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, and thus may affect people both near to and far from the accident site.\n\nFor optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.1134946346282959", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Other specific features of the design may also deserve discussion, including presence or absence of washout periods and the duration of the treatment period, especially for a chronic illness. The rationale for dose and dose-interval selection should be explained, if it is not obvious. For example, once daily dosing with a short half-life drug whose effect is closely related in time to blood level is not usually effective; if the study design uses such dosing, this should be explained, e.g., by pointing to pharmacodynamic evidence that effect is prolonged compared to blood levels. The procedures used to seek evidence of \"escape\" from drug effect at the end of the dose-interval, such as measurements of effect just before dosing, should be described. Similarly, in a parallel design dose-response study, the choice of doses should be explained.\n\nSelection of Study Population\n\n9.3.1 Inclusion Criteria\n\nThe patient population and the selection criteria used to enter the patients into the study should be described, and the suitability of the population for the purposes of the study discussed. Specific diagnostic criteria used, as well as specific disease(e.g., disease of a particular severity or duration, results of a particular test or rating scale(s) or physical examination, particular features of clinical history, such as failure or success on prior therapy, or other potential prognostic factors and any age, sex, or ethnic factors) should be presented.\n\nScreening criteria and any additional criteria for randomization or entry into the test drug/investigational product treatment part of the trial should be described. If there is reason to believe that there were additional entry criteria, not defined in the protocol, the implications of these should be discussed. For example, some investigators may have excluded or entered into other studies patients who were particularly ill or who had particular baseline characteristics.\n\n9.3.2 Exclusion Criteria\n\nThe criteria for exclusion at entry into the study should be specified and the rationale provided (e.g., safety concerns, administrative reasons, or lack of suitability for the trial). The impact of exclusions on the generalizability of the study should be discussed in section 13 of the study report or in an overview of safety and efficacy.\n\n9.3.3 Removal of Patients From Therapy or Assessment\n\nThe predetermined reasons for removing patients from therapy or assessment observation, if any, should be described, as should the nature and duration of any planned followup observations in those patients.\n\n9.4 Treatments\n\n9.4.1 Treatments Administered\n\nThe precise treatments or diagnostic agents to be administered in each arm of the study, and for each period of the study, should be described including route and mode of administration, dose, and dosage schedule.\n\n9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products(s)\n\nIn the text of the report, a brief description of the test drug(s)/investigational product(s) (formulation, strength, batch number(s)) should be given. If more than one batch of test drug/investigational product was used, patients receiving each batch should be identified in Appendix 16.1.6.\n\nThe source of placebos and active control/comparator product(s) should be provided. Any modification of comparator product(s) from their usual commercial state should be noted, and the steps taken to assure that their bioavailability was unaltered should be described.\n\nFor long-duration trials of investigational products with limited shelf-lives or incomplete stability data, the logistics of resupply of the materials should be described. Any use of test materials past their expiry date should be noted, and patients receiving them identified. If there were specific storage requirements, these should also be described.\n\n9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups\n\nThe specific methods used to assign patients to treatment groups, e.g., centralized allocation, allocation within sites, adaptive allocation (that is, assignment on the basis of earlier assignment or outcome) should be described in the text of the report, including any stratification or blocking procedures. Any unusual features should be explained.\n\nA detailed description of the randomization method, including how it was executed, should be given in Appendix 16.1.7 with references cited if necessary. A table exhibiting the randomization codes, patient identifier, and treatment assigned should also be presented in the Appendix. For a multicenter study, the information should be given by center. The method of generating random numbers should be explained.\n\nFor a historically controlled trial, it is important to explain how the particul ar control was selected and what other historical experiences were examined, if any, and how their results compared to the control used.\n\n9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study\n\nThe doses or dose ranges used in the study should be given for all treatments and the basis for choosing them described (e.g., prior experience in humans, animal data).\n\n9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient\n\nProcedures for selecting each patient's dose of test drug/ investigational product and active control/comparator should be described. These procedures can vary from simple random assignment to a selected fixed drug/dose regimen, to use of a specified titration procedure, or to more elaborate response-determined selection procedures, e.g., where dose is titrated upward at intervals until intolerance or some specified endpoint is achieved. Procedures for back-titration, if any, should also be described.\n\nThe timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and the relation of dosing to meals should be described and, if timing was not specified, this should be noted.\n\nAny specific instructions to patients about when or how to take the dose(s) should be described.\n\n9.4.6 Blinding\n\nA description of the specific procedures used to carry out blinding should be provided (e.g., how bottles were labeled, use of labels that reveal blind-breakage, sealed code list/envelopes, double dummy techniques), including the circumstances in which the blind would be broken for an individual or for all patients (e.g., for serious adverse events), the procedures used to do this, and who had access to patient codes. If the study allowed for some investigators to remain unblinded (e.g., to allow them to adjust medication), the means of shielding other investigators should be explained. Measures taken to ensure that test drug/investigational product and placebo were indistinguishable and evidence that they were indistinguishable should be described, as should the appearance, shape, smell, and taste of the test material. Measures to prevent unblinding by laboratory measurements, if used, should be described. If there was a data monitoring committee with access to unblinded data, procedures to ensure maintenance of overall study blinding should be described. The procedure used to maintain the blinding when interim analyses were performed should also be explained.\n\nIf blinding was considered unnecessary to reduce bias for some or all of the observations, this should be explained; e.g., use of a random-zero sphygmomanometer eliminates possible observer bias in reading blood pressure and Holter tapes are often read by automated systems that are presumably immune to observer bias. If blinding was considered desirable but not feasible, the reasons and implications should be discussed. Sometimes blinding is attempted but is known to be imperfect because of obvious drug effects in at least some patients (dry mouth, bradycardia, fever, injection site reactions, changes in laboratory data). Such problems or potential problems should be identified and, if there were any attempts to assess the magnitude of the problem or manage it (e.g., by having endpoint measurements carried out by people shielded from information that might reveal treatment assignment), they should be described.\n\n9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy\n\nWhich drugs or procedures were allowed before and during the study, whether and how their use was recorded, and any other specific rules and procedures related to permitted or prohibited concomitant therapy should be described. How allowed concomitant therapy might affect the outcome due either to drug-drug interaction or to direct effects on the study endpoints should be discussed, and how the independent effects of concomitant and study therapies could be ascertained should be explained.\n\n9.4.8 Treatment Compliance\n\nThe measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance should be described, e.g., drug accountability, diary cards, blood, urine or other body fluid drug level measurements, or medication event monitoring.\n\nEfficacy and Safety Variables\n\n9.5.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart\n\nThe specific efficacy and safety variables to be assessed and laboratory tests to be conducted, their schedule (days of study, time of day, relation to meals, and the timing of critical measures in relation to test drug administration, e.g., just prior to next dose, 2 hours after dose), the methods for measuring them, and the persons responsible for the measurements should be described. If there were changes in personnel carrying out critical measurements, these should be reported.\n\nIt is usually helpful to display graphically in a flow chart (see Annex III of the guideline) the frequency and timing of efficacy and safety measurements; visit numbers and times should be shown, or, alternatively, times alone can be used (visit numbers alone are more difficult to interpret).

The FDA does not consider the resulting digital image to be an exact copy of the glass slide. A whole slide image used in a GLP-compliant study should include all the elements from the glass slide that are needed for histopathological examination or pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 4: Digital images comprise a sequence of small images (referred to as tiles) taken from distinct locations on the glass slide. Whole slide imaging systems typically determine the optimal focal plane at a limited, discrete set of locations on the glass slide and interpolate the optimal focal plane to generate all of the tiles. The individual tiles are then combined to create the \u201cwhole slide\u201d image.\n\nQ2: Should whole slide images be retained?\n\nA2: For GLP-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies, if whole slide images are assessed in lieu of the original glass slides and result in the generation of pathology raw data, the whole slide image files should be retained as study records and archived. Consideration should be given to ensure that archived digital images remain viewable as software/hardware updates/versions are implemented.\n\nQ3: If the whole slide image files are retained, should the glass slides also be retained?\n\nA3: Yes. The glass slides contain study specimens and must be retained as study specimens after study finalization in accordance with 21 CFR part 58.\n\nQ4: What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?\n\nA4: The whole slide image files provided to the study pathologist for histopathological examination and/or provided to the peer review pathologist(s) for pathology peer review (i.e., files containing all image data captured by the scanner and documentation of any technical image processing modifications), referred to here as the original whole slide image files, should be retained if they are used to generate raw data. Specifically, any technical image processing modifications made to whole slide image files prior to being provided to the pathologist (e.g., smoothing, color manipulation) should be documented and retained. Technical image processing should not obscure elements captured from the glass slide (e.g., label, artifact).\n\nThe pathologist should not permanently alter the original whole slide image files. Nonpermanent adjustments made by the pathologist using the image viewing software during whole slide image evaluation (e.g., brightness, contrast, annotations) do not need to be documented or retained.\n\nQ5: Should written procedures for whole slide imaging processes be in place?\n\nA5: Yes, written procedures for whole slide imaging processes should be in place because whole slide images may be used to generate raw data. These processes may include, for example, training, slide scanning, software management, and file access and exchange control.\n\nQ6: Should the whole slide imaging system be validated?\n\nA6: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, the whole slide imaging system (including software and hardware) should be validated in a manner specific to the intended use of the technology.\n\nQ7: Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n\nA7: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, they should be protected to prevent loss or alteration of data, maintain chain of custody, control access, and secure data systems and data transmission. These measures should be performed following written procedures and processes in compliance with electronic record requirements under 21 CFR part 11 to maintain whole slide image file integrity.\n\nQ8: Should the signed pathology report/peer review statement state that whole slide images were evaluated in lieu of glass slides?\n\nA8: Yes, the signed pathology report should state whether glass slides or whole slide images were used for histopathological evaluation by the study pathologist, consistent with 21 CFR 58.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nuidance for Industry Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies: Questions and Answers (December 2021).

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides information to sponsors and nonclinical laboratories regarding the use and management of whole slide images used during histopathology assessment and/or pathology peer review performed for good laboratory practice (GLP)-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies using non-human specimens.2 The guidance does not cover the use of whole slide imaging for clinical applications. When whole slide imaging is used as part of a nonclinical study conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations (21 CFR part 58), adequate documentation is critical. The FDA's expectations regarding documentation practices during generation, use, and retention of whole slide images have not been clearly defined and vary among nonclinical testing facilities. This question-and-answer document is intended to clarify FDA's recommendations concerning the management, documentation, and use of whole slide imaging in histopathology assessment and/or pathology peer review for nonclinical studies conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations.\n\nFootnote 2: We support the principles of the \u201c3Rs,\u201d to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe histopathological assessment of tissue samples is one of the key activities conducted during GLP-compliant nonclinical laboratory studies. Commonly, the histopathological assessment includes an initial evaluation of glass histology slides3 by the study pathologist and a subsequent review (referred to as pathology peer review) by a second pathologist, group of pathologists, or Pathology Working Group. When whole slide imaging is used as part of a nonclinical study conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations, the management, documentation, and use of whole slide images in histopathology assessment and/or pathology peer review should be clear and follow written processes and procedures.\n\nFootnote 3: In the context of this guidance, the term histology slide refers to tissue mounted on a microscope slide, including organ sections and cell samples such as bone marrow and other cytological preparations.\n\nUse of whole slide images in casual consultations, opinion exchanges, and/or mentoring among pathologists is not covered by this guidance document.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What is whole slide imaging?\n\nA1: Whole slide imaging includes the software and hardware used to generate a two-dimensional digital image4 of a glass histology slide used for routine assessment in generation of the pathology report. The process includes four sequential parts: image acquisition (scanning), image processing, image file storage, and display of images. The FDA does not consider the resulting digital image to be an exact copy of the glass slide. A whole slide image used in a GLP-compliant study should include all the elements from the glass slide that are needed for histopathological examination or pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 4: Digital images comprise a sequence of small images (referred to as tiles) taken from distinct locations on the glass slide. Whole slide imaging systems typically determine the optimal focal plane at a limited, discrete set of locations on the glass slide and interpolate the optimal focal plane to generate all of the tiles. The individual tiles are then combined to create the \u201cwhole slide\u201d image.\n\nQ2: Should whole slide images be retained?\n\nA2: For GLP-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies, if whole slide images are assessed in lieu of the original glass slides and result in the generation of pathology raw data, the whole slide image files should be retained as study records and archived. Consideration should be given to ensure that archived digital images remain viewable as software/hardware updates/versions are implemented.\n\nQ3: If the whole slide image files are retained, should the glass slides also be retained?\n\nA3: Yes. The glass slides contain study specimens and must be retained as study specimens after study finalization in accordance with 21 CFR part 58.\n\nQ4: What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?\n--------------------\nContext title: Use of Whole Slide Imaging in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.1198456287384033", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance may help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the availability of remote digital pathology devices during this public health emergency. Increased availability of these devices may help to facilitate continuity of patient care by preventing disruptions to critical pathology services rendered by clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, and by reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThe enforcement policy described in this guidance applies to the following devices (\"digital pathology devices\"), which may be used during the COVID-19 public health emergency, when they are intended for use in remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides:\n\nTable 1\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Although the digital pathology devices listed above are typically used in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, as further discussed in Section IV below, many of these devices possess the capability for reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides from remote locations.\n\nIV Policy\n\nOverview\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency, expanding the availability of remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate pathology services while reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) (42 U.S.C. 263a) require that clinical laboratories, including those within hospitals and other healthcare settings, obtain a certificate before accepting materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or the impairment of, or assessment of the health of human beings.4 Digital pathology devices have not been cleared for home use or categorized as waived by FDA and as a result, these devices have been limited to use in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare settings that are CLIA-certified to perform nonwaived testing. However, in light of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a memorandum on March 26, 2020, describing its exercise of enforcement discretion to ensure pathologists may review pathology slides and images remotely. The CMS memorandum states that laboratories that choose to utilize temporary testing sites (e.g., for remote review and reporting of slides/images) may do so if certain criteria outlined in the memorandum are met.5\n\nFootnote 4: For more information, see FDA\u2019s guidance \u201cAdministrative Procedures for CLIA Categorization: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/administrative-procedures-clia-categorization.\n\nFootnote 5: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1:\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn general, manufacturers of the digital pathology devices listed in Table 1 are required to submit a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and receive FDA clearance prior to marketing these devices in the United States, as well as comply with post-marketing requirements.\n\nFDA recognizes that greater access to remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate the remote reviewing and reporting of pathology slides during this public health emergency which, in turn, may help facilitate continuity of patient care and reduce healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For that reason, for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to:\n\nmodifications to the FDA-cleared indications, functionality, hardware and/or software, of digital pathology devices identified in Table 1 above to provide for use in a remote setting, or\n\nthe marketing of new digital pathology devices of the types identified in Table 1 that are intended for use in remote settings and that are not currently 510(k) cleared for any use,\n\nwithout compliance with the following regulatory requirements, where such devices do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency: submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.81,6 Good Manufacturing Practice requirements in 21 CFR Part 820, and Unique Device Identification (UDI) requirements in 21 CFR Part 830 and 21 CFR 801.20.\n\nFootnote 6: For further guidance on modifications that trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a new premarket notification (510(k)) to FDA, refer to \u201cDeciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\u201d https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-change-existing-device.\n\nAdditionally, for remote digital pathology devices subject to this policy, FDA does not intend to enforce compliance with the special controls identified in 21 CFR 864.1860 (which are described in a special controls document for the submission of immunohistochemistry applications to the FDA7) and 21 CFR 864.3700 (83 FR 22), which includes requirements for the content of a premarket notification submission for a whole slide imaging system, where such devices or modifications do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 7: For more information, see \u201cGuidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the Food and Drug Administration,\u201d https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/guidance-submission-immunohistochemistry-applications-food-and-drug-administration-final-guidance.\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk where the performance and labeling elements in Section 2.2.2 are met.\n\nAppendix B Labeling and Performance\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk when the following circumstances related to the performance of the device and the product labeling, including instructions specific to remote use, are present. FDA encourages firms to discuss any alternatives to these recommendations with FDA (CDRH-COVID19-DigitalPathology/fda.hhs.gov).\n\nFDA recommends that remote digital pathology devices use labeling that helps users better understand the device or device modifications, including instructions specific for remote use, such as:\n\nInstructions for clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities to help them determine if remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides is feasible and appropriate based on an evaluation of their own information technology (IT) infrastructure and remote use environment for individual pathologists. FDA recommends that laboratories and hospitals consider performing a validation study where they deem necessary before remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides at a remote location.\n\nInstructions recommending that pathologists using such devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency use their clinical judgment to determine whether the quality of the images from the remote digital pathology devices are sufficient for interpretation of the pathological images.\n\nFDA recommends that manufacturers consider evaluating the performance of the device in accordance with the following FDA recognized standards, including (as applicable):\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment\n\nPart 1: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance_\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1-2: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance\n\nCollateral Standard: Electromagnetic Disturbances\n\nRequirements and Tests_\n\nAdditionally, while no device-specific performance recommendations are included in this enforcement policy, CLIA regulations and State law (including those related to performance) apply, although some CLIA regulations may be subject to CMS enforcement policies during this public health emergency.8\n\nFootnote 8: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-cerificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Remote Digital Pathology Devices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Clinical Laboratories, Healthcare Facilities, Pathologists, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.4171202182769775", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: Applicants should not include any file level security settings or password protection for individual files in the eCTD. Applicants should allow printing, changes to the document, selecting text and graphics, and adding or changing notes and form fields. Internal security and access control processes in the regulatory authority should maintain the integrity of the submitted files.\n\nReceipt\n\nUpon arrival at the regulatory authority, the submission is archived according to local regulations. A read-only copy of the submission is then made available to the review community in the regulatory authority.\n\nThis is typically done by placing the copy on a network server.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nEach regulatory authority should acknowledge the receipt of the eCTD submission according to the policy\n\nand procedure of the individual regulatory authority. Applicants should use the address in Table 5-1 to find guidance regarding acknowledgments.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:98]\n\nYou should submit the XML backbone as a single file named index.xml, which should be placed in the submission sequence number folder for that submission. In the example shown in Figure 6-1, there should be an index.xml file in folder \"0000\", folder \"0001\" and folder \"0002\". The MD5 checksum file, index.txt, should be in each folder with the corresponding index.xml file. The DTD for index.xml should be in the \"util\" folder for each submission.\n\nThe regional administrative XML backbone file should be in the region specific module 1 folder for each submission. For each sequence, the operation attribute of the leaf element referencing this file is always 'new'. A separate file containing the checksum of the regional index file is unnecessary as that file (and its MD5 checksum) is referenced by the index.xml file. The DTD for the regional XML backbone file should be in the util folder for each submission.\n\nTable 6-2 presents the file locations for the example in Figure 6-1.\n\nTable 6-2\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Submission Folder} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Files} \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0000 & index.xml \\  & index-md5.txt \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0000/m1/us & us-regional.xml \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0000/util/dtd & ich-ectd-3-x.dtd \\  & us-regional-vx-x.dtd \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0001 & index.xml \\  & index-md5.txt \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0001/m1/us & us-regional.xml \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0001/util/dtd & ich-ectd-3-x.dtd \\  & us-regional-vx-x.dtd \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0002 & index.xml \\  & index-md5.txt \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0002/m1/us & us-regional.xml \\ \\hline ctd-123456/0002/util/dtd & ich-ectd-3-x.dtd \\  & us-regional-vx-x.dtd \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nLife Cycle Management\n\nIt is important for the recipients of an eCTD to be able to establish the location of the submission in the life cycle of a product.\n--------------------\nContext title: eCTD_Specification_v3_2_2_0\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.264700412750244", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: For example, when images of several diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals read by the same criteria are being compared to establish relative efficacy (e.g., a comparison of a test drug or biological product to an established drug or biological product), we recommend the readers evaluate individual images from the merged set of images in a random sequence.\n\nFully blinded image evaluation\n\nDuring a fully blinded image evaluation, we recommend that readers not have any knowledge of the following types of information:\n\nResults of evaluation with the truth standard, of the final diagnosis, or of patient outcome\n\nAny patient-specific information (e.g., history, physical exam, laboratory results, results of other imaging studies)\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe recommend that general inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient enrollment, other details of the protocol, or anatomic orientation to the images not be provided to the readers.\n\nDuring a fully blinded image evaluation in studies where images obtained by different treatments are being evaluated, we recommend that readers not have knowledge of treatment identity, to the greatest extent to which that is possible.10 For example, in a comparative study of two or more medical imaging agents (or of two or more doses or regimens of a particular medical imaging agent), we suggest the blinded readers not know which agent (or which dose or regimen) was used to obtain a given image.\n\nFootnote 10: This is the common meaning of blinding in therapeutic clinical trials. See the ICH guidelines E8 General Considerations for Clinical Trials and E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials.\n\nFor contrast agents, we suggest this also can include lack of knowledge about which images were obtained before product administration and which were obtained after product administration, although sometimes this is apparent upon viewing the images.\n\nIn cases where the instructions for image evaluation differ according to treatment (e.g., as might be the case when images are obtained using different imaging modalities), blinding the readers to treatment identity may be infeasible.\n\nImage evaluation blinded to outcome\n\nAs in a fully blinded image evaluation, we recommend that readers performing an image evaluation blinded to outcome not have any knowledge of the results of evaluation with the truth standard, of the final diagnosis, or of patient outcome.\n\nHowever, in an image evaluation blinded to outcome, the readers might have knowledge of particular elements of patient-specific information (e.g., history, physical exam, laboratory results, or results of other imaging studies). In some cases, the readers also might be aware of general inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient enrollment, other details of the protocol, or anatomic orientation to the images. We recommend that the particular elements about which the reader will have information be standardized for all patients and defined prospectively in the clinical trial protocol, statistical plan, and the blinded image evaluation plan.\n\nIn studies where images obtained by different treatments are being evaluated (including no treatment, such as in unenhanced image evaluation of a contrast agent), we recommend that the readers not have knowledge of treatment identity, to the greatest extent to which that is possible (see section IV.2.3.1).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]\n\n[531] enrollment, other details of the protocol, and of anatomic orientation to the images.\n\n[533] Unblinded image evaluations can be used to show consistency with the results of fully blinded image evaluations or image evaluations blinded to outcome. We recommend that these blinded and unblinded image evaluations use the same endpoints so that the results can be compared. However, we recommend that unblinded image evaluations not be used as the principal image evaluation for demonstration of efficacy. The unblinded readers may have access to additional information that may alter the readers' diagnostic assessments and may confound or bias the image evaluation by these readers.\n\n[542]\n\n[543] Independent Image Evaluations\n\n[544] Two events are independent if knowing the outcome of one event says nothing about the outcome of the other. Therefore, as used in this guidance, independent readers are readers that are completely unaware of findings of other readers (including findings of other blinded readers and onsite investigators) and are readers who are not otherwise influenced by the findings of other readers. To ensure that blinded reader's evaluations remain independent, we recommend that each blinded reader's evaluation be locked in the dataset shortly after it is obtained and before additional types of image evaluations are performed (see section IV.B.7.c).\n\n[54] Consensus image evaluations\n\n[556] As used in this guidance, consensus image evaluations (consensus reads) are image evaluations during which readers convene to evaluate images together. Consensus image evaluations can be performed after the individual readings are completed and locked. However, readers are not considered independent during consensus reads and therefore we recommend that such reads not serve as the primary image evaluation used to demonstrate the efficacy of medical imaging agents. Although a consensus read is performed by several readers, it is actually a single image-evaluation and is unlikely to fulfill our interest in image evaluations by multiple blinded readers. As with the individual blinded evaluations, we recommend that the consensus reads be locked once obtained and before additional types of blinded readings are performed.\n\n[567] Repeated image evaluations by the same reader\n\n[569] In studies where readers evaluate the same image multiple times (e.g., as in sequential unblinding, or in readings designed to assess intra_reader variability), we recommend that the readings be performed independently of one another to the fullest extent practical. The goal is to minimize _recall bias. We further recommend that readers be unaware, to the fullest extent practical, of their own previous image findings and not be otherwise influenced by those previous findings.\n\n5.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe recommend that different pages in the CRF be used for the two image evaluations and that each image evaluation be performed with sufficient time between readings to decrease recall and without reference to prior results.\n\n5.2.3 Offsite and Onsite Image Evaluations\n\nAs used in this guidance, offset image evaluations are image evaluations performed at sites that have not otherwise been involved in the conduct of the study and by readers who have not had contact with patients, investigators, or other individuals involved in the study. We recommend that Phase 3 trials include offsite image evaluations that are performed at a limited number of sites (or preferably at a centralized site). In such offsite evaluations, it is usually easier to control factors that can compromise the integrity of the blinded image evaluations and to ensure that the blinded readers perform their image evaluations independently of other image evaluations.\n\nAs used in this guidance, onsite image evaluations are image evaluations performed by investigators involved in the conduct of the protocol or in the care of the patient. The term also can refer to blinded image evaluations performed at sites involved with the conduct of the study. Onsite investigators may have additional information about the patients that was not predefined in the clinical trial protocol. Such additional information may alter the investigators' diagnostic assessments and may confound or bias the image evaluation by the investigators. Therefore, we recommend that onsite image evaluations usually not be used as the principal image evaluation for demonstration of efficacy, but be regarded as supportive of the blinded image evaluations.\n\nHowever, we suggest onsite investigators who are blinded to truth (e.g., blinded to any test result that makes up the truth standard, to the final diagnosis, and to patient final outcome as in an image evaluation blinded to outcome see (section 4.2.3.2)) can be used for principal image evaluation. In such instances, we recommend that all clinical information available to the investigator at the time of the image evaluation be clearly specified and fully documented. We also recommend that a critical assessment of how such information might have influenced the readings be performed. In addition, we recommend that an independent blinded evaluation that is supportive of the finding of efficacy be performed.\n\n5.2.4 Assessment of Interreader and Intrareader Variability\n\nWe recommend that at least two blinded readers (and preferably three or more) evaluate images for each study that is intended to demonstrate efficacy. (The truth standard, however, may be read by a single blinded reader.) The use of multiple readers allows for an evaluation of the reproducibility of the readings (i.e., interreader variability) and provides a better basis for subsequent generalization of any findings. Ideally, we recommend that each reader view all of the images intended to demonstrate efficacy, both for the investigational imaging agent and the truth standard, so that interreader agreement can be measured. In large studies, where it may be impractical to have everyimage read by each reader, a properly chosen subset of images can be selected for such duplicate image evaluations. We recommend that consistency among readers be measured quantitatively (e.g., with the kappa statistic).\n\nWe recommend that _intra_reader variability be assessed during the development of medical imaging agents. This can be accomplished by having individual blinded readers perform repeated image evaluations on some or all images (see section IV.B.8.b).\n\nProtocol and Nonprotocol Images\n--------------------\nContext title: Developing Medical Imaging Drug and Biological Products Part 3- Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Clinical Studies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.538517951965332", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: The minimum installation and qualification testing to be performed during installation or when an imaging system is being relocated, which as is currently only required for manufacturers of diagnostic x-ray systems who must provide revised instructions for assembly, installation, adjustment, and testing information required in accordance with 21 CFR 1020.30(g) as necessary based on the modifications.\n\nThe minimum post-installation inspection, calibration, testing, and maintenance to be performed to sustain safe and effective operation of the product, that result from the product modifications.\n\nA clear distinction delineating FDA-cleared or FDA-approved indications and technical specifications from those that are not FDA-cleared or FDA-approved.

This includes certain clinical decision support (CDS) software functions which are excluded from the definition of a device by section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act. Specifically, this section excludes, from the definition of device, software functions that meet all of the following four criteria:\n\nNOT intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system (section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act);\n\nintended for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, or printing medical information about a patient or other medical information (such as peer-reviewed clinical studies and clinical practice guidelines) (section 520(o)(1)(E)(i) of the FD&C Act);\n\nintended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to a health care professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition (section 520(o)(1)(E)(ii) of the FD&C Act); and,\n\nintended for the purpose of enabling such health care professional to independently review the basis for such recommendations that such software presents so that it is not the intent that such health care professional rely primarily on any of such recommendations to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual patient (section 520(o)(1)(E)(iii) of the FD&C Act).29 Footnote 29: The Cures Act provides that a software function described in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act will not be excluded from the device definition under section 201(h) if the software meets the criteria under section 513(a)(1)(C) of\n\n4.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe following are examples of non-device functions under section 520(o) consistent with the draft guidance on Clinical Decision Support Software:30\n\nFootnote 30: FDA has issued a draft guidance on Clinical Decision Support Software (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory:information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-support-software). It is a draft for public comment only and not for implementation.\n\nSoftware that uses a patient's diagnosis (or presumptive diagnosis) to provide a healthcare provider with current practice treatment guidelines based on any imaging findings of COVID-19 or co-existing conditions, and provides the source of the guidelines;\n\nSoftware that provides healthcare providers with recommendations on the appropriate use of imaging and recommended protocols for a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling or that are described in other sources from professional medical imaging societies. The practice guidelines are described as the basis for the recommendation and provided for the healthcare professional to review, such that the healthcare provider does not rely primarily on the software's recommendation; and\n\nSoftware that compares imaging findings with available practice guidelines (institutions-based or academic/clinical society-based) to recommend condition-specific diagnostic tests, investigations, monitoring, or therapy or triaging patient care. The practice guidelines are described as the basis for the recommendation and provided for the healthcare professional to review, such that the healthcare provider does not rely primarily on the software's recommendation.\n\nV Policy to Help Increase Availability and Minimize Supply Chain Disruptions\n\nIn developing this policy, FDA's intent is to help expand the availability of imaging products, including mobile and portable diagnostic imaging systems, in the United States for the duration of the public health emergency while being flexible regarding the maintenance of devices and the reporting required under 21 CFR Chapter I - Subchapter J to help ensure the continued availability of safe and effective medical imaging systems. Wherever possible, health care facilities should use FDA-cleared or approved medical imaging systems and maintain this system following the manufacturer's or other recommended maintenance schedule.\n\nFDA encourages facilities to ensure essential imaging systems continue to be operational, safe, and effective. However, FDA recommends prioritization of those tasks most essential to maintaining continuity of patient care and to protecting the public health and safety from electronic product radiation.\n\nUnder existing policies, FDA generally has not enforced FD&C Act requirements with respect toservicing activities,31 including the use of alternative available components that are compatible with and do not significantly change the performance or safety specifications, or intended use, of the product.32 However, activities that significantly change the performance or safety specifications, or intended use of the device are remanufacturing and are not servicing. These existing policies might be relevant in the context of identifying alternative components or suppliers to address anticipated shortages or to meeting increased demand for mobile and portable imaging systems.33\n\nFootnote 31: Servicing activities include actions to refurbish, recondition, rebuild, repair, and remarket medical devices.\n\nFootnote 32: See FDA Report on the Quality, Safety, and Effectiveness of Servicing of Medical Devices (May 2018) at 4, 5, 24, available at https://www.fda.gov/media/113431/download (explaining FDA\u2019s approach to servicing activities and distinguishing those activities from remanufacturing, which \u201csignificantly changes the finished device\u2019s performance or safety specifications, or intended use\u201d), quoting 21 CFR 820.3(w).\n\nFootnote 33: For example, see \u201cGuidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff - Assembler\u2019s Guide to Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-and-food-and-drug-administration-staff-assemblers-guide-diagnostic-x-ray-equinment.\n\nIn addition to the available considerations above, for the duration of the public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to the following:\n\nDelay of actions required pursuant to 21 CFR 1004 to repurchase, repair, or replace defects or failures in electronic products that are non-life threatening or non-serious if the manufacturer cannot access the system, is partially shutdown, or is having difficulty obtaining parts from suppliers. FDA intends to place the completion timeline specified in any Corrective Action Approval letter on hold for the duration of the public health emergency. In such cases, the manufacturer should take actions that sufficiently reduce the risk by:\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Imaging Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.416611671447754"], "When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nPreface\n\nSince the ICH Q7 Guidance was finalised, experience with implementing the guidance worldwide has given rise to requests for clarification of uncertainties due to the interpretation of certain sections.

A table is provided as an Annex of this document showing the link between each Q&A and the relevant Sections of ICH Q7 and other ICH Quality guidance.\n\nICH would like to acknowledge the work undertaken by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S). PIC/S contributed to this document by selecting and reviewing relevant Q&As that had been collected from training sessions since the implementation of Q7 and transferred the output of these reviews to the ICH Q7 IWG for consideration and consolidation, as appropriate. Additional questions were developed based on responses from an ICH survey. PIC/S further contributed to the development of the document as an ICH Interested Party.\n\nPlease note that ICH Q7 should be applied in combination with the principles laid down for development and manufacturing in ICH Q11 (see definition of API starting material; see also ICH Q8(R2) Part II), Quality Risk Management (ICH Q9), and Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10). GMP principles as described in ICH Q7 should be applied regardless which approach is taken in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.\n\nICH Q7 also describes principles of GMPs to be applied in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials (Section 19) and for APIs manufactured by cell culture/fermentation (Section 18).\n\nDated: 10 June 2015\n\n1 INTRODUCTION - SCOPE\n\n1.2 & June 2015 & Does ICH Q7 apply to manufacturing Steps for the addition of substance(s) to an API (e.g., to stabilise the API)? & When a mixture is classified in the regulatory filing as an API in a region or country in which it is used in a drug product, ICH Q7 should be applied to the manufacturing of these mixtures [ICH Q7, Section 1.2, 20 - see Glossary for definition of 'API'].\n\n2 QUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\n3.

However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.5412211418151855", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARMONISATION OF TECHICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE\n\nICH HARMONISED TRIPARTITE GUIDELINE\n\nGood Manufacturing Practice Guide for\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nQ7\n\nCurrent Step 4 version\n\ndated 10 November 2000\n\nThis Guideline has been developed by the appropriate ICH Expert Working Group and has been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH Process.

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide \"manufacturing\" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term \"should\" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms \"current good manufacturing practices\" and \"good manufacturing practices\" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.2113988399505615", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nBackground and Objectives\n\nDevelopment process\n\nScope/ Content\n\nRegulatory implementation\n\nKey message\n\nSummary\n\nFirst internationally harmonized Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidance developed jointly by industry and regulators under the ICH umbrella\n\nFinalized November 2000 and adopted by most major Health Authorities including WHO\n\nEstablishes one global GMP guideline for Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (APIs)\n\nIntended to facilitate API inspections\n\nImportant to international cooperative regulation of API manufacturing* ICH Q7 was published in 2000\n\nAPI manufacturing technology and practices have evolved since then\n\nGood Distribution Practice (GDP) for API was included in ICH Q7\n\nAPI supply chains are global and complex\n\nCurrently, many different health authorities regulate and/or inspect API manufacturers\n\nRegulators continue to find significant GMP deficiencies during API inspections\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n*Questions were obtained from various sources\n\nIncluding existing Q&As from the PIC/S API Expert Circle, PDA/ Regulatory training 2002\n\nSurvey of constituencies for issues needing clarification conducted by the ICH Q7 IWG Feb.- Mar. 2013\n\nIWG** * Evaluated about 200 questions and suggested answers * Consolidated, drafted, revised Q&As as needed * 5 face-to-face meetings and several regional and worldwide teleconferences * Consensus on 55 Q&As achieved on April 20, 2015\n\nThe Step 4 ICH harmonised document was posted to ICH website (www.ich.org) on 10 June 2015\n\nQuestions cover all sections of ICH Q7 except Section 9 (Packaging and Identification Labelling of APIs/ Intermediates)\n\nICH Q7 sections with the most Q&As were: Quality Management Materials Management Process Equipment Laboratory Controls\n\nQ&As include references to other ICH guidelines, including to Q8, Q9, Q10 and Q11 which were established after Q7 was finalised in 2000.\n\n2.

However, ICH Q11 does describe fundamental science and risk-based concepts that should be used to evaluate the impact of post-approval changes to the process after the starting material (ICH Q11 Section 9 - Lifecycle Management), and these same concepts should be applied to evaluate the impact of changes upstream of the starting material.\n\nFor example, changes upstream of the starting material should be evaluated for their impact on the starting material (e.g., on current and potential new impurities, including potentially mutagenic and elemental impurities) and, when appropriate, on the drug substance. The evaluation could be based on 23 August 2017\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{128.0pt}|p{128.0pt}|p{128.0pt}|} \\hline  & & risk assessment and scientific understanding of the proposed change and its proximity to the starting material.

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.652435779571533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.622267007827759", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 19: For more information, see the draft guidance for IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors Informed Consent Information Sheet. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nUnder section 704(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)), FDA may inspect and copy records relating to the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.58(a), 312.68, and 812.145(b)). FDA generally will not copy records that include the subject's name unless there is reason to believe the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. When FDA requires subject names, FDA will treat such information as confidential. On rare occasions, FDA may be required to disclose this information to third parties, such as to a court of law (see 21 CFR 20.63(a) and 20.83(a) and (b)). Therefore, the consent process should not promise or imply absolute confidentiality by FDA.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor systems that are interoperable or fully integrated, sponsors and clinical investigators should have a detailed understanding of data flow and data visibility to allow for a clear description in the informed consent of the parties granted access to the patient's data.\n\nVI Inspection, recordkeeping, and record retention requirements\n\nFDA must have access to records and may inspect and copy all records pertaining to a clinical investigation in accordance with 21 CFR 312.62, 312.68, 812.140, and 812.145. All relevant information in the EHR pertaining to the clinical investigation must be made available to FDA for review upon request (21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a), and 812.145).20 This information should be made available and viewable to FDA as original records in the EHR or as certified copies. During an inspection, FDA may also request other paper or electronic records to support data in the eCRF (e.g., case histories, other data pertaining to the clinical investigation) (see 21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a)(3), and 812.145). In addition, FDA may request to review the EHR audit trail information during inspection.\n\nFootnote 20: If the necessary records are not available for a foreign clinical study that is not conducted under an IND, FDA may not accept the study data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval. If the records exist but a sponsor or an applicant cannot disclose them to FDA because such disclosure is prohibited by applicable foreign law, the sponsor or applicant may seek a waiver of this requirement (21 CFR 312.120(c)). For FDA to rely on such data that cannot be disclosed, the sponsor and FDA would need to agree on an alternative validation procedure.

Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, \"Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24.

In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject's case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject's case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject's copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, \u201cCoercion and Undue Influence\u201d.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject's LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject's LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\u201d and Frequently Asked Question #7, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\u201d In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?\u201d, Frequently Asked Question #4, \u201cWhat process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?\u201d, and Frequently Asked Question #5, \u201cWhat process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?\u201d\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject's LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: \u201cThe fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the \u2018form\u2019 provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.\u201d\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject's consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject's questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject's LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.7337743043899536", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: III FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n\nNo informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.\n\nii.2.1 Exceptions to Informed Consent\n\nInformed consent is required for participation in FDA-regulated clinical investigations except under limited circumstances as described in 21 CFR 50.23 (involving certain life-threatening situations, military operations, or public health emergencies) and 21 CFR 50.24 (involving emergency research16) (see 21 CFR 50.20). We note that, to implement statutory changes made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) Act by section 3024 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), FDA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would allow IRBs responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of clinical investigations to approve an informed consent procedure that waives or alters certain informed consent elements or that waives the requirement to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations.17({}^{,})18 In addition, FDA issued guidance explaining that until the Agency promulgates regulations implementing the Cures Act amendments to the FD&C Act, FDA does not intend to object to an IRB approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or to an IRB waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations under the circumstances described in the guidance.19 Nothing in FDA's informed consent regulations is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law (21 CFR 50.25(e)).\n\nFootnote 16: See \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 17: See section 3024 of the Cures Act, Pub. L. 114-255, available at https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ255/PLAW-114publ255.pdf.\n\nFootnote 18: See \u201cInstitutional Review Board Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent for Minimal Risk Clinical Investigations,\u201d (83 FR 57378, November 15, 2018) at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-11-15/pdf/2018-24822.pdf.\n\nii.2.2 Coercion and Undue Influence\n\nThe conditions under which informed consent is sought and the relationship between the subject and the person obtaining consent should be carefully considered to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence (21 CFR 50.20). According to the Belmont Report, \"Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue influence,by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance.\"20\n\nFootnote 20: The Belmont Report was written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Commission, created as a result of the National Research Act of 1974, was charged with identifying the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. See Belmont Report, available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html.\n\nFor example, if an employer seeks to enroll employees in a clinical investigation sponsored or conducted by the employer, the informed consent process should contain safeguards to ensure that participation is voluntary and that the possibility of undue influence or coercion by supervisors, peers, or others is minimized. Similarly, because of a potential conflict of interest and the nature of the physician-patient relationship,21 when the investigator is also the prospective subject's physician, for example, the-investigator should ensure that the prospective subject understands that enrollment in the clinical investigation is voluntary, and that a decision to forgo enrollment will not adversely affect their medical care, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(a)(8). The consent process and form should emphasize that an individual's participation is truly voluntary.\n\nNote that coercion and undue influence may be situational, and can affect any population, not just subject populations seen as vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. For example, in a clinical investigation involving the collection of extra tissue samples during a planned surgical procedure, waiting to obtain informed consent until the prospective subject is in the preoperative area would generally fail to minimize the possibility of undue influence. The possibility of undue influence could be addressed by first discussing the study with the prospective subject during a preoperative visit as part of the informed consent process. The prospective subject could be told that the study will be reviewed with them again prior to the procedure and, after all questions are resolved, they will be asked to sign a consent form acknowledging their willingness to participate in the study at that time.\n\nIn addition, statements that claim investigational drugs and devices are safe or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated are prohibited (21 CFR 312.7(a) and 21 CFR 812.7(d)). Likewise, statements that overstate the possibility of benefit may unduly influence prospective subjects by leading them to incorrectly assume that it is known that the investigational product will be of benefit to them, influencing them to agree to participate when they might not have otherwise chosen to do so. For example, wording that refers to the clinical investigation as a \"therapeutic trial\" could contribute to a prospective subject's misunderstanding that the trial will offer a direct benefit for their disease or condition.\n\nFurthermore, we generally recommend against including statements such as \"FDA has given permission for the clinical investigation to proceed\" or \"FDA has approved the clinical investigation\" in the informed consent process, because such statements may suggest to subjects that the investigation has FDA's endorsement. In addition, these statements may not be accurate for the particular clinical investigation at issue (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.40(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\nFDA does not consider reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to and from the clinical trial site (e.g., airfare, gas, tolls), and associated costs, such as parking and lodging, to raise issues related to coercion or undue influence. Reimbursement for other expenses may be considered by an IRB on a case-by-case basis, and IRBs should consider whether the proposed remuneration could be an undue influence. Payment for participation in research should be just and fair. This topic is also discussed under sectionIII.2.3, \"Benefits.\"\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.301215648651123"], "According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule \u201cRequirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products\u201d (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule \u201cContent and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling\u201d (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095\u201396).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3786636292934418", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Office of Medical Policy, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Bldg. 51, rm. 6337, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information related to the submission of a BLA under section 351(k) of the PHS Act have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0719, and the collections of information in 21 CFR part 601 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0338.\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collection provisions in this guidance, including resulting proposed modifications to the information collections approved under OMB control number 0910-0338, have been submitted to OMB for review as required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and are not for current implementation.

Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoeetin alfa.\n\nInterchangeable Product means a biological product that has been shown to meet the standards described in section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act and may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nNonproprietary Name means a name unprotected by trademark rights that is in the public domain. It may be used by the public at large, both lay and professional.\n\nOriginator Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) that is not a related biological product.\n\nProper Name means the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act.18\n\nFootnote 18: Section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(1)(B)(i) and \u00a7 600.3(k)( 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nProprietary Name means the trademark or brand name.\n\nReference Product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nRelated Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) for which there is a previously licensed biological product submitted in a different section 351(a) BLA that contains a drug substance for which certain nomenclature conventions (e.g., United States Adopted Names (USAN) Guiding Principles19) would be expected to provide for use of the same drug substance name.20\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1242538690567017", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.2097504138946533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n\nFor directive statements and recommendations for preventing, monitoring, managing, or mitigating risks (e.g., \"Discontinue NEXSYMEO in patients with [adverse reaction]\") -- Such statements are typically included in, but are not limited to, the BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS sections.\n\nThe biosimilar product's proper name should be used when referring to the drug substance. An example would be to use the biosimilar product's proper name in the DESCRIPTION section.\n\nWhen use of the reference product name is recommended:\n\nWhen clinical studies or data derived from studies with the reference product are described in biosimilar product labeling, the reference product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-hjsf) should be used. This information would typically be included in sections such as, but not limited to, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Clinical Trials Experience subsection) and CLINICAL STUDIES.\n\nWhen use of the core name is recommended:14\n\nFootnote 14: Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoetin alfa. The proper name for biological products will include a distinguishing suffix composed of four lowercase letters attached to the core name with a hyphen.\n\nThe overall risk-benefit profile of the reference product is relevant to the biosimilar product, even if a particular serious adverse reaction or other risk included in the reference product labeling may not have been reported with the biosimilar product at the time of licensure. In labeling sections where the risk applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (e.g., BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, Warnings and PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Postmarketing Experience subsection)), it would be appropriate to use the core name of the reference product followed by the word \"products\" (e.g., replicamab products) to convey, for instance, that a risk or other information necessary for the safe use of the product applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (see section IV.B of this guidance).\n\nFor example, in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nReference Product Labeling & Biosimilar Product Labeling \\ \\hline Treatment with JUNEXANT increases & Treatment with replicamab products \\ the risk of serious infections involving & increases the risk of serious infections \\ various organ systems and sites that may & involving various organ systems and sites \\ lead to hospitalization or death. & that may lead to hospitalization or death. \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n4. When use of more than one product name is recommended:\n\nThere may be text appropriately based on the reference product labeling where more than one of these product identification approaches should be used to convey information accurately.\n\nTherefore, all text in biosimilar product labeling, even sections that have been based on reference product labeling, should be carefully evaluated for the most appropriate product identification approach. In some cases, such as the following example, more than two of the approaches may be used:\n\nReplicamab products can cause hepatotoxicity and acute hepatic failure. In clinical trials of replicamab-hjxf, 10% of patients developed elevated ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and 5% progressed to acute hepatic failure. Evaluate serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin at baseline and monthly during treatment with NEXSYMEO...\n\nApproaches to Content Presentation\n\nThe labeling for the biosimilar product should be specific to the conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) sought for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with language previously approved for the reference product for those conditions of use.\n\nWhen a biosimilar product applicant obtains licensure for fewer than all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) for which the reference product is licensed, certain text in the reference product labeling related to condition(s) of use for the reference product that are not licensed for the biosimilar product would generally not be included in the biosimilar product labeling.15 However, in certain circumstances it may be necessary to include information in the biosimilar product labeling relating to an indication(s) for which the biosimilar product is not licensed, in order to help ensure safe use (e.g., when safety information in the reference product labeling is related to use of the product and is not specific to a particular licensed indication(s) or when information specific to only the biosimilar product's indication(s) cannot be easily extracted).16 Such text should be written in a manner that does not imply that the biosimilar product is licensed for a reference product indication(s) or use(s) that has not been licensed for the biosimilar product. In these circumstances, specific sections of labeling that could be affected include BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS.\n\nFootnote 16: See also 21 CFR 201.57(c)(6)(i).\n\nFor example, for sections such as WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS, the reference product labeling may pool and categorize events from all the reference product clinical trials for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed. In cases where the biosimilar product applicant is not seeking licensure for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed, the pooled data described in the reference product labeling should be included in the biosimilar product labeling in a manner that is not indication-specific. However, any text that refers to an indication for which the biosimilar product applicant is not currently seeking licensure and is included to ensure safe use of the biosimilar product should be revised to avoid an implication that the biosimilar has been licensed for that indication(s).\n\nApproaches to Specific Sections of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION (Highlights) a. Initial U.S. approval\n\nThe initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section is the year that the biosimilar product is licensed.\n\nb. Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product's proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product's proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word \"biosimilar.\"For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product's indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.470449686050415", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: A.I.7. An applicant generally may obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nFor information about the licensure of a proposed interchangeable product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.5\n\nFootnote 5: As explained in that guidance, FDA generally expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product\u2019s licensed conditions of use.\n\nQ.1.8. Can a sponsor use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.8. A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.\n\nIf a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. As a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies(e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compare all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product), and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK data or, when appropriate, PD data, for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the prespecified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed. A final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge will be made during the review of the application.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include but are not limited to the following:\n\nRelevance of the design of the clinical program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product for the condition(s) of use and patient population(s) for which licensure is sought\n\nRelationship between the license holder for the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and BLA holder for the U.S.-licensed reference product\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was manufactured in a facility(ies) licensed and inspected by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) countries)\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries) and the duration and extent to which the product has been marketed\n\nScientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK or, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on product performance\n\nA sponsor should also address any other factors that may affect the relevance of comparative data with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to an assessment of biosimilarity with the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA sponsor may submit publicly available information regarding the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to justify the extent of comparative data needed to establish a bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. The complexity of the products, particularly with respect to higher order structure, post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), and the degree of heterogeneity associated with the product may affect the considerations for the scientific justification regarding the extent of bridging data. Additional factors that FDA may consider regarding the extent of bridging data include but are not limited to the following:\n\nWhether the formulation, dosage form, and strength of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products are the same\n\nRoute of administration of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products\n\nDesign of the physicochemical and biological/functional assessments and the use of multiple orthogonal methods with adequate sensitivity to detect differences among the products\n\nScientific justification for the selection of the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used to establish the scientific bridge and how the selected lots relate to the material used in the nonclinical and clinical studies; the scientific bridge should include a sufficient number of lots of non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to adequately capture the variability in product quality attributes, and when possible, the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used in the nonclinical or clinical studies should be included in the assessment performed to establish the analytical bridge\n\nSponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of this scientific justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFor more information about whether a non-U.S.-licensed comparator can be used in studies intended to support the additional criteria required for a determination of interchangeability with the reference product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.\n\nQ.I.9.: Is a clinical study to assess the potential of the biological product to delay cardiac repolarization (a QT/QTc study) or a drug-drug interaction study generally needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.9. In general, a 351(k) application for a proposed biosimilar product may rely upon the Agency's previous determination of safety, purity, and potency for the reference product, including any clinical QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential and drug-drug interactions. If such studies were not required for the reference product, then these data generally would not be needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, if the BLA holder for the reference product has been required to conduct postmarket studies or clinical trials under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to assess or identify a certain risk related to a QT/QTc study or a drug-drug interaction study and those studies have not yet been completed, then FDA may impose similar postmarket requirements on the 351(k) applicant in appropriate circumstances.\n\nQ.1.10: How long and in what manner should sponsors retain reserve samples of the biological products used in comparative clinical PK and/or PD studies intended to support a 351(k) application? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.10.: Reserve samples establish the identity of the products tested in the actual study, allow for confirmation of the validity and reliability of the results of the study, and facilitate investigation of further follow-up questions that arise after the studies are completed. FDA recommends that the sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product retain reserve samples for at least 5 years following the date on which the 351(k) application is licensed, or, if such application is not licensed, at least 5 years following the date of completion of a comparative clinical PK and/or PD study of the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product (or other clinical study in which PK or PD samples are collected with the primary objective of assessing PK or PD similarity) that is intended to support a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Contact FDA for specific advice if an alternative approach is being considered. For a three-way PK similarity study, FDA recommends that samples of both comparator products be retained, in addition to samples of the proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor most protein therapeutics, FDA recommends that a sponsor retain the following quantities of product and dosage units, which are expected to be sufficient for evaluation by state of the art analytical methods:\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.534909963607788", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Section 607 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, redesignated section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act as section 7002(e)(4)(A) and added the title \u201cIn General\u201d to the new subparagraph. Confoming revisions have been made throughout this guidance to refer to the new subparagraph.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the \"Hatch-Waxman Amendments\"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger, and typically more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system, such as a microorganism or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines \"biosimilarity\" to mean \"that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for \"interchangeability,\" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\n2 Transition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a biological product (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below.\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class5 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA has interpreted the statutory term_product class_ for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period(see FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCIAct (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance), at Q. II.2). We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory:information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"6 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for a biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed BLA\") on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B) of the BPCI Act). For additional information about FDA's interpretation of this \"transition\" provision, please refer to FDA's guidance for industry Interpretation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (December 2018) (Transition Policy Final Guidance).\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nIdentification of Products Subject to the Transition Provision\n\n1 What products are affected by the transition provision? How will the holder of an approved new drug application (NDA) for a biological product know if it will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nThe \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act (also known as the transition provision) will apply on March 23, 2020, to each approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act.7 The BPCI Act and Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, amended the definition of a \"biological product\" in section 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a \"protein.\"\n\nFootnote 7: General references in this guidance to \u201capplications\u201d submitted or approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act also may include ANDAs, to the extent applicable. An ANDA generally must contain information to demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug has the same active ingredient(s), conditions of use, dosage form, route of administration, strength, and (with certain permissible differences) labeling as the reference listed drug (section 505(i)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). Given the complexity of protein molecules and limitations of current analytical methods, it may be difficult for manufacturers of proposed protein products to demonstrate that the active ingredient in their proposed product is the same as the active ingredient in an already approved product, and thus ANDAs are not a focus of this guidance. There are no currently marketed bio logical products that were approved through the ANDA pathway.\n\nFDA has previously stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended statutory definition of \"biological product.\"8 As explained in FDA's final rule entitled \"Definition of the Term \"Biological Product\" (Biological Product Definition Final Rule), FDA interprets the term \"protein\" to mean any alpha amino acid polymer with a specific defined sequence that is greater than 40 amino acids in size. When two or more amino acid chains in an amino acid polymer are associated with each other in a manner that occurs in nature, the size of the amino acid polymer for purposes of this interpretation will be based on the total number of amino acids in those chains, and will not be limited to the number of amino acids in a contiguous sequence.9 FDA interprets the statutory definition of \"biological product\" such that any amino acid polymer composed of 40 or fewer amino acids (i.e., a \"peptide\") is outside the scope of the term \"protein.\" A \"peptide\" is not a \"biological product\" and will continue to be regulated as a drug under the FD&C Act unless the peptide otherwise meets the statutory definition of a \"biological product\" (e.g., a peptide vaccine) (see Q. II.1 in FDA's draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Q&As on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2) (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance)). Moreover, a drug product that contains a protein only as an inactive ingredient (e.g., a drug product formulated with human serum albumin as an inactive ingredient) is not considered to be a \"protein\" for purposes of the statutory definition of \"biological product\" and the transition provision of the BPCI Act.\n\nFootnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.6382761001586914"], "Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a \"statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content.\" What does FDA consider to be a \"sweetener?\" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term \"sweetener\" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.600752115249634", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.3718528747558594", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9627195596694946", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1707110404968262", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: References\n\n[1] FDA, DHHS, \"Guidance for Industry: Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,\" September 18, 1998.\n\n[2] FSIS, USDA, \"National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi2\n\n[3] dhname=1999 register&docid=99-30222-filed),\" 64 FR 63281-63282, November 19, 1999.\n\n[4] NACMCF, \"National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food, Meeting on Fresh Citrus Juice; Transcript of Proceedings,\" December 8 to 9, 1999, public meeting.\n\nThe above guidance document supercedes the previous version dated December 21, 2001.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \\hline\nPrevious Regulatory Requirements/Guidance for Achieving a 5-Log Pathogen Reduction & Current Regulatory Requirements/Guidance for Achieving a 5-Log Pathogen Reduction \\ \\hline\n5-log reduction must occur in target pathogen for a period of at least as long as the shelf-life of the product stored under normal or moderate abuse conditions (juice labeling rule, 21 CFR 101.17(g) (7)(i)). & No change (21 CFR 101.17(g)(7)(i)); 21 CFR 120.24(a)). \\ \\hline\n5-log pathogen reduction may include measures taken during farming, harvesting, or processing over which the processor has control and which are effective (Small Entity Compliance Guide). & 5-log pathogen reduction and final packaging should occur under one firm\u2019s control and within a single production facility.

Discussion\n\nThis guidance is intended to help consumers make informed choices among sweeteners by promoting accurate and consistent labeling. To that end, we are advising the regulated industry of our view that the term \"evaporated cane juice\" is not the common or usual name of any type of sweetener and that this ingredient should instead be declared on food labels as \"sugar,\" preceded by one or more truthful, non-misleading descriptors if the manufacturer so chooses (e.g., \"cane sugar\").\n\nIn developing this guidance, FDA reviewed the Codex Alimentarius Commission's (Codex's) Standard for Sugars, Codex Stan. 212-1999 (Ref. 4), which provides standards for certain sugars intended for human consumption without further processing, to determine whether Codex had established a standard for a product similar to that described on some U.S. food labels as \"evaporated cane juice.\" The Codex Standard for Sugars contains no product identified as \"evaporated cane juice.\" However, the Codex standard does define \"raw cane sugar\"3 as \"[p]artially purified sucrose, which is crystallised from partially purified cane juice, without further purification, but which does not preclude centrifugation or drying, and which is characterised by sucrose crystals covered with a film of cane molasses.\" This standard appears to describe the same sweetener referred to in many of the comments as \"evaporated cane juice.\" We agree that the common or usual name used to describe this ingredient on food labels should include the term \"sugar\" because that term describes the basic nature and characterizing properties of the food.\n\nIn contrast, the term \"evaporated cane juice\" describes neither the basic nature of the food nor its characterizing properties, and therefore does not comply with 21 CFR 102.5(a). \"Juice\" is defined by 21 CFR 120.1(a) as \"the aqueous liquid expressed or extracted from one or more fruits or vegetables, pures of the edible portions of one or more fruits or vegetables, or any concentrates of such liquid or puree.\" This relatively narrow definition is the one used for purposes of the juice hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) regulations (21 CFR Part 120) and the juice labeling regulation in 21 CFR 101.30. There are broader definitions of \"juice\" that are used in other contexts. For example, in the context of botany and food technology, \"juice\" is a general term referring to the fluid extract of any plant.4 However, in the context of diet and nutrition, \"juice\" has the narrower meaning reflected in the definition of \"juice\" in 21 CFR 120.1(a), which covers only liquid obtained from fruits or vegetables. Although we do not dispute that sugar cane is a member of the vegetable kingdom in the broad sense of classifying an article as \"animal,\" \"vegetable,\" or \"mineral,\" FDA considers the term \"vegetable\" in the context of the juice definition to refer more narrowly to edible plant parts that consumers are accustomed to eating as vegetables in their diet. Sugar cane is not a vegetable in this sense. While consumers can purchase pieces of sugar cane, consumers do not eat sugar cane as a \"vegetable\" but instead use it as a source of sugar by chewing on the cane or its fibers or by placing the cane in a beverage to sweeten it. There are other plant juices used for human food that similarly are not \"vegetable juice\" or \"fruit juice\" for purposes of the juice definition; e.g., maple syrup and sorghum syrup. In summary, our view is that the fluid extract of sugar cane is not the juice of a plant that consumers are accustomed to eating as a vegetable in their diet and is not, therefore, \"juice\" as contemplated by the regulation defining that term (Refs. 1, 3).\n\nFootnote 4: For example, Dictionary.com Unabridged defines \u201cjuice\u201d in relevant part as \u201cthe natural fluid, fluid content, or liquid part that can be extracted from a plant or one of its parts...\u201d http://www.dictionary.com/browse/juice. Retrieved April 25, 2016.\n\nSugar cane is clearly not considered a fruit or vegetable by experts in nutrition and health, nor do those experts consider the fluid extract of sugar cane to be a type of fruit or vegetable juice. Rather, they consider it to be a source of sugar. For example, the Department of Agriculture's Center for Food Policy and Promotion lists \"cane juice\" and \"sugar cane juice\" among the many names for added sugars on its dietary guidance Web site for consumers (Ref. 5).5 A newsletter posted on the Department of Health and Human Services Web site warns that \"cane juice\" is one of the ingredient names used to hide added sugar in beverages and recommends for health reasons that any fruit juice given to children be 100 percent fruit juice without any form of added sugar, including \"cane juice.\"6 Dietary advice on health organization Web sites is similar. For example, the Mayo Clinic Web site lists \"cane juice\" and \"cane syrup\" as forms of added sugar that consumers should cut back on for better health and nutrition.7 None of these Web sites defines sugar cane as a vegetable or classifies the fluid extract of the sugar cane plant as \"juice\" that counts toward the recommended number of daily fruit and vegetable servings.\n\nFootnote 7: Mayo Clinic Staff. \u201cAdded sugars: Don\u2019t get sabotaged by sweeteners.\u201d http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/added-sugar/art-20045328. Retrieved April 25, 2016.\n\nIn FDA's view, the common or usual name for the ingredient currently labeled as \"evaporated cane juice\" includes the term \"sugar\" and does not include the term \"juice.\" The basic nature of the ingredient is that it is a sugar and its characterizing property is that of a sweetener. FDA's food labeling regulations provide that sucrose obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1854 shall be referred to as \"sugar\" in ingredient labeling (21 CFR 101.4(b)(2)). Section 184.1854(a) describes sucrose as the substance \"obtained by crystallization from sugar cane or sugar beet juice that has been extracted by pressing or diffusion, then clarified and evaporated.\" Based on the numerous comments indicating that the ingredient declared as \"evaporated cane juice\" is produced in this manner, it follows that the common or usual name for the product should be or include \"sugar.\" As discussed in the Background section, current names that are used for several other sweeteners made from sugar cane (e.g., turbinado sugar, demerara sugar, and muscovado sugar) are names that have been established by common usage. In each instance, the basic nature of the food is described by use of the term \"sugar.\" FDA would not object to the addition of one or more truthful, non-misleading descriptors before the common or usual name \"sugar.\" Such a descriptor, which could be a coined term, could be used to distinguish the ingredient from white sugar and other sugars on the market by describing characteristics such as source, color, flavor, or crystal size.\n\nSweeteners derived from sugar cane should not be listed in the ingredient declaration by names such as \"evaporated cane juice,\" which suggest that the ingredients are made from or contain fruit or vegetable \"juice\" as defined in 21 CFR 120.1. We consider such representations to be false and misleading under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)) because they do not accurately describe the basic nature of the food and its characterizing properties (i.e., that the ingredients are sugars or syrups), as required by 21 CFR 102.5.\n\nBecause sweeteners derived from sugar cane are not \"juice\" as defined in 21 CFR 120.1, they should not be included in the percentage juice declaration on the labels of beverages that are represented to contain fruit or vegetable juice (see 21 CFR 101.30). Section 101.30 requires the percentage of fruit or vegetable juice in beverages purporting to contain such ingredients to be declared on the label of the beverage. FDA would consider a juice product sweetened with an ingredient derived from sugar cane and labeled as 100% fruit juice to be misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)) because the \"100% fruit juice\" claim is false and misleading in that the product contains a non-juice sweetener in addition to the juice. FDA would also consider such a product adulterated under section 402(b) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 342(b)) because the sweetener has been substituted for part of the juice.\n\nIV.

The identity test(s) can be qualitative in nature. While it is recognized that in most cases a single test is adequate, more than one test (physicochemical, biological, and/or immunochemical) may be necessary to establish identity for some products. Some of the methods typically used for characterization of the product, as described in section II.A and in appendix A, may be employed and/or modified as appropriate for the purpose of establishing identity.\n\niv.2.3 Purity and Impurities (4.2.3)\n\nImpurities may be generated or increased during manufacture and/or storage of the drug product. These may be either the same as those occurring in the drug substance itself, process-related, or degradation products which form specifically in the drug product during formulation or during storage. If impurities are qualitatively and quantitatively (i.e., relative amounts and/or concentrations) the same as in the drug substance, testing is not considered necessary. If impurities are known to be introduced or formed during the production and/or storage of the drug product, the levels of these impurities should be determined and acceptance criteria established.\n\nAcceptance criteria and analytical procedures should be developed and justified, based upon previous experience with the drug product, to measure changes in the drug substance during the manufacture and/or storage of the drug product.\n\nThe choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities including degradation products, and from excipients.\n\nPotency (4.2.4)\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section II.A.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological and biological drug substance and/or drug product. When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug substance, an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment of the drug product. However, the rationale for such a choice should be provided.\n\nQuantity (4.2.5)\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance in the drug product, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n\nGeneral Tests (4.2.6)\n\nPhysical description and the measurement of other quality attributes are often important for the evaluation of the drug product functions. Examples of such tests include pH and osmolarity.\n\nAdditional Testing for Unique Dosage Forms (4.2.7)\n\nIt should be recognized that certain unique dosage forms may need additional tests other than those mentioned above.\n\nGLOSSARY (5.0)\n\nAcceptance criteria: Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures which the drug substance or drug product or materials at other stages of manufacture should meet.\n\nAction limit: An internal (in-house) value used to assess the consistency of the process at less critical steps.\n\nBiological activity: The specific ability or capacity of the product to achieve a defined biological effect. Potency is the quantitative measure of the biological activity.\n\nContaminants: Any adventitiously introduced materials (e.g., chemical, biochemical, or microbial species) not intended to be part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance or drug product.\n\nDegradation products: Molecular variants resulting from changes in the desired product or product-related substances brought about over time and/or by the action of, e.g., light, temperature, pH, water, or by reaction with an excipient and/or the immediate container/closure system. Such changes may occur as a result of manufacture and/or storage (e.g., deamidation, oxidation, aggregation, proteolysis). Degradation products may be either product-related substances or product-related impurities.\n\nDesired product: (1) The protein that has the expected structure, or (2) the protein that is expected from the DNA sequence and anticipated post-translational modification (including glycoforms), and from the intended downstream modification to produce an active biological molecule.\n\nDrug product (Dosage form; Finished product): A pharmaceutical product type that contains a drug substance, generally in association with excipients.\n\nDrug substance (Bulk material): The material that is subsequently formulated with excipients to produce the drug product. It can be composed of the desired product, product-related substances, and product- and process-related impurities. It may also contain excipients including other components, such as buffers.\n\nExipient: An ingredient added intentionally to the drug substance which should not have pharmacological properties in the quantity used.\n\nImpurity: Any component present in the drug substance or drug product that is not the desired product, a product-related substance, or an excipient including buffer components. It may be either process- or product-related.\n\nIn-house primary reference material: An appropriately characterized material prepared by the manufacturer from a representative lot(s) for the purpose of biological assay andphysicochemical testing of subsequent lots, and against which in-house working reference material is calibrated.\n\nIn-house working reference material A material prepared similarly to the primary reference material that is established solely to assess and control subsequent lots for the individual attribute in question. It is always calibrated against the in-house primary reference material.\n\nPotency: The measure of the biological activity using a suitably quantitative biological assay (also called potency assay or bioassay), based on the attribute of the product which is linked to the relevant biological properties.\n\nProcess-related impurities: Impurities that are derived from the manufacturing process. They may be derived from cell substrates (e.g., host cell proteins, host cell DNA), cell culture (e.g., inducers, antibiotics, or media components), or downstream processing (e.g., processing reagents or column leachables).\n\nProduct-related impurities: Molecular variants of the desired product (e.g., precursors, certain degradation products arising during manufacture and/or storage) which do not have properties comparable to those of the desired product with respect to activity, efficacy, and safety.\n\nProduct-related substances: Molecular variants of the desired product formed during manufacture and/or storage which are active and have no deleterious effect on the safety and efficacy of the drug product. These variants possess properties comparable to the desired product and are not considered impurities.\n\nReference standards: International or national standards.\n\nSpecification: A list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a drug substance, drug product, or materials at other stages of its manufacture should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. Conformance to specification means that the drug substance and drug product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the acceptance criteria. Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufacturer and approved by regulatory authorities as conditions of approval.\n\nAppendix A Appendix for Physiochemical Characterization (6.1)\n\nThis appendix provides examples of technical approaches that might be considered for structural characterization and confirmation, and evaluation of physicochemical properties of the desired product, drug substance, and/or drug product. The specific technical approach employed will vary from product to product, and alternative approaches, other than those included in this appendix, will be appropriate in many cases. New analytical technology and modifications to existing technology are continuously being developed and should be utilized when appropriate.\n\n1. Structural Characterization and Confirmation (6.1.1)\n\na. Amino acid sequence\n\nThe amino acid sequence of the desired product should be determined to the extent possible using approaches such as those described in items (b) through (e) and then compared with the sequence of the amino acids deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nb. Amino acid composition\n\nThe overall amino acid composition is determined using various hydrolytic and analytical procedures and compared with the amino acid composition deduced from the gene sequence for the desired product, or the natural counterpart, if considered necessary. In many cases, amino acid composition analysis provides some useful structural information for peptides and small proteins, but such data are generally less definitive for large proteins. Quantitative amino acid analysis data can also be used to determine protein content in many cases.\n\nc. Terminal amino acid sequence\n\nTerminal amino acid analysis is performed to identify the nature and homogeneity of the amino- and carboxy-terminal amino acids. If the desired product is found to be heterogeneous with respect to the terminal amino acids, the relative amounts of the variant forms should be determined using an appropriate analytical procedure. The sequence of these terminal amino acids should be compared with the terminal amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nd.

More than one test (physicochemical, biological and/or immunochemical) may be necessary to establish identity. The identity test(s) can be qualitative in nature. Some of the methods typically used for characterization of the product as described in section 2.1 and in Appendix 6.1 may be employed and/or modified as appropriate for the purpose of establishing identity.\n\n4.1.3 Purity and impurities\n\nThe absolute purity of biotechnological and biological products is difficult to determine and the results are method-dependent (section 2.1.4.). Consequently, the purity of the drug substance is usually estimated by a combination of methods. The choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product from product-related substances and from impurities.\n\nThe impurities observed in these products are classified as process-related and product-related:\n\nProcess-related impurities (section 2.1.4) in the drug substance may include cell culture media, host cell proteins, DNA, monoclonal antibodies or chromatographic media used in purification, solvents and buffer components. These impurities should be minimized by the use of appropriate well-controlled manufacturing processes.\n\nProduct-related impurities (section 2.1.4) in the drug substance are molecular variants with properties different from those of the desired product formed during manufacture and/or storage.\n\nFor the impurities, the choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities. Individual and/or collective acceptance criteria for impurities should be set, as appropriate. Under certain circumstances, acceptance criteria for selected impurities may not be required (section 2.3).\n\n4.1.4 Potency\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section 2.1.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological or biological drug substance and/or drug product. When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug product (section 4.2.4), an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment at the drug substance stage. In some cases, the measurement of specific activity may provide additional useful information.\n\n4.1.5 Quantity\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. The quantity determination may be independent of a reference standard or material. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6B Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.474105954170227", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: 152 Specificity / Selectivity\n\n153 The specificity or selectivity of an analytical procedure can be demonstrated through absence of interference, comparison of results to an orthogonal procedure or may be inherently given by the underlying scientific principles of the analytical procedure. Some experiments can be combined with accuracy studies.\n\n157 Selectivity could be demonstrated when the analytical procedure is not specific. However, the test for an analyte to be identified or quantified in the presence of potential interference should minimize that interference and prove that the test is fit for purpose.\n\n160 Where one analytical procedure does not provide sufficient discrimination, a combination of two or more procedures is recommended to achieve the necessary level of selectivity.\n\n162 4.1.1 Absence of interference\n\n163 Specificity/selectivity can be shown by demonstrating that the identification and/or quantitation of an analyte is not impacted by the presence of other substances (e.g., impurities, degradation products, related substances, matrix, or other components present in the operating environment).\n\n167 4.1.2 Orthogonal procedure comparison\n\n168 Specificity/selectivity can be verified by demonstrating that the measured result of an analyte is comparable to the measured result of a second, well characterized analytical procedure (e.g., an orthogonal procedure).\n\n169 4.1.3 Technology inherent justification\n\n170 In some cases where the specificity of the analytical technology can be ensured and predicted by technical parameters (e.g., resolution of isotopes in mass spectrometry, chemical shifts of NMR signals), no experimental study may be required, if justified.\n\n171 4.1.4 Recommended Data\n\n172 4.1.4.1 Identification\n\n173 For identification tests, a critical aspect is to demonstrate the capability to identify the analyte of interest based on unique aspects of its molecular structure and/or other specific properties.\n\n179 The capability of an analytical procedure to identify an analyte can be confirmed by obtaining positive results comparable to a known reference material with samples containing the analyte, along with negative results from samples which do not contain the analyte. In addition, the identification test can be applied to materials structurally similar to or closely related to the analyte to confirm that an undesired positive response is not obtained. The choice of such potentially interfering materials should be based on scientific judgement with a consideration of any interference that could occur.\n\n186 4.1.4.2 Assay, purity- and impurity test(s)\n\n187 The specificity/selectivity of an analytical procedure should be demonstrated to fulfil the accuracy requirements for the content or potency of an analyte in the sample.\n\n189 Representative data (e.g., chromatograms, electropherograms or spectra) should be used to demonstrate specificity and individual components should be appropriately labelled.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q2-R2_Document_Step2_Guideline_2022_0324\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.05576159805059433", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: All relevant data collected during validation and formulae used for calculating validation characteristics should be submitted and discussed as appropriate.\n\nApproaches other than those set forth in this guideline may be applicable and acceptable. It is the responsibility of the applicant to choose the validation procedure and protocol most suitable for their product. However it is important to remember that the main objective of validation of an analytical procedure is to demonstrate that the procedure is suitable for its intended purpose. Due to their complex nature, analytical procedures for biological and biotechnological products in some cases may be approached differently than in this document.\n\nWell-characterized reference materials, with documented purity, should be used throughout the validation study. The degree of purity necessary depends on the intended use.\n\nIn accordance with the parent document, and for the sake of clarity, this document considers the various validation characteristics in distinct sections. The arrangement of these sections reflects the process by which an analytical procedure may be developed and evaluated.\n\nIn practice, it is usually possible to design the experimental work such that the appropriate validation characteristics can be considered simultaneously to provide a sound, overall knowledge of the capabilities of the analytical procedure, for instance: specificity, linearity, range, accuracy and precision.\n\n1 Specificity\n\nAn investigation of specificity should be conducted during the validation of identification tests, the determination of impurities and the assay. The procedures used to demonstrate specificity will depend on the intended objective of the analytical procedure.\n\nIt is not always possible to demonstrate that an analytical procedure is specific for a particular analyte (complete discrimination). In this case a combination of two ormore analytical procedures is recommended to achieve the necessary level of discrimination.\n\nIdentification\n\nSuitable identification tests should be able to discriminate between compounds of closely related structures which are likely to be present. The discrimination of a procedure may be confirmed by obtaining positive results (perhaps by comparison with a known reference material) from samples containing the analyte, coupled with negative results from samples which do not contain the analyte. In addition, the identification test may be applied to materials structurally similar to or closely related to the analyte to confirm that a positive response is not obtained. The choice of such potentially interfering materials should be based on sound scientific judgement with a consideration of the interferences that could occur.\n\nAssay and Impurity Test(s)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q2(R1) Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.1816309541463852", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: a) Description: a qualitative statement about the state (e.g. solid, liquid) and color of the new drug substance. If any of these characteristics change during storage, this change should be investigated and appropriate action taken.\n\nb) Identification: identification testing should optimally be able to discriminate between compounds of closely related structure which are likely to be present. Identification tests should be specific for the new drug substance, e.g., infrared spectroscopy. Identification solely by a single chromatographic retention time, for example, is not regarded as being specific. However, the use of two chromatographic procedures, where the separation is based on different principles or a combination of tests into a single procedure, such as HPLC/UV diode array, HPLC/MS, or GC/MS is generally acceptable. If the new drugsubstance is a salt, identification testing should be specific for the individual ions. An identification test that is specific for the salt itself should suffice. Identification should be retained in the specification; however testing during a stability study is not recommended unless the identification test is stability indicating.\n\nNew drug substances which are optically active may also call for specific identification testing or performance of a chiral assay. Please refer to 3.3.1.d in this Guidance for further discussion of this topic.\n\nc) Assay: A specific, stability-indicating procedure should be included to determine the content of the new drug substance. In many cases it is possible to employ the same procedure (e.g., HPLC) for both assay of the new drug substance and quantitation of impurities.\n\nIn cases where use of a non-specific assay is justified, other supporting analytical procedures should be used to achieve overall specificity. For example, where titration is adopted to assay the drug substance, the combination of the assay and a suitable test for impurities should be used.\n\nd) Impurities: Organic and inorganic impurities and residual solvents are included in this category. Refer to the VICH GL18 Guidances Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances and Residual Solvents in New Veterinary Medicinal Products, Active Substances and Excipients for detailed information.\n\nDecision tree #1 addresses the extrapolation of meaningful limits on impurities from the body of data generated during development. At the time of filing it is unlikely that sufficient data will be available to assess process consistency. Therefore it is not recommended to establish acceptance criteria which tightly encompass the batch data at the time of filing. (see section 2.5)\n\n3.2.2 New Medicinal Products\n\nThe following tests and acceptance criteria are considered generally applicable to all new medicinal products:\n\na) Description: A qualitative description of the dosage form should be provided (e.g., size, shape, and color). If any of these characteristics change during manufacture or storage, this change should be investigated and appropriate action taken. The acceptance criteria should include the final acceptable appearance. If color changes during storage, a quantitative procedure may be appropriate.\n\nb) Identification: Identification testing should establish the identity of the new drug substance(s) in the new medicinal product and should be able to discriminate between compounds of closely related structure which are likely to be present. Identity tests should be specific for the new drug substance, e.g., infrared spectroscopy. Identification solely by a single chromatographic retention time, for example, is not regarded as being specific. However, the use of two chromatographic procedures, where the separation is based on different principles, or combination of tests into a single procedure, such as HPLC/UV diode array, HPLC/MS, or GC/MS, is generally acceptable. Identification should be retained in the specification; however testing during a stability study is not recommended unless the identification test is stability indicating.\n\nc) Assay: A specific, stability-indicating assay to determine strength (content) should be included for all new medicinal products. In many cases it is possible to employ the same procedure (e.g., HPLC) for both assay of the new drug substance and quantitation of impurities. Results of content uniformity testing for new medicinal products can be used for quantitation of medicinal product strength, if the methods used for content uniformity are also appropriate as assays.\n\nIn cases where use of a non-specific assay is justified, other supporting analytical procedures should be used to achieve overall specificity. For example, where titration is adopted to assay the drug substance for release, the combination of the assay and a suitable test for impurities can be used. A specific procedure should be used when there is evidence of excipient interference with the non-specific assay.\n\nd) Impurities: Organic and inorganic impurities (degradation products) and residual solvents are included in this category. Refer to the VICH GL18 Guidances Impurities in New Veterinary Medicinal Products and Residual Solvents for detailed information. Organic impurities arising from degradation of the new drug substance and impurities that arise during the manufacturing process for the medicinal product should be monitored in the new medicinal product. Acceptance limits should be stated for individual specified degradation products, which may include both identified and unidentified degradation products as appropriate, and total degradation products. Process impurities from the new drug substance synthesis are normally controlled during drug substance testing, and therefore are not included in the total impurities limit. However, when a synthesis impurity is also a degradation product, its level should be monitored and included in the total degradation product limit. When it has been conclusively demonstrated via appropriate analytical methodology, that the drug substance does not degrade in the specific formulation, and under the specific storage conditions proposed in the new drug application, degradation product testing may be reduced or eliminated upon approval by the regulatory authorities.\n\nDecision tree #2 addresses the extrapolation of meaningful limits on degradation products from the body of data generated during development. At the time of filing it is unlikely that sufficient data will be available to assess process consistency. Therefore it is not recommended to establish acceptance criteria which tightly encompass the batch data at the time of filing. (see section 2.5)\n\nSpecific Tests / Criteria\n\nIn addition to the universal tests listed above, the following tests may be considered on a case by case basis for drug substances and/or medicinal products. Individual tests/criteria should be included in the specification when the tests have an impact on the quality of the drug substance and medicinal product for batch control. Tests other than those listed below may be recommended in particular situations or as new information becomes available.\n\n3.3.1 New Drug Substances\n\na) Physicochemical properties: These are properties such as pH of an aqueous solution, melting point / range, and refractive index. The procedures used for the measurement of these properties are usually unique and do not need much elaboration, e.g., capillary melting point, Abbe refracometry. The tests performed in this category should be determined by the physical nature of the new drug substance and by its intended use.\n\nb) Particle size: For some new drug substances intended for use in solid or suspension medicinal products, particle size can have a significant effect on dissolution rates, bioavailability, residue depletion if appropriate and/or stability. In such instances, testing for particle size distribution should be carried out using an appropriate procedure, and acceptance criteria should be provided.\n\n3.3.2 Conclusions\n\nDecision tree #3 provides additional guidance on when particle size testing should be considered.\n\nc) Polymorphic forms: Some new drug substances exist in different crystalline forms which differ in their physical properties. Polymorphism may also include solvation or hydration products (also known as pseudopolymers) and amorphous forms. Differences in these forms could, in some cases, affect the quality or performance of the new medicinal products. In cases where differences exist which have been shown to affect medicinal product performance, bioavailability, residue depletion if appropriate, or stability, then the appropriate solid state should be specified.\n\nPhysicochemical measurements and techniques are commonly used to determine whether multiple forms exist. Examples of these procedures are: melting point (including hot-stage microscopy), solid state IR, X-ray powder diffraction, thermal analysis procedures (like DSC, TGA and DTA), Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and solid state NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy.\n\nDecision trees #4(1) through 4(3) provide additional guidance on when, and how, polymorphic forms should be monitored and controlled.\n\nNote: These decision trees should be followed sequentially. Trees 1 and 2 consider whether polymorphism is exhibited by the drug substance, and whether the different polymorphic forms can affect performance of the medicinal product. Tree 3 should only be applied when polymorphism has been demonstrated for the drug substance, and shown to affect these properties. Tree 3 considers the potential for change in polymorphic forms in the medicinal product, and whether such a change has any effect on product performance.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #176 (VICH GL39) Specifications- Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Veterinary Drug Substances and New Medicinal Products- Chemical Substances \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.621757447719574", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: This definition has the following implications:\n\nIdentification: To ensure the identity of an analyte.\n\nPurity Tests: To ensure that all the analytical procedures performed allow an accurate statement of the content of impurities of an analyte, i.e., related substances test, heavy metals, residual solvents content, etc.\n\nAssay (content or potency):\n\nTo provide an exact result which allows an accurate statement on the content or potency of the analyte in a sample.\n\n3 Accuracy\n\nThe accuracy of an analytical procedure expresses the closeness of agreement between the value which is accepted either as a conventional true value or an accepted reference value and the value found.\n\nThis is sometimes termed trueness.\n\nPrecision\n\nThe precision of an analytical procedure expresses the closeness of agreement (degree of scatter) between a series of measurements obtained from multiple sampling of the same homogeneous sample under the prescribed conditions. Precision may be considered at three levels: repeatability, intermediate precision and reproducibility.\n\nPrecision should be investigated using homogeneous, authentic samples. However, if it is not possible to obtain a homogeneous sample it may be investigated using artificially prepared samples or a sample solution.\n\nThe precision of an analytical procedure is usually expressed as the variance, standard deviation or coefficient of variation of a series of measurements.\n\na. Repeatability\n\nRepeatability expresses the precision under the same operating conditions over a short interval of time. Repeatability is also termed intra-assay precision\n\nb.

Reproducibility\n\nReproducibility expresses the precision between laboratories (collaborative studies usually applied to standardization of methodology).\n\n5. DETECTION LIMIT\n\nThe detection limit of an individual analytical procedure is the lowest amount of analyte in a sample which can be detected but not necessarily quantitated as an exact value.\n\n6. QUANTITATION LIMIT\n\nThe quantitation limit of an individual analytical procedure is the lowest amount of analyte in a sample which can be quantitatively determined with suitable precision and accuracy. The quantitation limit is a parameter of quantitative assays for low levels of compounds in sample matrices, and is used particularly for the determination of impurities and/or degradation products.\n\n7 Linearity\n\nThe linearity of an analytical procedure is its ability (within a given range) to obtain test results which are directly proportional to the concentration (amount) of analyte in the sample.\n\n8 Range\n\nThe range of an analytical procedure is the interval between the upper and lower concentration (amounts) of analyte in the sample (including these concentrations) for which it has been demonstrated that the analytical procedure has a suitable level of precision, accuracy and linearity.\n\n9 Robustness\n\nThe robustness of an analytical procedure is a measure of its capacity to remain unaffected by small, but deliberate variations in method parameters and provides an indication of its reliability during normal usage.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q2A Text on Validation of Analytical Procedures \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6790672540664673"], "In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Clinical Policy\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nAugust 2023\n\nGood Clinical Practice\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]\n\nInformed Consent\n\nGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance document was developed by the Office of Clinical Policy (OCIIP), in coordination with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details).

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance1 describes FDA implementation of the revised provisions applicable to the request for, and issuance of, a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) (Public Law 114-255) amended the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), section 301(d) (42 U.S.C. 241(d)) relating to the issuance of CoCs. A CoC is intended to help protect the privacy of human subject research participants from whom identifiable, sensitive information is being collected or used in furtherance of the research.2 Historically, a CoC generally protected a researcher from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive information about the research participant, created or compiled for purposes of the human subject research. As amended, the statute broadened the protections by affirmatively prohibiting holders of CoCs from disclosing such information unless a specific exception applies.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Policy in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Tobacco Products, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the Center for Veterinary Medicine, and the Office of Chief Scientist at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFootnote 2: There are additional statutes and regulations that protect the privacy of human subject research participants. These are outside the scope of this guidance.\n\nThe Cures Act simplified certain aspects of the issuance of CoCs by requiring that CoCs be issued for federally-funded human subject research that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive information (referred to in this guidance as mandatory CoCs). For non-federally funded research, issuance of CoCs is not required but may be issued at the discretion of FDA (referred to in this guidance as discretionary CoCs). FDA intends to continue receiving and considering such requests and will issue discretionary CoCs as appropriate. This guidance is intended to provide information on how to request a discretionary CoC, the statutory requirements for requesting such a CoC, and the statutory responsibilities associated with possessing a CoC. Although the mandatory CoC and the discretionary CoC are issued under different processes, the protectionsafforded by the issuance of either CoC are identical and the statutory responsibilities are the same.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nA CoC generally protects a researcher from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive information about the research participant, created or compiled for purposes of the research, in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding. As amended, the statute broadened these protections by prohibiting disclosure of such information. By protecting researchers from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive information about the research participants, CoCs help protect the identity of the research participants and achieve the objectives of the research. There are exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure as described in Section 3 of this guidance.\n\nFDA has the authority (by delegation) to issue CoCs related to the study of products subject to FDA jurisdiction and to which FDA regulations apply, in compliance with the PHS Act, and has done so for over 20 years. (42 U.S.C. SS 241)3 The Cures Act revisions made issuance of a CoC mandatory for federally funded researchers \"engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research, in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected (including research on mental health and research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs).\" For non-federally funded research, FDA \"may, upon application by a person engaged in research, issue to such person a certificate of confidentiality to protect the privacy of such individuals (emphases added)...\"\n\nFootnote 3: FDA, by delegation from the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has the authority to issue CoCs. (See, FDA Staff Manual Guide, 1410.26(1)(E)). Other HHS agencies, e.g., National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also issue CoCs.\n\nThe Cures Act also directed agencies to take steps to minimize the burden to researchers, streamline the process, and reduce the time it takes to comply with the requirements of the statutory provision. FDA has complied with this directive in implementing requirements for the issuance of mandatory CoCs to FDA-federally funded researchers.\n\nFor non-federally funded research, FDA has been issuing discretionary CoCs pursuant to the amended statutory requirements, on a case-by-case basis upon application to FDA, since enactment of the Cures Act. This guidance describes the revised, streamlined process for submission to FDA of requests for discretionary CoCs for non-federally funded research. The revised process for discretionary CoCs will minimize the burden to researchers who request a CoC, will streamline the existing process by reducing the information currently provided in a request to FDA for a CoC, will clarify the statutory responsibilities associated with receiving a CoC and, thus, will reduce the time it takes to obtain a CoC.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nTo help ensure that discretionary CoCs are issued to those entities who can comply with the requirements of the statutory provision, we recommend that only sponsors or sponsor- investigators, submit requests for discretionary CoCs (as defined in 21 CFR SS50.3, SS312.3, SS812.3) (i.e., the individual who takes responsibility for or initiates the clinical investigation). This will help eliminate duplicative requests to FDA for the same human subject research. It is our understanding that, typically, sponsors and sponsor-investigators are the entities or individuals who have responsibility and control over the information and data collected and used in research. Furthermore, the human subject research, for which a discretionary CoC is being requested, must involve the use or study of a product subject to FDA's jurisdiction and must be subject to FDA's regulatory authority.\n\nThe term \"identifiable, sensitive information,\" as used in section 301(d), PHS Act, and in relation to CoCs, means \"information that is about an individual and that is gathered or used during the course of research\" covered by the statute and\n\n(A) through which an individual is identified; or (B) for which there is at least a very small risk, as determined by current scientific practices or statistical methods, that some combination of the information, a request for the information, and other available data sources could be used to deduce the identity of an individual.\n--------------------\nContext title: Certificates of Confidentiality Guidance for Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators, Researchers, Industry, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.02595691755414009", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Form FDA 3674 - Certifications To Accompany Drug, Biological Product, and Device Applications/Submissions:\n\nGUIDANCE FOR SPONSORS, INDUSTRY, RESEARCHERS, INVESTIGATORS, AND FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION STAFF\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice, Office of Special Medical Programs\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nWO Bldg. 32, Room 5172\n\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\n\nSilver Spring, MD, 20993-0002\n\n301-796-8340\n\ngcp.questions@fda.hhs.gov\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice, Office of Special Medical Programs\n\nRevised June 2017\n\nOMB Control No. 0910-0616\n\nSee additional PRA statement in Section IV of this guidance.\n\nForm FDA 3674 - Certifications To Accompany Drug, Biological Product, and Device Applications/Submissions\n\nGuidance for Sponsors, Industry, Researchers, Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.

(\\lx@sectionsign) 282(j)(5)(B). Section 402(j) of the PHS Act was added by Title VIII, Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) (Public Law 110-85).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable rights or responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nTitle VIII, FDAAA, amended the PHS Act by adding section 402(j), 42 U.S.C. SS 282(j). The provisions require that additional information be submitted to the clinical trials data bank (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) operated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Library of Medicine (NLM), including expanded information on clinical trials and summary information regarding the results of clinical trials.\n\nOne provision, 42 U.S.C. SS 282(j)(5)(B), section 402(j)(5)(B) of the PHS Act, requires that a certification accompany certain human drug, biological product, and device applications and submissions to FDA. The provision reads as follows:\n\n(B) CERTIFICATION TO ACCOMPANY DRUG, BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT, AND DEVICE SUBMISSIONS.--At the time of submission of an application under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, section 515 of such Act, section 520(m) of such Act, or section 351 of this Act, or submission of a report under section 510(k) of such Act, such application or submission shall be accompanied by a certification that all applicable requirements of this subsection have been met. Where available, such certification\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nshall include the appropriate National Clinical Trial control numbers.\n\nThe certification requirement went into effect on December 26, 2007. To assist sponsors, industry, researchers, and investigators in complying with the requirement, we created a certification form (Form FDA 3674) to be used to satisfy the certification requirement. The Form FDA 3674 can be obtained at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/default.htm\n\nIII. Purpose and Agency Recommendations\n\nWe received numerous inquiries asking whether various kinds of information and documents that sponsors, industry, researchers, and investigators submit to FDA must be accompanied by the certification (Form FDA 3674). We also have experience with the submission of certifications since the form was implemented in December 2007. This guidance provides FDA's current thinking, for purposes of continued implementation of Title VIII of FDAAA,1 regarding specific types of applications and submissions submitted to FDA under section 505, 515, 520(m), or 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), or under section 351 of the PHS Act, and accompanying certifications described in section 402(j)(5)(B), 42 U.S.C $ 282(j)(5)(B).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe purpose of Title VIII, FDAAA, is to provide a means for ensuring that the public has access to information about certain clinical trials.2 Specifically, Title VIII is intended to provide a mechanism for the public to learn about certain clinical trials that are being conducted, as well as summary results information of those trials. In determining its current thinking on specific applications and submissions submitted under the statutory sections cited above and submission of accompanying certifications, FDA has focused on the role the certification plays in helping achieve the purposes of Title VIII, FDAAA.\n\nFootnote 2: Since implementation of the Form FDA 3674, FDA has promulgated 21 CFR \u00a7 50.25(c), requiring a statement in certain informed consent documents concerning the submission of information to the databank at www,ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, on September 21, 2016, NIH published a Final Rule implementing section 402(j) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 282(j)) (see, 42 CFR part 11). The Final Rule does not include provisions related to this FDA certification other than identifying potential enforcement penalties for failure to comply with section 402(j) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 282(j)) (see, 42 CFR 11.66).\n\nOne purpose of the certification is to require the submitter to confirm compliance with all applicable requirements of Title VIII, including applicable implementing regulations, e.g., the requirement to register applicable clinical trials.3 Failure to submit a certification, knowingly submitting a false certification, failure to submit required clinical trial information, and submission of clinical trial information that is false or misleading are all prohibited acts under section 301(jj) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(jj)).4 Requiring a certification (Form FDA 3674) to accompany certain applications and submissions submitted to FDA is, therefore, one way of encouraging compliance with the provisions of the law and any applicable implementing regulations.\n\nFootnote 3: \u201cApplicable clinical trial\u201d is defined at section 402(j)(1)(A)(i) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 282(j)(1)(A)(i)) and at 42 CFR 11.10. For additional information, visit http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe certification (Form FDA 3674) also facilitates FDA's exercise of its responsibilities under the law. For example, as stated previously, FDAAA created four prohibited acts relating to compliance with the requirements of Title VIII, including compliance with the requirement to submit a certification. The certification requirement is critical to our ability to determine whether the law has been complied with and whether an enforcement action is appropriate. In addition, section 402(j)(3)(F) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. SS 282(j)(3)(F)) requires FDA to notify the Director of NIH of certain actions taken on applications and reports that were accompanied by a certification. The notification alerts NIH to the fact that the responsible party must submit summary results information for the trials within a certain period of time, thereby assisting NIH in the exercise of its responsibilities under Title VIII. The information provided in the certification form helps us assist NIH in \"linking\" information posted on FDA's website regarding certain FDA regulatory actions to specific applicable clinical trials included in the registry and results databases. This linking, using the information in Form FDA 3674, particularly the NCT (National Clinical Trial) number(s) required in the form, allows FDA to help the public more easily correlate various reports, medical reviews, advisories, health alerts, advisory committee actions, and other materials with specific applicable clinical trials registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov and identified by the NCT number.\n\nNew drug applications (NDAs), supplemental NDAs, biologics license applications (BLAs), supplemental BLAs, abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), premarket approval applications (PMAs), PMA \"panel track\" supplements, humanitarian device exemptions (HDEs), and resubmissions of these, are all \"applications\" under their respective sections of the FD&CAct or the PHS Act. Similarly, 510(k)s are \"submissions of a report\" under that section of the FD&C Act. Thus, all of these specified applications and submissions fall within the plain language of the statutory provision. Additionally, these all represent the initiation of the regulatory review process through which clinical investigations supporting approval of a previously unapproved medical product are submitted to FDA for marketing approval of that product. Because amendments to pending applications, pending supplemental applications, or pending submissions of 510(k)s are not independently \"applications\" or \"submissions of a report under 510(k),\" such amendments need not be accompanied by a certification (Form FDA 3674).\n\nWe concluded that the statutory requirement to submit a certification also applies to investigational new drug applications (INDs) and the submissions of new protocols to INDs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Form FDA 3674 - Certifications To Accompany Drug, Biological Product, and Device Applications:Submissions Guidance for Sponsors, Industry, Researchers, Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.0428805351257324", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nConduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Bards\n\nMarch 2020\n\nUpdated on August 30, 2021\n\nFor questions on clinical trial conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic, please email\n\nClinicaltrialconduct-COVID19@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n\nOncology Center of Excellence (OCE)\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice (OGCP)\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nThis guidance is being issued to address the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide general considerations to assist sponsors in assuring the safety of trial participants,1 maintaining compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), and minimizing risks to trial integrity for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in January 2021 (previous versions December, September, July, June, May, April, and March 2020). The appendix to this guidance further explains those general considerations by providing answers to questions that the Agency has received about conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020 (85 FR 16949), titled \"Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019,\" available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.\n\nThe contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3\n\nFootnote 2: Secretary of Health and Human Services, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists (originally issued Jan. 31, 2020, and subsequently renewed), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nFootnote 3: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nFDA recognizes that the COVID-19 public health emergency may impact the conduct of clinical trials of medical products. Challenges may arise, for example, from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, interruptions to the supply chain for the investigational product,4 or other considerations if site personnel or trial participants become infected with COVID-19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol-specified procedures, includingadministering or using the investigational product or adhering to protocol-mandated visits and laboratory/diagnostic testing. FDA recognizes that protocol modifications may be required, and that there may be unavoidable protocol deviations due to COVID-19 illness and/or COVID-19 public health control measures. Although the necessity for, and impact of, COVID-19 public health control measures on trials will vary depending on many factors, including the nature of disease under study, the trial design, and in what region(s) the study is being conducted, FDA outlines the following general considerations to assist sponsors in assuring the safety of trial participants, maintaining compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), and minimizing risks to trial integrity. The appendix further explains those general considerations by providing answers to questions about conducting clinical trials that the Agency has received during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nConsiderations for ongoing trials:\n\nEnsuring the safety of trial participants is paramount. Sponsors should consider each circumstance, focusing on the potential impact on the safety of trial participants, and modify study conduct accordingly. Study decisions may include those regarding continuing trial recruitment, continuing use of the investigational product for patients already participating in the trial, and the need to change patient monitoring during the trial. In all cases, it is critical that trial participants are kept informed of changes to the study and monitoring plans that could impact them.\n\nSponsors, in consultation with clinical investigators and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), may determine that the protection of a participant's safety, welfare, and rights is best served by continuing a study participant in the trial as per the protocol or by discontinuing the administration or use of the investigational product or even participation in the trial. Such decisions will depend on specific circumstances, including the nature of the investigational product, the ability to conduct appropriate safety monitoring, the potential impact on the investigational product supply chain, and the nature of the disease under study in the trial.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8763703107833862"], "As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: II IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have \"... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....\"\n\n14. When IRB members cannot attend a convened meeting, may they send someone from their department to vote for them?No. Alternates who are formally appointed and listed in the membership roster may substitute, but ad hoc substitutes are not permissible as members of an IRB. However, a member who is unable to be present at the convened meeting may participate by video-conference or conference telephone call, when the member has received a copy of the documents that are to be reviewed at the meeting. Such members may vote and be counted as part of the quorum. If allowed by IRB procedures, ad hoc substitutes may attend as consultants and gather information for the absent member, but they may not be counted toward the quorum or participate in either deliberation or voting with the board. The IRB may, of course, ask questions of this representative just as they could of any non-member consultant. Opinions of the absent members that are transmitted by mail, telephone, telefax or e-mail may be considered by the attending IRB members but may not be counted as votes or the quorum for convened meetings.\n\n15 May the IRB use alternate members?\n\nThe use of formally appointed alternate IRB members is acceptable to the FDA, provided that the IRB's written procedures describe the appointment and function of alternate members. The IRB roster should identify the primary member(s) for whom each alternate member may substitute. To ensure maintaining an appropriate quorum, the alternate's qualifications should be comparable to the primary member to be replaced. The IRB minutes should document when an alternate member replaces a primary member. When alternates substitute for a primary member, the alternate member should have received and reviewed the same material that the primary member received or would have received.\n\n16 Does a non-affiliated member need to attend every IRB meeting?\n\nNo. Although 21 CFR 56.108(c) does not specifically require the presence of a member not otherwise affiliated with the institution to constitute a quorum, FDA considers the presence of such members an important element of the IRB's diversity. Therefore, frequent absence of all non-affiliated members is not acceptable to FDA. Acknowledging their important role, many IRBs have appointed more than one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. FDA encourages IRBs to appoint members in accordance with 21 CFR 56.107(a) who will be able to participate fully in the IRB process.\n\n17 Which IRB members should be considered to be scientists and non-scientists?\n\n21 CFR 56.107(c) requires at least one member of the IRB to have primary concerns in the scientific area and at least one to have primary concerns in the non-scientific area. Most IRBs include physicians and Ph.D. level physical or biological scientists. Such members satisfy the requirement for at least one scientist. When an IRB encounters studies involving science beyond the expertise of the members, the IRB may use a consultant to assist in the review, as provided by 21 CFR 56.107(f).\n\nFDA believes the intent of the requirement for diversity of disciplines was to include members who had little or no scientific or medical training or experience. Therefore, nurses, pharmacists and other biomedical health professionals should not be regarded to have \"primary concerns in the non-scientific area.\" In the past, lawyers, clergy and ethicists have been cited as examples of persons whose primary concerns would be in non-scientific areas.\n\nSome members have training in both scientific and non-scientific disciplines, such as a J.D., R.N. While such members are of great value to an IRB, other members who are unambiguously non-scientific should be appointed to satisfy the non-scientist requirement.\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\n18. The FDA regulations [21 CFR 56.104(c)] exempt an emergency use of a test article from prospective IRB review, however, \"... any subsequent use of the test article at the institution is subject to IRB review.\" What does the phrase \"subsequent use\" mean?\n\nFDA regulations allow for one emergency use of a test article in an institution without prospective IRB review, provided that such emergency use is reported to the IRB within five working days after such use. An emergency use is defined as a single use (or single course of treatment, e.g., multiple doses of antibiotic) with one subject. \"Subsequent use\" would be a second use with that subject or the use with another subject.\n\nIn its review of the emergency use, if it is anticipated that the test article may be used again, the IRB should request a protocol and consent document(s) be developed so that an approved protocol would be in place when the next need arises. In spite of the best efforts of the clinical investigator and the IRB, a situation may occur where a second emergency use needs to be considered. FDA believes it is inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to an individual when the only obstacle is lack of time for the IRB to convene, review the use and give approval.\n\n19. Are there any regulations that require clinical investigators to report to the IRB when a study has been completed?\n\nIRBs are required to function under written procedures. One of these procedural requirements [21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)] requires ensuring \"prompt reporting to the IRB of changes in a research activity.\" The completion of the study is a change in activity and should be reported to the IRB. Although subjects will no longer be \"at risk\" under the study, a final report/notice to the IRB allows it to close its files as well as providing information that may be used by the IRB in the evaluation and approval of related studies.\n\n20. What is expedited review?\n\nExpedited review is a procedure through which certain kinds of research may be reviewed and approved without convening a meeting of the IRB. The Agency's IRB regulations [21 CFR 56.110] permit, but do not require, an IRB to review certain categories of research through an exedited procedure if the research involves no more than minimal risk. A list of categories was last published in the Federal Register on January 27, 1981 [46 FR 8980].\n\nThe IRB may also use the expedited review procedure to review minor changes in previously approved research during the period covered by the original approval. Under an expedited review procedure, review of research may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced members of the IRB designated by the chairperson. The reviewer(s) may exercise all the authorities of the IRB, except disapproval. Research may only be disapproved following review by the full committee. The IRB is required to adopt a method of keeping all members advised of research studies that have been approved by expedited review.\n\n[See Conditions for IRB Use of Expedited Review - Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216), Notices (/about-fda/page-not-found)]\n\n21. The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a \"primary reviewer\" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe \"primary reviewer\" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 8.034974098205566", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.8260207772254944", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: This formal review of the research effort, as required under 21 CFR 56.109(f), is the subject of this guidance. An IRB must review previously approved research at least once a year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). Review must be conducted at convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, unless the research qualifies for review through an expedited process (21 CFR 56.108(c) and 56.110). See Section III.D. of this guidance for more information on the application of expedited review procedures to continuing review.\n\nIRBs involved in multi-site studies may find it difficult to conduct a thorough review with data solely from the site(s) under their purview and may need to obtain study-wide information. Sponsors are in the unique position of having information for the entire study6 and may provide it to investigators, who in turn provide it to the IRBs. FDA's regulations do not prohibit sponsors from providing study-wide information directly to IRBs.7 FDA encourages efforts by investigators and sponsors to ensure that IRBs receive meaningful study-wide information, particularly when doing so may assist IRBs in reviewing the studies and protecting subjects.\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cAdverse Event Reporting to IRBs \u2013 Improving Human Subject Protection,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126572.pdf.\n\nFootnote 7: Note that FDA\u2019s regulations for device studies specifically assign general responsibility to sponsors \u201c...for ensuring IRB review and approval are obtained and ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation...\u201d 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nOne way to enable a useful continuing review of multi-site studies while reducing or eliminating duplication of effort is through the use of cooperative review agreements or other mechanisms (e.g., using a centralized IRB review process), in accordance with 21 CFR 56.114. Cooperative agreements may vary with respect to how continuing review will be carried out. For example, some agreements may designate a specific IRB as having primary responsibility for continuing review of an investigation.8 Other agreements may assign responsibility for local issues to the institution's IRB, but assign the remaining aspects of continuing review to a central IRB.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cUsing a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080606.pdf.\n\nWhatever the arrangement, the IRB(s) responsible for continuing review of multi-site studies may find it helpful to obtain and review information across the entire study. For additional discussion, see Section III.B. of this guidance.\n\nAppendix A Criteria for Approving Research During Continuing Review\n\nFDA regulations set forth the criteria for IRB approval of research (21 CFR 56.111). These criteria apply to both initial review and continuing review. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of following requirements are satisfied:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized;\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result;\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable;\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and appropriately documented;\n\nWhere appropriate, the research plan adequately provides for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects;\n\nWhere appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data;\n\nAppropriate additional safeguards are included to protect vulnerable subjects; and\n\nWhere the study involves children, the research complies with 21 CFR part 50, Subpart D.\n\nThe IRB makes its continuing review determination by considering whether any new information is available that would affect the IRB's prior finding that the research meets the criteria in 21 CFR 56.111. IRBs have authority to disapprove or require modifications in (to secure re- approval of) a research activity that does not meet any of the above criteria (e.g., the full study or any part thereof, such as changes to the protocol, advertisements; 21 CFR 56.109(a))\n\nAppendix B Process for Conducting Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review takes place at a convened meeting of the IRB, unless it meets the criteria for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110. (See 21 CFR 56.108(c) and Section III.D. of this guidance.) The IRB is required to review the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)) and must maintain records of its continuing review activities, including minutes of meetings at which such activities are undertaken (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) and (3)). The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show actions taken by the IRB, and the vote on these actions, and to summarize the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For research to be approved, a majority of IRB members present at a meeting must approve it (21 CFR 56.108(c)).\n\nThe IRB must ensure that a member does not participate in the IRB's continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB (21 CFR 56.107(e)). Meeting minutes must reflect meeting attendance, the votes taken, and a summary of the discussion and resolution of controverted issues, and should provide confirmation that conflicted members did not participate in the IRB's continuing review of their studies (21 CFR 56.115((a)(2)). FDA recommends that IRB members with a conflicting interest in a project recuse themselves by leaving the meeting room when the IRB conducts continuing review of that project, except when requested by the IRB to be present to provide information.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis IRB member recusal should be noted in the minutes of the IRB meeting when recording votes on IRB actions.\n\nAn IRB must maintain and follow written procedures for the continuing review of research (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) and 56.115(a)(6)). In developing procedures for continuing review, the IRB should consider the use of templates, checklists, or other tools to standardize the request for information or list of materials to be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that studies they conduct comply with applicable regulatory requirements.9 To ensure that the reviewing IRB can carry out its review prior to the expiration date of the current IRB approval, investigators should follow the IRB's policies and procedures for continuing IRB review of research (procedures required by 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1)), in particular by submitting materials and information required by the IRB. FDA encourages IRBs to make investigators aware of the IRB's procedures, for example, by enclosing a copy in correspondence informing the investigator of the IRB's decisions, or posting the information on a website.\n\nFootnote 9: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.60, 312.66, 812.36(c)(viii), 812.100, 812.110(b), 812.40, and 812.43(c)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recommends that the IRB's written procedures call for submission of the following information for consideration by the IRB in continuing review, if not already available to the IRB as part of the existing IRB records for the research10:\n\nFootnote 10: Some of this information may come from the sponsor, who would have access to data across all study sites. Sponsors may provide information directly to IRBs or to the clinical investigators who in turn would share it with the IRBs.\n\nA written progress report/brief project summary that includes the following or references other documents made available to the IRB:\n\nThe number of subjects accrued; (For multi-site studies, the number of subjects accrued at the local site and the number accrued study-wide, if available, should be provided.)\n\nA brief summary of any amendments to the research approved by the IRB since the IRB's initial review or the last continuing review;\n\nAny new and relevant information, published or unpublished, since the last IRB review, especially information about risks associated with the research; (Note that FDA does not expect the IRB to perform an independent review of the relevant scientific literature related to a particular research project undergoing continuing review.)\n\nA summary of any unanticipated problems.11 In many cases, such a summary could be a brief statement that there have been no unanticipated problems (i.e., adverse events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as documented in the research protocol, the informed consent document, and Investigator's Brochure (if applicable)); *\n(\\circ) A summary of any subject withdrawals from the research since the last IRB review, and the reasons for withdrawal, if known; and (\\circ) A summary of any complaints about the research from subjects enrolled at the local site since the last IRB review;\n\nThe latest version of the protocol and sample informed consent document(s) in use at the site;\n\nAny proposed modifications to the informed consent document or protocol;\n\nThe current Investigator's Brochure, if any, including any modifications;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7575280666351318", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership.

May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: IRB meeting minutes must be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings, actions taken by the IRB, the vote on these actions, the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research, and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). FDA anticipates that a study in which informed consent is not obtained for all subjects is by its very nature controversial. Therefore IRBs must summarize their discussions and decisions regarding the required elements for these studies (21 CFR 50.24(a)) in the IRB's written meeting minutes. For example, the IRB would document its discussion of issues raised during community consultation activities, particularly discussions of community opposition to, or concern about, the emergency research study. If the IRB approves the study despite the objection of some part(s) of the community, the IRB should also document this, and provide its reason(s) for doing so.\n\n4.2.4 What is meant by \"licensed physician concurrence\"?\n\nThe IRB must have the concurrence of a licensed physician, both initially and at the time of continuing review, that the criteria of 21 CFR 50.24 are met (21 CFR 50.24(a)). The licensed physician must be \"a member of or consultant to the IRB and...not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation\" (21 CFR 50.24(a)). Where the licensed physician member(s) cannot participate in the deliberation andvoting for any reason, participation in the convened meeting by a licensed physician consultant would be necessary. Because the concurrence of the licensed physician member or licensed physician consultant is required for the IRB to allow these studies to proceed, IRBs should ensure that meeting minutes record the licensed physician member's affirmative vote or the licensed physician consultant's concurrence (21 CFR 50.24(a) and 56.115(a)(2)).\n\nVI Sponsor's responsibilities\n\nWhat are the sponsor's responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nIn addition to sponsor responsibilities required for the conduct of all clinical trials set out in 21 CFR Parts 312 and 812, 21 CFR 50.24 creates additional responsibilities for emergency research conducted under this exception from informed consent requirements. Below is a list of the sponsor's responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24 and one possible order in which they might occur.37 (A sample flow chart is provided in Appendix C.)\n\nFootnote 37: Some of the activities under this rule are unique to emergency research studies; the order in which these activities occur is not specified in the regulations and may vary.\n\nAs part of the investigational plan for the study, the sponsor is responsible for defining the length of the potential therapeutic window,38 based on scientific evidence, during which the investigational product is to be administered to the subjects (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5)). Footnote 38: For more information, see Section IV. Therapeutic Window.\n\nThe sponsor is responsible for using an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iv)).39 Footnote 39: For more information on data monitoring committees, refer to FDA\u2019s Guidance on Establishment and Operations of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees; www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126578.pdf.\n\nThe sponsor submits the protocol to FDA in a separate IND or IDE, the cover sheet of which prominently identifies the study as involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24(d), 21 CFR 312.23(f), 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4), 21 CFR 812.35(a)).\n\nThe sponsor must obtain FDA's written authorization before the study may proceed (21 CFR 312.20(c); 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4)(i)).\n\nThe sponsor assists the clinical investigator in developing and providing to the IRB:\n\ninformation to document that the criteria for the exception from informed consent provided in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) through (4) are met;\n\nthe proposed investigational plan, including informed consent procedures and an informed consent document, procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for family members to object to a subject's enrollment and/or continued participation in the study (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) and (7)(v), and 50.24(b));\n\nthe clinical investigator's commitment to attempt to contact the subject's legally authorized representative (LAR) to obtain consent, or provide the subject's family\nmember an opportunity to object, prior to administering the test article during the time allotted for this within the therapeutic window (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5) and (a)(7)(v)); * procedures and information to be used in the event of a subject's death to inform a subject's LAR or family members about the subject's participation in the investigation (21 CFR 50.24(b)); * plans for community consultation and public disclosure prior to the start of the study; and * information about opt-out mechanisms, if any are proposed by the sponsor. (See also Question 68.)\n\nThe sponsor and clinical investigator (or, where appropriate, the IRB, when the IRB has decided at its discretion to carry out community consultation activities) conduct the community consultation activities. FDA recommends that one or more IRB members attend the community consultation activities in person (see also Question 44), but if an IRB member is not able to do so, information gleaned from the community consultation activities should be provided to the IRB. The IRB should determine how information from community consultation activities is to be provided to the IRB (e.g., oral report at IRB meeting, written report by the investigator).\n\nThe sponsor must monitor the progress of all investigations involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24 (21 CFR 312.54(a), 21 CFR 812.47).\n\nThe sponsor must promptly submit to the IND or IDE file (and to Docket Number 95S-0158 in the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), identified by the IND or IDE number), copies of the information that was publicly disclosed prior to initiation of the clinical investigation (e.g., plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits); see 21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(ii), 312.54(a), 812.47(a)). (See also Question 84.)\n\nThe sponsor must promptly provide in writing to FDA, information related to an IRB's determination that it cannot approve a research study under 21 CFR 50.24. The sponsor must also provide this information to investigators who are participating or asked to participate in the same or a substantially equivalent investigation, and to other IRBs that have reviewed or are asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation (21 CFR 50.24(e), 21 CFR 312.54(b), 21 CFR 812.47(b)).\n\nIf the IRB requires modifications in the plans for community consultation, the sponsor and the clinical investigator are responsible for revising the community consultation plans and resubmitting them for IRB review (21 CFR 56.109(a)).\n\nIf the IRB requires modifications in the plans for public disclosure, the sponsor and the clinical investigator are responsible for revising the public disclosure plans and resubmitting them for IRB review (21 CFR 56.109(a)).\n\nFollowing completion of the study, the sponsor prepares information to apprise researchers and the community(ies) about the study, including demographic characteristics of the research population, and the study's results (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iii)).\n\nThe sponsor must promptly submit to the IND or IDE file copies of the information that was publicly disclosed. The sponsor must also submit the information to Docket Number 95S-0158 in the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), identified by the IND or IDE number (21 CFR 312.54(a) and 21 CFR 812.47(a)). (See also Questions 84 and 94.)\n\nVII Clinical Investigator's responsibilities\n\nWhat are the clinical investigator's responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nIn addition to the clinical investigator responsibilities set forth in 21 CFR 312 and 812, 21 CFR 50.24 creates additional responsibilities for emergency research conducted with an exception from informed consent requirements. Below is a list of the clinical investigator's responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24 and one possible order in which they might occur.[33] (A sample flow chart is provided in Appendix C.)\n\nThe clinical investigator, assisted by the sponsor, provides to the IRB:\n\nmaterials documenting that the criteria for the exception from informed consent given in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) through (4) are met;\n\nthe proposed investigational plan, including informed consent procedures and an informed consent document, procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for family members to object to a subject's enrollment and/or continued participation in the study (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) and (7)(v), and 50.24(b));\n\nthe clinical investigator's commitment to attempt to contact the subject's legally authorized representative to obtain consent, or provide the subject's family member an opportunity to object, prior to administering the test article during the time allotted for this within the therapeutic window (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5) and (a)7(v));\n\nprocedures and information to be used to inform a subject's legally authorized representative or family members about the subject's participation in the investigation in the event of a subject's death (21 CFR 50.24(b)); and\n\nplans for additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects, including, at least, plans for community consultation and public disclosure prior to the start of the study.\n\nThe investigator and sponsor (or the IRB, when the IRB has decided at its discretion to carry out community consultation activities itself) conduct the community consultation activities. IRB members should attend the community consultation activities in person, but if that is not possible, information gleaned from the community consultation activities should be provided to the IRB.\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.3479163646698", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Facilitate our sharing of educational and other information with IRBs. We believe that the lack of an accurate, complete, and regularly updated listing of IRBs involved with the review of FDA-regulated studies limits our outreach and educational efforts;\n\nAssist us in scheduling and conducting IRB inspections under our bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) inspection program, by assuring up-to-date contact information; and\n\nHelp us to prioritize IRB inspections.\n\nDoes registration imply that an IRB is in full compliance with 21 CFR Part 56 or is otherwise meeting a particular standard of competence or expertise?\n\nNo. IRB registration is not a form of accreditation or certification by FDA that the IRB is in full compliance with 21 CFR Part 56. While a U.S. IRB that reviews FDA-regulated studies must register to be in compliance with 21 CFR Part 56.106(a), IRB registration does not address issues regarding an IRB's competence or expertise nor does it require IRBs to meet a particular standard in order to conduct a review.\n\nII Registration requirements\n\nWho must register?\n\nEach IRB in the U.S. that either:\n\nreviews clinical investigations regulated by FDA under sections 505(i) (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) or 520(g) (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act);or\n\nreviews clinical investigations that are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits for FDA-regulated products. [See 21 CFR 56.106(a)]\n\n5. May IRBs other than those required under 21 CFR 56.106(a), including those located outside of the U.S., register if they wish?\n\nYes, any IRB may choose to register voluntarily.\n\n6. How does an IRB submit an initial registration?\n\nIRBs that are not already in the registration system must submit an initial registration. IRBs can submit this registration electronically through http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile. If your IRB lacks the ability to register electronically, it must send its registration information, in writing, to the Good Clinical Practice Program (HF-34), Office of Science and Health Coordination, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\nAs noted above, we are utilizing a modified version of the Internet-based system OHRP has employed for registration of IRBs designated under FWAs. Both OHRP and FDA will be using this same modified system.\n\nThe electronic registration system provides instructions to assist you in providing the appropriate information, depending on whether your IRB is subject to regulation by only OHRP, only FDA, or both OHRP and FDA.\n\n7. What if my IRB is already registered in the OHRP system?\n\nIf your IRB is already registered in the OHRP system, the registration information must be updated to include all of the information required by FDA (see # 11 below). For IRBs that are currently reviewing FDA-regulated research, the additional information must be added to the database by September 14, 2009. For IRBs that are not currently reviewing FDA-regulated research, this must be done before any research involving FDA-regulated products is reviewed once the compliance date has passed. (See below for more information on the effective and compliance dates.)\n\n8. What is the effective date of the final rule and, by what date, must IRBs complete an initial registration or submit additional information as required by the FDA rule?\n\nThis rule is effective July 14, 2009. However, in order to allow IRBs to submit their initial registrations or the additional information required by the rule, FDA will not enforce the rule until September 14, 2009, the compliance date. Therefore, as stated above, IRBs that are not already in the OHRP system must submit an initial registration by September 14, 2009. For IRBs that are already in the OHRP system and are reviewing FDA-regulated research, the required additional information must be added to the database by this compliance date. After September 14, 2009, if an IRB that is not reviewing FDA-regulated research decides to do so, this additional information must be submitted before the IRB reviews research involving FDA-regulated products.\n\n9. Is assistance available if my IRB encounters technical problems when attempting to register electronically?\n\nIf your IRB encounters technical problems with the electronic registration system, it should contact an OHRP IRB Coordinator listed at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/daqi-staff.html.\n\n10. Will my IRB receive confirmation that its registration was completed?\n\nIf your IRB registers electronically, it will receive a notification that registration was accepted by HHS, sent to the electronic e-mail address that it provided as part of the registration process.\n\nIf your IRB submits written information, as described in #6 above, an electronic notification will be sent once the information is successfully entered into the system and accepted by HHS.\n\n11. What information does the final rule require from each IRB in the U.S. that reviews FDA-regulated studies?\n\nThe final rule requires the following information [see 21 CFR 56.106(b)]:\n\nThe name, mailing address, and street address (if different from the mailing address) of the institution operating the IRB and the name, mailing address, phone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the senior officer of that institution who is responsible for overseeing activities performed by the IRB;\n\nThe IRB's name, mailing address, street address (if different from mailing address), phone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address; each IRB chairperson's name, phone number, and electronic mail address; and the name, mailing address, phone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the contact person providing the registration information;\n\nThe approximate number of active protocols involving FDA-regulated products reviewed. For purposes of this rule, an \"active protocol\" is any protocol for which an IRB conducted an initial review or a continuing review at a convened meeting or under an expedited review procedure during the preceding 12 months; and\n\nA description of the types of FDA-regulated products (such as biological products, color additives, food additives, human drugs, or medical devices) involved in the protocols that the IRB reviews.\n\nIII. Revisions to Information\n\n12. Once my IRB is registered or its existing information is updated to comply with this rule, is registration permanent unless there is a change in required information?\n\nNo, an IRB is required to renew its registration and verify the required information every 3 years from the date of the last entry/change made to the registration information.\n\n13. Once registered, when is an IRB required to revise its registration information?\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe final rule specifies the following circumstances that require a revision to the registration information [see 21 CFR 56.106(e)]:\n\nIf an IRB's contact or chairperson information changes, the IRB must revise its registration information within 90 days of the change.\n\nIf an IRB decides to review new types of FDA-regulated products (e.g., to review device studies if it only reviewed drug studies previously) or to discontinue reviewing clinical investigations regulated by FDA, it must report this within 30 days of the change.\n\nIf an IRB decides to disband, this must be reported within 30 days of permanent cessation of the IRB's review of research.\n\n14. Do IRBs need to update the number of active protocols under review when changes occur?\n\nNo, we realize that the number of active protocols may change quite frequently and that continuously updating this information would be burdensome. Therefore, for changes in the number of active protocols, as well as any other additions or changes not specifically covered in 21 CFR 56.106(e) (see previous response), IRBs may wait to modify the information until it is necessary to change any of the information specified in #13 or time to renew its registration.\n\nIV. Consequences of failure to register\n\n15. What are the consequences of an IRB failing to register as required by the final rule?\n\nAn IRB that fails to register could be considered noncompliant with these regulations. As part of our inspectional activities, FDA may conduct an inspection of an IRB to verify compliance with regulatory requirements, including the requirement for an IRB to register under 21 CFR 56.106(a).\n\nSponsors and clinical investigators are required by FDA regulations governing the conduct of clinical studies (21 CFR Part 312 for drugs and biologics and 21 CFR Part 812 for devices) to use IRBs that comply with 21 CFR Part 56. Therefore, if a sponsor and/or clinical investigator submits a study for review to an unregistered IRB, that sponsor and/or clinical investigator could be considered noncompliant with FDA regulations.\n\nIn addition, we plan to use the information accrued through the IRB registration system to distribute educational materials to IRBs that review FDA-regulated studies (see #2 above). Therefore, sponsors and/or clinical investigators who use IRBs that are not registered run the risk that the IRB may not be familiar with our current policies.\n\nV. Availability of information\n\n16.

These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is \"mission-critical\" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities \"in advance of or in lieu of\" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA\u2019s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm's previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records \"in advance of or in lieu of\" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested \"in advance of or in lieu of\" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA's use of alternate tools, including a firm's responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.798919200897217", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023.

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions about regulatory and policy issues related to inspections, pending drug applications, and changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.1 This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in August 2020, and revised in January 2021.\n\nFootnote 1: In this guidance, the terms drug and pharmaceutical product include biological products.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nFDA has issued guidance on how to implement manufacturing process and facility changes; relevant guidances that describe the process for reporting changes to an application can be found in section V. References. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) remain fully capable of continuing daily activities, such as application assessments, including facility evaluation and certain inspection activities, while responding to public health needs related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible.\n\nInspections\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to inspections for facilities manufacturing pharmaceutical products and sites involved in the conduct of clinical, analytical, and nonclinical studies.\n\nQ1: How are inspections impacted by COVID-19?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system\" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only \"mission-critical\" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. For the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses.6 This helps ensure the safety of the investigator and the firm's employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish FDA's regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCurrently, certain inspections (e.g., foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical) remain temporarily postponed.\n\nWhile inspections that can be conducted by FDA during the public health emergency are limited due to factors including travel restrictions, FDA intends to continue using alternative tools, when appropriate, to evaluate facilities. This includes requesting existing inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements,7 requesting information from applicants, requesting records and other information directly from facilities and other inspected entities, and conducting remote interactive evaluations8 where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n\nA2: FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9709511995315552", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n\nOctober 2014Guidance for Industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Policy and Risk Management\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n12420 Parklawn Drive, rm. 4138\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nTel: 301-796-5300; Fax: 301-827-3670; E-mail: FDASIAImplementationORA@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122044.htm.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n\nOctober 2014\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nCircumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting or Refusing a Drug Inspection\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) in cooperation with Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

Section 707 of FDASIA adds 501(j) to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to deem adulterated a drug that \"has been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, or establishment and the owner, operator, or agent of such factory, warehouse, or establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection.\" Section 707(b) of FDASIA requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue guidance that defines the circumstances that would constitute delaying, denying, or limiting inspection, or refusing to permit entry or inspection, for purposes of section 501(j).\n\nThis guidance covers facilities that are subject to inspection under section 704 of the FD&C Act.2 This guidance defines the types of actions, inaction, and circumstances that the FDA considers to constitute delaying, denying, or limiting inspection, or refusing to permit entry or inspection for the purposes of section 501(j).3 The examples used in this guidance are not intended to serve as an exhaustive list; rather, they illustrate the most common situations that FDA has encountered in preparing for and conducting inspections as well as situations that FDA anticipates may occur. FDA does not interpret the four terms describing prohibited behavior (delay, deny, limit, refuse) necessarily to be mutually exclusive. Therefore, the behaviorsdescribed in the following scenarios may be examples of more than one type of prohibited behavior. Also note that, for purposes of this guidance, the term facility is intended to include all establishments, factories, and warehouses covered by section 501(j).\n\nSection 704 of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to conduct inspections at reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner. Although the FD&C Act does not specifically define \"reasonable,\" FDA has long maintained that the inspection authority under Section 704 of the FD&C Act \"extends to what is reasonably necessary to achieve the objective of the inspection.\"4 FDA intends to work with facilities to conduct inspections and procure the information necessary to achieve the objective of the inspection. FDA will consider reasonable explanations for behavior that may otherwise be considered to be delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing an inspection.\n\nFootnote 4: FDA, Investigations Operations Manual, Section 2.2.1.1, Authority to Enter and Inspect (2014).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nSection 704(a) of the FD&C Act provides FDA authority for inspections, specifically providing authority for duly designated officers or employees of the FDA to enter, at reasonable times, and inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, facilities subject to regulation under the FD&C Act.5 An FDA inspection is a \"careful, critical, official examination of a facility to determine its compliance with certain laws and regulations administered by the FDA.\"6 Section 706 of FDASIA amended section 704(a) of the FD&C Actby adding 704(a)(4), which allows FDA to request, in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, within a reasonable timeframe, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner, records or information that FDA may inspect under section 704(a).\n\nFacilities that are required to register under section 510 of the FD&C Act7 and that voluntarily register as outsourcing facilities under section 503B of the FD&C Act8 are required to submit certain information to FDA. FDA uses registration information for many purposes, including scheduling inspections. It is imperative that drug facilities register under section 510 when required, and that all registered facilities provide the information required by statute and our regulations to avoid creating confusion or complicating the scheduling and conduct of inspections. We also strongly encourage facilities to update point of contact e-mail information submitted to the Agency promptly if a change occurs after an annual registration submission.9\n\nFootnote 7: See also 21 C.F.R. 207. For additional information, see Guidance for Industry, Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2013 Drug Establishment Registration and Drug Listing.\n\nFootnote 8: In December 2013, FDA issued draft Guidance for Industry, Registration for Human Drug Compounding\n\nFootnote 9: Some facilities subject to inspection under section 704 of the FD&C Act, such as compounding pharmacies, may not be required to register under section 510 because they fall within an exception in section 510(g) and may not have elected to register as outsourcing facilities. Such facilities are not required to provide a point of contact e-mail address to FDA, but the Agency may refer to a point of contact designated in a state license in preparing for inspections or for other purposes, and we therefore encourage such firms to ensure that any point of contact provided in a state license is valid.\n\nIt is a prohibited act under sections 301(e) and 301(f) of the FD&C Act to refuse to permit entry or inspection or refuse to permit access to or copying of certain specified records.10 New section 501(j) of the FD&C Act, as added by FDASIA section 707, now deems a drug to be adulterated if \"...it has been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, or establishment and the owner, operator, or agent of such factory, warehouse, or establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection.\"\n\nFootnote 10: Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:... (e) The refusal to permit access to or copying of any record as required by section... 704(a).... (f) The refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704.\u201d Section 303 (21 U.S.C 333) provides penalties for violations of Section 301.\n\n3 Delay of Inspections\n\nDelays may occur for many reasons, some of which are beyond the control of the facility. However, where an owner, operator, or agent causes the delay of an inspection, this may cause the drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\n4 Delay Scheduling Pre-announced Inspections\n\nThe FD&C Act does not require FDA to pre-announce its inspections. Therefore, FDA usually does not pre-announce for-cause and routine surveillance inspections. It is, however, FDA'sgeneral practice to contact the firm before an investigator arrives at the inspection site for pre-approval and pre-license inspections, and most inspections of foreign facilities of drug products. This pre-announcement, although not required, is intended to facilitate the inspection process and ensure that appropriate records and personnel will be made available.\n\nFDA's efforts to schedule pre-announced inspections include sending correspondence to the facility's point of contact e-mail address, including the facility's U.S. agent if the facility is a foreign facility. FDA will make reasonable accommodations for local conditions, such as weather or security situations, holidays, and other non-work days, and, where appropriate, scheduled manufacturing campaigns. Examples of delay in scheduling a pre-announced inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n--------------------\nContext title: Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.076951503753662", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: No. The training of industry and academic personnel to enable them to properly perform their duties is the responsibility of their employers. However, FDA is prepared to participate in any training courses, which may be offered by industry associations or the academic community to the extent that resources will allow.\n4. If the GLPs are Phase I of Bioresearch Monitoring, what other phases are anticipated by FDA?\n\nOther phases include new regulations on obligations of sponsors and monitors of clinical investigations, obligations of clinical investigators, and obligations of institutional review boards. Note that these regulations are directed towards efficacy data and the protection of human subjects whereas the GLPs are directed towards safety data.\n5. Who makes the decision on whether or not a headquarters scientist participates in a GLP inspection? Why can't we have a headquarters scientist on each inspection?\n\nThe scheduling bureau makes the decision. During the past two years, headquarters scientists have participated in about half of all GLP inspections and, with rare exception, the Bureau of Biologics assigns a headquarters scientist to each GLP inspection. Resources do not permit more extensive participation.\n\nHow are laboratories selected for inspection?\n\nLaboratories are selected for inspection by bureaus within FDA. The criteria for selection are actual or potential involvement in studies associated with products regulated by FDA. Inspections will involve a specific study submitted to a bureau or a study selected from the firm's master list which is of interest to FDA.\n\nHow often can a laboratory expect to be inspected?\n\nRoutine surveillance inspections will occur at least once every two years or more frequently depending upon findings of previous inspections. However, more frequent inspections may occur when an audit of a specific study submitted to FDA or EPA in support of a marketing application is required.\n\nEither type of inspection can result in more frequent visits if serious adverse findings are reported. These latter visits are considered compliance or follow-up inspections and are carried out to determine if correction of previous violative conditions have been made.\n8. Will laboratories be notified in advance of an inspection? Because of the comments received during the conferences and the experiences to date with this program, laboratories will generally be notified prior to inspection. However, compliance or special investigation inspections may not follow this procedure.\n9. Can a laboratory postpone an inspection? A facility may at the time of initial FDA contact request a postponement. Such a postponement may occur when personnel responsible for the conduct of the study to be audited will be unavailable at the anticipated inspection date. FDA expects to be reasonable in arranging for an inspection date. Unreasonable delays in scheduling the inspection will however be viewed by FDA as a refusal to permit an inspection.\n10. Can a laboratory request an inspection? How? A facility may request an inspection from either the local FDA district office or from FDA headquarters. However, an inspection will be initiated only with headquarters concurrence. Consideration will be given to the work schedules under which district management is operating.\n11. If a laboratory is not performing a study on an FDA regulated product at the time the investigator arrives, will the inspection still be carried out? Routinely, GLP inspections are not scheduled unless the Agency has received a final report on a regulated product or has received submitted protocols, interim study reports, or knows that a study on a regulated product is underway. In the case of a laboratory that is not currently performing a study on a regulated product the laboratory will be asked to consent to an inspection. The FDA investigator will utilize an ongoing study, even though it is not associated with an FDA regulated product, to document the laboratory's compliance with GLPs. In such cases, the study will not be audited in terms of validating the raw data, and specifics of the study will not be included in the inspection report.\n12. Will inspections cover other areas such as chemistry, physical testing, metallurgy, etc.?To the extent that the protocol of a nonclinical laboratory study requires tests in the field of metallurgy, clinical chemistry, etc., we will examine and evaluate adherence to test specifications or protocol requirements.\n* Are firms notified of specific studies to be audited? Will sufficient time be allowed to seek authorization from the sponsor of the study to disclose the data to the FDA investigator? What happens if the sponsor of the study refuses to authorize the laboratory to disclose the records?\n\nAs stated with respect to prior notification of inspection, where FDA has an interest in auditing a study, ample time generally will be provided for the facility to seek authorization from the sponsor to disclose the data. In some cases, FDA investigators may begin inspecting the physical layout of the facilities while authorization to release the study records is being obtained. If the sponsor refuses to authorize disclosure of the records to the investigator, FDA will pursue the matter directly with the sponsor.\n* Can FDA investigators ask for records to which they are not legally entitled; can they engage in \"fishing expeditions?\"\n\nIt is not FDA policy to request documents during an inspection to which the Agency is not legally entitled. On occasion, the Agency may request such documents when pursuing an audit trail of a possible violation. Under these circumstances, it is the laboratory's prerogative to cooperate or refuse without fear of reprisal. The requests should be specific and pertinent to the inspection. The Agency discourages investigators from making vague requests to see documents with no specific purpose in mind.\n* Should the Form-FD-483, Notice of Observations issued by the FDA investigator reflect current practices only; and should it include practices that were corrected during the course of the inspection?\n\nThe FD-483 can include historical practices, which may have affected the scientific validity of the nonclinical study in question even though subsequent correction may have occurred. Any corrective action taken by the facility will be noted by the investigator in the establishment inspection report.\n* At time of the observation, the management should discuss any differing opinions and attempt to clarify the investigator's perceptions or observations. The management may also, at the conclusion of the inspection, offer to explain what the management considers to be erroneous 483 observations. Should the matter in question remain unresolved, a written objection should be sent to the local FDA district director or a meeting with district personnel should be requested to attempt to resolve the issue.\n* What is the procedure for correcting errors in the FDA investigator's inspection report? Such errors can be damaging to the laboratories since the reports are ultimately available through FOI.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.4942758083343506", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAfter issuance of a warning letter, holding a regulatory meeting, or following an enforcement action (e.g., seizure or injunction), FDA usually will conduct an inspection to confirm that corrective actions have been implemented.\n\nTo evaluate defect reports (e.g., Field Alert Reports or Biological Product Deviation Reports), FDA may request a remote interactive evaluation and/or make a request under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\n3.1.5 Specific Considerations for Bioresearch Monitoring Inspections\n\nSelection of facilities for BIMO inspections is risk based. While some facility selection factors such as inspection history and time since last inspection may be common across BIMO programs, other factors are unique to each BIMO program.\n\nFDA will consider BIMO facilities for remote interactive evaluation according to existing risk-based facility selection methodologies when there are no data integrity or other concerns that FDA determines require an inspection, and information to be evaluated can be accessed remotely. Generally, the information obtained from a remote interactive evaluation will be used to assess the facility's conduct, including data reliability and human subject protections to determine the acceptability of BIMO studies for FDA's application decision-making.\n\nAppendix B Preparing for a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nOnce the facility confirms its willingness and ability to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will schedule a brief virtual meeting to discuss logistics, responsibilities, and expectations. Discussion topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nObjectives and scope of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nIntroduction of the FDA remote interactive evaluation team and the remote interactive evaluation lead.\n\nIdentification of the facility point of contact and all other participants (e.g., sponsor or contract research organization, monitor, remote ancillary operations).\n\nSchedule of virtual interactions and the anticipated duration of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nFDA's expectations during the livestreaming walkthroughs of the facility.\n\nTime zone differences and translation services (i.e., spoken and written translation), if applicable. Virtual interactions, including remote observation of manufacturing operations or livestream assessment of data, usually will occur during the facility's normal business hours.\n\nMethods for sharing requested information, including sharing documents and the use of video-streaming technology.\n\nTechnological limitations that could impair or prevent FDA's remote interactive evaluation of the facility.\n\n3.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCheck of the internet connection throughout the facility to verify that the signal strength is adequate to support livestreaming video and audio during the actual remote interactive evaluation.\n\nIV Conducting a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nWhen facilities agree to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, FDA expects them to cooperate with the same level of transparency as they would during an FDA inspection. We expect appropriate staff to be available at scheduled times for interviews and other virtual interactions, and we expect the facility to be operational to the extent possible for FDA to evaluate areas and operations of interest (e.g., manufacturing, laboratory, packaging). If a facility is unable to support video or other virtual interactions, or if FDA determines that the video or any other virtual interaction during the remote interactive evaluation does not permit a sufficient examination of the facility or of a corrective action, FDA may terminate the remote interactive evaluation and instead perform an inspection or use other available tools.\n\nAs part of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA may:\n\nRequest and review documents, records, and other information (electronic systems).9 Footnote 9: Some remote interactive evaluations will be preceded by a request for records and other information for those facilities covered by FDA\u2019s authority under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, when appropriate. FDA requests, including requests for records, during a remote interactive evaluation are considered voluntary unless a section 704(a)(4) request is sent to the facility.\n\nUse livestream and/or pre-recorded video to examine facilities, operations, and data and other information.10 Footnote 10: For a remote interactive evaluation supporting a pending biologics license application, FDA usually will expect a facility to provide for livestream video of the manufacturing operations described in the application.\n\nThrough the facility's point of contact, schedule interviews and meetings to address any questions or concerns.\n\nEvaluate a facility's corrective actions (e.g., in response to a previous inspection or evaluation, or to the current remote interactive evaluation). An inspection instead of a remote interactive evaluation may be necessary to verify the adequacy of some corrective actions, or if evaluating the corrective actions remotely would unreasonably extend the duration of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nProvide verbal updates to the facility on observations and outstanding issues, whenever feasible.\n\nFDA will not issue a Form FDA 482, Notice of Inspection, to announce or open a remote interactive evaluation.\n\nTechnological Requirements\n\nThe quality of the remote connection (e.g., connectivity, image quality, cameras used) should be adequate for FDA to remotely review, observe, examine, and evaluate the information requested. To the extent practicable, technologies employed also should allow access for remotely viewingand evaluating operations at the facility, as necessary (e.g., aseptic practices, equipment cleaning and set up, material weighing and dispensing, instrument set up, sampling, testing). FDA understands that there may be temporary connection issues during the virtual interaction, and we expect either party to resolve the issue in a timely manner.\n\nFor security reasons, FDA will use its own IT platforms and equipment11 to host virtual interactions during remote interactive evaluations (e.g., videoconferences, livestreaming video of the facility and operations in the facility). FDA currently uses the following conferencing platforms:\n\nFootnote 11: FDA is not able to supply equipment to a facility to enable FDA\u2019s remote interactive evaluation. Additionally, FDA is not able to accept equipment or devices from a facility for our use in conducting a remote interactive evaluation.\n\nFDA Microsoft Teams\n\nFDA Zoom for Government\n\nFDA Adobe Connect\n\nRemote Interactive Evaluation of Documents and Records\n\nFDA will usually request and review documents and other information in advance of a remote interactive evaluation12 to ensure the livestream interactions are as efficient as possible. However, we may request additional documents and other information, including video recordings, at any time during the remote interactive evaluation to address questions and to explain observations. Documents and other information requested during a remote interactive evaluation are expected to be provided within a reasonable timeframe, similar to requests for documents or other information made during an inspection.\n\nFDA expects all documents requested during the remote interactive evaluation to be provided in electronic format or accessible by screen sharing during a live interaction so that the documents can be assessed efficiently. FDA will provide a secure means to send requested information during a remote interactive evaluation. For electronic documents and other information, facilities should identify any limitations and ensure that encrypted and password-protected files can be accessed by FDA. Documents submitted during a remote interactive evaluation should be in English. However, if translation is needed during a livestream interaction, the facility may need to provide a translator.\n\nFDA recognizes that some facilities maintain documents in paper format and not all electronic systems will be accessible for direct viewing. Thus, when such a facility agrees to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, they should consider taking steps to enable FDA's remote viewing and verification of the facility's documents, procedures, and electronic systems. Requested documents maintained in paper format should be scanned as searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) files when possible.\n\nConcluding a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nUpon completion of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will have a closeout meeting with the facility's management. During this meeting, FDA will usually present a written list of observations, if any, and describe and discuss any observations in sufficient detail to enable understanding and foster an appropriate response.13 This written list of observations will not be a final Agency action or decision. FDA will not issue a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. As with an inspection, FDA encourages facilities to respond during the discussion and/or provide responses in writing to the observations within 15 U.S. business days.\n\nFootnote 13: If the remote interactive evaluation, including the review of any records before or during the evaluation, is intended to supplement a scheduled inspection, then FDA usually will combine any observations from the remote interactive evaluation(s) into a single written list of observations issued at the close of the inspection, which would be issued on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations.\n\nDepending on the purpose and outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, the information and documentation collected may be used to, among other regulatory purposes:\n\nSupport FDA's assessment of pending applications, including whether to approve an application\n\nPreclude the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or defect\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.7561004161834717", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA recognizes that some facilities maintain documents in paper format and not all electronic systems will be accessible for direct viewing.

A remote interactive evaluation report and any written list of observations may be subject to a disclosure request under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIf FDA determines that an inspection will be necessary based on the outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, we will use the information obtained from the remote interactive evaluation to prepare for and conduct the inspection.\n\nVI Impacts of Remote Interactive Evaluations on Established Commitments and Timeframes\n\nIn general, the use of remote interactive evaluations should help FDA operate within normal timeframes (i.e., in a similar manner as an inspection) as outlined below, especially for higher priority activities in spite of challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFDA intends to use information from a remote interactive evaluation to meet user fee commitments and to update FDA's relevant internal databases. FDA expects that a remote interactive evaluation will generally enable us to meet a user fee goal date. However, FDA will notify applicants if we expect to miss a user fee goal date.\n\nAppendix A Commitments for Pre-Approval and Pre-License Inspections\n\nFDA will adhere to existing response timeframes applicable to inspections.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the observations identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered in the application assessment if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication. FDA may defer consideration of responses or corrective actions in the current review cycle if received after 15 days.\n\nResponses received after 15 U.S. business days will be considered in the next application user fee cycle, should the application receive a complete response action and the facility requires re-evaluation.\n\nAppendix B Timeframes for All Inspection Types\n\nFDA generally intends to use existing timelines established for reporting on and evaluating the outcome of an inspection for the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the issues identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered with respect to further regulatory action if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication of the observations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.141529560089111"], "With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed?

The guidance is applicable to the bioanalytical methods used to measure concentrations of chemical and biological drug(s) and their metabolite(s) in biological samples (e.g., blood, plasma, serum, other body fluids or tissues) obtained in nonclinical toxicokinetic (TK) studies conducted according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies conducted as surrogates for clinical studies, and all phases of clinical trials, including comparative bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies, in regulatory submissions. Full method validation is recommended for the primary matrix intended to support regulatory submissions. Additional matrices should be validated as necessary.\n\nFor studies that are not submitted for regulatory approval or not considered for regulatory decisions regarding safety, efficacy, or labeling (e.g., exploratory investigations), applicants may decide on the level of qualification that supports their own internal decision-making.\n\nThe information in this guidance applies to the quantitative analysis by ligand binding assays (LBAs) and chromatographic methods such as liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), which are typically used in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) detection.\n\nFor studies that are subject to GLP or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, the bioanalysis of study samples must conform to those requirements. The bioanalysis of biomarkers and bioanalytical methods used for the assessment of immunogenicity are not within the scope of this guidance.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII General Principles (2)\n\nMethod Development (2.1)\n\nThe purpose of bioanalytical method development is to define the design, operating conditions, limitations, and suitability of the method for its intended purpose and to ensure that the method is ready for validation.\n\nBefore or during the development of a bioanalytical method, the applicant is encouraged to, if feasible, understand the analyte of interest (e.g., the physicochemical properties of the drug, in vitro and in vivo metabolism, preferential distribution between red blood cells and plasma, and protein binding) and consider aspects of any prior analytical methods that may be applicable.\n\nMethod development involves identifying the procedures and conditions involved with quantifying the analyte. Method development can include the characterization of the following bioanalytical elements: reference standards, critical reagents, calibration curve, quality control samples (QCs), selectivity and specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, stability of the analyte, and minimum required dilution (MRD).\n\nBioanalytical method development does not require extensive record keeping or notation. Once the method has been developed, bioanalytical method validation proves that the method is suited to the analysis of the study samples.\n\nIf a problem is encountered with the method during the analysis of nonclinical or clinical study samples that requires that the analysis be stopped, any changes to the method and the rationale should be documented.\n\nMethod Validation (2.2)\n\nii.2.1 Full Validation (2.2.1)\n\nBioanalytical method validation is important to ensure the acceptability of assay performance and the reliability of analytical results. A bioanalytical method is defined as a set of procedures used for measuring analyte concentrations in biological samples. A full validation of a bioanalytical method should be performed when establishing a bioanalytical method for the quantification of an analyte in clinical and in applicable nonclinical studies. Full validation should also be performed when implementing an analytical method that is reported in the literature and when a commercial kit is repurposed for bioanalytical use in drug development. Usually, one analyte has to be determined, but on occasion it may be appropriate to measure more than one analyte. This may involve two different drugs, a parent drug with its metabolites or the enantiomers or isomers of a drug. In these cases, the principles of validation and analysis apply to all analytes of interest. For chromatographic methods, a full validation should include the following elements, unless otherwise justified: selectivity, specificity, matrix effect, calibration curve (response function), range (lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to upper limitof quantification (ULOQ)), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution integrity, stability, and reinjection reproducibility.\n\nFor LBAs, the following elements should be evaluated, unless otherwise justified: specificity, selectivity, calibration curve (response function), range (LLOQ to ULOQ), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution linearity, and stability. If necessary, parallelism can be conducted when appropriate study samples are available.\n\nThe assessments that are performed during validation should be relevant to the sample analysis workflow. The matrix used for bioanalytical method validation should be the same as the matrix of the study samples, including anticoagulants and additives. In cases in which it may be difficult to obtain an identical matrix to that of the study samples (e.g., rare matrices such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, bile or in cases where free drug is measured), surrogate matrices may be acceptable for analytical method validation.\n\nThe choice of surrogate matrix should be scientifically justified. Matrix differences within species (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender) are generally not considered different when validating a method.\n\nA specific, detailed, written description of the bioanalytical method and validation procedure should be established a priori. This description may be in the form of a protocol, study plan, report, notebook, or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n\nii.1.2 Partial Validation (2.2.2)\n\nModifications to a fully validated analytical method may be evaluated by partial validation.\n\nPartial validation can range from as little as one accuracy and precision determination to a nearly full validation (refer to section VI.A (6.1)). The items in a partial validation should be determined according to the extent and nature of the changes made to the method.\n\nii.1.3 Cross Validation (2.2.3)\n\nCross validation is required to demonstrate how the reported data are related when multiple bioanalytical methods and/or multiple bioanalytical laboratories are involved (refer to section VI.B (6.2)).\n\nIII Chromatography (3)\n\nReference Standards (3.1)\n\nDuring method validation and the analysis of study samples, a blank biological matrix is spiked with the analyte(s) of interest using solutions of reference standard(s) to prepare calibration standards and QCs. Calibration standards and QCs should be prepared from separate stock solutions. However, calibration standards and QCs may be prepared from the same stock solution provided the accurate preparation and stability of the stock solution should have been verified.\n\nA suitable internal standard (IS) should be added to all calibration standards, QCs, and study samples during sample processing. The absence of an IS should be justified.\n\nIt is important that the reference standard is well characterized and the quality (e.g., purity, identity) of the reference standard and the suitability of the IS is ensured, as the quality will affect the outcome of the analysis and, therefore, the study data. The reference standard used during validation and study sample analysis should be obtained from an authentic and traceable source. The reference standard should be identical to the analyte. If this is not possible, an established form (e.g., salt or hydrate) of known quality should be used.\n\nSuitable reference standards include compendial standards, commercially available standards or sufficiently characterized standards prepared in-house or by an external organization. A certificate of analysis (CoA) or an equivalent alternative is recommended to ensure quality and to provide information on the purity, storage conditions, retest/expiration date and batch number of the reference standard.\n\nA CoA is not required for the IS as long as the suitability for use is demonstrated, e.g., a lack of analytical interference is shown for the substance itself or any impurities thereof.\n\nWhen MS detection is used, the use of the stable isotope-labeled analyte as the IS is recommended whenever possible. However, it is important that the labeled standard is of high isotope purity and that no isotope exchange reaction occurs. The presence of unlabeled analyte should be checked and if unlabeled analyte is detected, the potential influence should be evaluated during method validation.\n\nStock and working solutions should only be prepared from reference standards that are within the stability period as documented in the CoA (either expiration date or the retest date).\n\nValidation (3.2)\n\nSelectivity (3.2.1)\n\nSelectivity is the ability of an analytical method to differentiate and measure the analyte in the presence of potential interfering substances in the blank biological matrix.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10 Bioanalytical Method Validation and Study Sample Analysis\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8224945068359375", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency's reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase \"mixtures of articles and carriers\" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing \"cold\" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological's thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered \"raw data\" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes \"studies in progress on June 20, 1979\" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.828015089035034", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed?

The MRD should be identical for all samples including calibration standards and the QCs and it should be determined during method development. If MRD is changed after establishment of the method, partial validation is necessary. MRD should be defined in the Validation Report of the analytical method.\n\nCommercial and Diagnostic Kits\n\nCommercial or diagnostic kits (referred to as kits) are sometimes co-developed with new chemical or biological drugs for point-of-care patient diagnosis. The recommendations in this section of the guideline do not apply to the development of kits that are intended for point-of-care patient diagnosis (e.g., companion or complimentary diagnostic kits). Refer to the appropriate guideline documents regarding regulatory expectations for the development of these kits.\n\nIf an applicant repurposes a kit (instead of developing a new method) or utilises \"research use only\" kits to measure chemical or biological drug concentrations during the development of a novel drug, the applicant should assess the kit validation to ensure that it conforms to the drug development standards described in this guideline.\n\nValidation considerations for kit assays include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIf the reference standard in the kit differs from that of the study samples, testing should evaluate differences in assay performance of the kit reagents. The specificity, accuracy, precision and stability of the kit assay should be demonstrated under actual conditions ofuse in the facility conducting the sample analysis. Modifications from kit processing instructions should be completely validated.\n\nKits that use sparse calibration standards (e.g., one- or two-point calibration curves) should include in-house validation experiments to establish the calibration curve with a sufficient number of standards across the calibration range.\n\nActual QC concentrations should be known. Concentrations of QCs expressed as ranges are not sufficient for quantitative applications. In such cases QCs with known concentrations should be prepared and used, independent of the kit-supplied QCs.\n\nCalibration standards and QCs should be prepared in the same matrix as the study samples. Kits with calibration standards and QCs prepared in a matrix different from the study samples should be justified and appropriate experiments should be performed.\n\nIf multiple kit assay lots are used within a study, lot-to-lot variability and comparability should be addressed for any critical reagents included in the kits.\n\nIf a kit using multiple assay plates is employed, sufficient replicate QCs should be used on each plate to monitor the accuracy of the assay. Acceptance criteria should be established for the individual plates and for the overall analytical run.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.9783294200897217", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: In some cases, it would be appropriate to use an asymmetric interval with a larger upper bound to rule out superiority than lower bound to rule out inferiority. An asymmetric interval could be reasonable, for example, if the dose used in the clinical study is near the plateau of the dose-response curve and there is little likelihood of dose-related effects (e.g., toxicity). In most cases, use of an asymmetric interval would generally allow for a smaller sample size than would be needed with symmetric margins. However, if there is a demonstration of clear superiority, then further consideration should be given as to whether the proposed product can be considered biosimilar to the reference product.\n\nIn some cases, depending on the study population and endpoint(s), ruling out only inferiority may be adequate to establish that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product. For example, if it is well established that doses of a reference product pharmacodynamically saturate the target at the clinical dose level and it would be unethical to use lower than clinically approved doses, a non-inferiority (NI) design may be sufficient.32\n\nFootnote 32: If an NI design is considered appropriate, sponsors are encouraged to refer to the draft guidance for industry Noninferiority Clinical Trials. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nA sponsor should provide adequate scientific justification for the choice of study design, study population, study endpoint(s), estimated effect size for the reference product, and margin(s) (how much difference to rule out). Sponsors should discuss their study proposal(s) and overall clinical development plan with FDA before initiating the comparative clinical study(ies).\n\n4.2.4 Extrapolation of Clinical Data Across Indications\n\nIf the proposed product meets the statutory requirements for licensure as a biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act based on, among other things, data derived from a clinical study or studies sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in an appropriate condition of use, the applicant may seek licensure of the proposed product for one or more additional conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. However, the applicant would need to provide sufficient scientific justification for extrapolating clinical data to support a determination of biosimilarity for each condition of use for which licensure is sought.\n\nSuch scientific justification for extrapolation should address, for example, the following issues for the tested and extrapolated conditions of use:\n\nThe MOA(s) in each condition of use for which licensure is sought; this may include:\n\nThe target/receptor(s) for each relevant activity/function of the product\n\nThe binding, dose/concentration response, and pattern of molecular signaling upon engagement of target/receptor(s)\n\nThe relationships between product structure and target/receptor interactions\n\nThe location and expression of the target/receptor(s)\n\nThe PK and bio-distribution of the product in different patient populations (Relevant PD measures may also provide important information on the MOA.)\n\nThe immunogenicity of the product in different patient populations\n\nDifferences in expected toxicities in each condition of use and patient population (including whether expected toxicities are related to the pharmacological activity of the product or to off-target activities)\n\nAny other factor that may affect the safety or efficacy of the product in each condition of use and patient population for which licensure is sought\n\nDifferences between conditions of use with respect to the factors described above do not necessarily preclude extrapolation. A scientific justification should address these differences in the context of the totality of the evidence supporting a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nIn choosing which condition of use to study that would permit subsequent extrapolation of clinical data to other conditions of use, FDA recommends that a sponsor consider choosing a condition of use that would be adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the two products.\n\nThe sponsor of a proposed product may obtain licensure only for a condition of use that has been previously licensed for the reference product. If a reference product has a condition of use that was licensed under section 506(c) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 601, subpart E (accelerated approval), and the reference product's clinical benefit in this condition of use has not yet been verified in postmarketing studies, the proposed product sponsor should consider studying another condition of use for which the reference product is licensed to avoid potential complications in the event that postmarketing studies fail to verify the clinical benefit of the reference product for the condition of use.\n\nVIII Postmarketing safety monitoring considerations\n\nRobust postmarketing safety monitoring is an important component in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of biological products, including biosimilar therapeutic protein products.\n\nPostmarketing safety monitoring should first take into consideration any particular safety or effectiveness concerns associated with the use of the reference product and its class, the proposed product in its development and clinical use (if marketed outside the United States), the specific condition of use and patient population, and patient exposure in the biosimilar development program. Postmarketing safety monitoring for a proposed product should also have adequate mechanisms in place to differentiate between the adverse events associated with the proposed product and those associated with the reference product, including the identification of adverse events associated with the proposed product that have not been previously associated with the reference product. Rare, but potentially serious, safety risks (e.g., immunogenicity) may not be detected during preapproval clinical testing because the size of the population exposed likely will not be large enough to assess rare events. In particular cases, such risks may need to be evaluated through postmarketing surveillance or studies. In addition, as with any other biological product, FDA may take any appropriate action to ensure the safety and effectiveness of a proposed product, including, for example, requiring a postmarketing study or clinical trial to evaluate certain safety risks.33\n\nFootnote 33: See, for example, sections 505(o)(3) and 505(p)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBecause some aspects of postmarketing safety monitoring are product-specific, FDA encourages sponsors to consult with appropriate FDA divisions to discuss the sponsor's proposed approach to postmarketing safety monitoring.\n\nIX Consultation with FDA\n\nMany product-specific factors can influence the components of a product development program intended to establish that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product. Therefore, FDA will ordinarily provide feedback on a case-by-case basis on the components of a development program for a proposed product. In addition, it may not be possible to identify in advance all the necessary components of a development program; and the assessment of one element (e.g., structural analyses) at one step can influence decisions about the type and amount of subsequent data for the next step. For these reasons, FDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to establish the totality of the evidence that supports a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nFDA also advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about the approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.\n\n6 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n6.1 Glossary\n\nAs used in this guidance, the following terms are defined below:\n\nBiological product means \"a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.\"34 Footnote 34: Section 7002(b)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, amending section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act.\n\nBiosimilar or biosimilarity means that \"the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components,\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\"35 Footnote 35: Section 7002(b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nChemically synthesized polypeptide means any alpha amino acid polymer that (a) is made entirely by chemical synthesis and (b) is less than 100 amino acids in size.\n\nProduct, when used without modifiers in this guidance, is intended to refer to the intermediates, drug substance, and/or drug product, as appropriate.

The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix B Dose Selection:\n\nFor blood level BE studies, it is recommended to dose animals according to the labeled dose as opposed to the assay content of the test and reference batches.\n\nThe blood level BE study should generally be conducted at the highest labeled (e.g., mg/kg) dose approved for the reference product. By using the highest approved dose, significant formulation differences are more easily detected in most cases. However, if it can be substantiated that the reference product exhibits linear PK across the entire dose range, then any approved dose can be used if a scientific justification is provided as to why the highest dose cannot be used. In exceptional cases where a batch of reference product with an assay content differing less than 5% from the test product cannot be found, the data could be dose normalized. In such cases, the procedure for dose normalization should be pre-specified and justified by inclusion of the results from the assay of the test and reference products in the protocol.\n\nA BE study conducted at a higher than approved dose can be appropriate when a multiple of the highest approved dose is needed to achieve measurable blood levels. In general, the maximum dose would be limited to 3x the highest dose approved for the reference product. The reference product should have an adequate margin of safety at the higher than approved dose level and should exhibit linear PK (i.e., there are no saturable absorption or elimination processes). In this case, a scientific justification should accompany the choice of the dose.\n\nFor reference products with less than proportional increase in AUC with an increase in dose (nonlinear kinetics) across the therapeutic range, the following should be considered:\n\nWhen there is evidence indicating that the product absorption may be limited by saturable absorption processes, this can lead to two formulations appearing to be bioequivalent when administered at the highest labeled dose but fail to be bioequivalent when administered at lower approved doses. To avoid this situation, use of a dose that is less than the highest approved dose is preferable. In this case, a scientific justification should accompany the choice of the dose (showing that the dose is within the linear range).\n\nIf there is nonlinearity over the therapeutic range due to low solubility, then BE should be established at both the highest labeled dose and at the lowest labeled dose (or a dose in the linear range), i.e. in this situation, two BE studies may be recommended.\n\nIn crossover studies, the same total dose should be administered to each animal in all study periods. The use of dose adjustments in those rare situations where large weight changes are anticipated (e.g., studies conducted in rapidly growing animals where there is a risk of differences in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination in period 1 vs 2 that could bias the within-subject comparison) should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere relevant, doses should be rounded up based on the available strength of the solid oral dosage form, or to the nearest upper division on the dosing equipment.\n\nSolid oral dosage forms should not be manipulated in a way that could bias the study, e.g., by grinding or filing to achieve equal doses. Breaking tablets along score lines can be appropriate if the uniformity of the scored sections can be supported by pharmaceutical/manufacturing data (e.g., content uniformity of the halves). For reference products, in the absence of manufacturing or pharmaceutical data, the information included in the product labeling can be used as a guide for allowable tablet manipulation.\n\nThe study report should include the labeled dose administered to each animal in each period of the study.\n\nC. Route of Administration Selection:\n\nUnless otherwise justified when conducting an in vivo BE study:\n\nThe same route and site of administration should be used for the test and reference products.\n\nSeparate BE studies should be submitted for each route of administration approved for the reference product.\n\nD. Study Design Considerations:\n\n1. Crossover versus parallel study design:\n\nA two-period, two-sequence, crossover study is commonly used in blood level BE trials because it eliminates a major source of study variability: between subject differences in the rates of drug absorption, drug clearance, and the volume of drug distribution. The study design is as follows:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \\hline Period & Sequence A & Sequence B \\ \\hline\n1 & Test & Reference \\ \\hline\n2 & Reference & Test \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nNote that to eliminate potential confounding by period effects, there should be two sequences included in the design of a two period crossover study.\n\nDue to the potential risk of invalidating the crossover design, the treatment administered in Period 1 should not affect the PK associated with the treatment administered during Period 2. For this reason, the duration of the washout interval should ensure that the drug and its metabolites are essentially cleared from the body, and there are no residual physiological effects that will alter how the drug administered in Period 2 is processed by the study subjects. Therefore, in addition to proof of absence of pre-dose concentrations, to minimize the risk of carryover effects, it is recommended that the duration of the washout interval should be at least 5 times the blood terminal elimination half-life of the API and its metabolite(s) (when there is indication that the metabolites may affect pharmacokinetics of the parent compound in the second period).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen dealing with endogenous substances, the presence of carry-over effects is very difficult to quantify. Therefore, caution should be exercised to ensure that the washout period is of an adequate duration. The length of the washout period should be addressed and justified a priori in the protocol. For endogenous substances the pre-dose (baseline) drug concentrations for Period 1 should be comparable to the pre-dose concentrations for Period 2.\n\nA parallel study design may be preferable in the following situations:\n\nThe parent compound and/or its metabolites induce physiological changes in the animal (e.g., liver microsomal enzyme induction, altered blood flow) that can alter the bioavailability of the product administered in Period 2.\n\nThe parent compound and/or metabolites, or the drug product (e.g., flip flop kinetics) has a terminal elimination half-life so long that a risk is created of residual drug present in the blood at the time of Period 2 dosing (i.e., a wash-out period is not practical).\n\nThe duration of the washout for the two-period crossover study is so long as to result in significant physiological changes in the study subjects.\n\nThe total blood volume of the species precludes the capture of blood concentration-time profiles for more than one period.\n\nAlternative study designs can be considered. For example:\n\nReplicate study designs (See subsection II. D. 2)\n\nSequential study designs (See subsection II. D. 3)\n\nTo obtain approvals in multiple regions, a 3-treatment crossover or a multiple reference parallel study design can be considered when performing one study with two different reference products, depending on the products registered in the respective regions.\n\nAlternative designs and corresponding proposed method of statistical analysis can be discussed with the regulatory authority prior to conducting the BE study. Pilot data or literature can be used in support of alternative study designs.\n\nRegardless of how the study will be conducted, the design should be described a priori in the protocol.\n\n2 Replicate Study Design:\n\nA replicate study design is an investigation where at least one of the treatments is repeated.\n\nIf it is estimated that a traditional crossover design would not be feasible without the inclusion of a very high number of animals, replicate study designs can be considered using three (partial replication where for example, the reference is replicated in all subjects) or four (full replication, where each subject receives the test and reference products twice) periods within each group. In some jurisdictions, a replicate study design can also be used for applying a reference scaled in vivo bioequivalence approach. Individuals wishing to consider the use of alternative statistical approaches should contact individual regulatory authorities for additional information on potential statistical considerations and conditions under which such alternative approaches are considered acceptable.\n\n3 Sequential study design:\n\nIt is appropriate to use a sequential approach when attempting to demonstrate product BE. When employing a sequential study design, an initial group of subjects can be treated and their data analyzed. If bioequivalence has not been demonstrated, an additional group can be recruited and the results from both groups combined in a final analysis.\n\nIf this approach is adopted, appropriate steps should be taken to preserve the overall Type I error of the experiment and the stopping criteria should be clearly defined prior to initiating the study. The analysis of the first stage data should be treated as an interim analysis and both analyses should be conducted at adjusted significance levels (with the confidence intervals corrected accordingly using an adjusted coverage probability that will exceed 90%). The plan to use a two-stage approach should be pre-specified in the protocol along with the number of animals to be included in each stage and the adjusted significance levels to be used for each of the analyses.\n\n4 Single dose versus multiple dose study design:\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #224 (VICH GL52) Bioequivalence- Blood Level Bioequivalence Study \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.801513671875"], "Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: The \"Supplement Facts\" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines.

All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b.

You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format.

Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (\"the final rule\"). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" and \"I\" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of \"infants\" (or \"infants 7 to 12 months\") and \"children less than 4 years\" have been changed to \"infants through 12 months\" and \"children 1 through 3 years of age\" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines \"food\" as: \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of \"drug\") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of \"food,\" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.354843258857727", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and \"other carbohydrate\" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the \"Nutrition Facts\" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \"Nutrition Facts\" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for \"Calories,\" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for \"Calories\" and the numeric value of \"Calories.\" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" declaration now immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" is the declaration of \"Serving size.\" \"Serving size\" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the \"Serving size\" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the \"Serving size\" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry\" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics\" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile \"Calories from fat\" can no longer be declared, \"Calories from saturated fat\" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare \"Added Sugars\" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for \"Total Sugars\" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The 'X' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that \"added sugars\" are a subcomponent of \"total sugars.\" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement \"Contains less than 1 gram\" or, alternatively, \"less than 1 gram\" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.1745941638946533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter III.

If the principal display panel of your product is 5square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent does not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of 21 CFR 101.105(f)\n3. How must I express the net quantity of contents statement on my label? You must express the net quantity of contents statement in either weight, measure, numerical count or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. When you express this quantity as a weight or measure, you must specify both metric (grams, kilograms, milliliters, or liters) and U.S. Customary System (ounces, pounds, or fluid ounces) terms. Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992 and 21 CFR 101.105\n4. Why must I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You must calculate the area of the principal display panel (calculated in square inches or square centimeters) to determine the minimum type size that is permitted for the net quantity of contents statement.\n5. How do I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You may calculate the area of the principal display panel for rectangular or square shaped packages by multiplying the height by the width (both in inches or both in centimeters), and for cylindrical shaped packages by multiplying 40% of the circumference by the height. For example, a rectangular package that is 8 inches high and 6 inches wide would have a principal display panel of 48 square inches. A cylindrical package having a circumference of 10 inches and a height of 2 inches would have a principal display panel of 8 square inches.\n6. Am I required to place the net quantity of contents statement conspicuously and prominently on my product labels? Yes. You are required to use a print style that is prominent, conspicuous, and easy to read, with letters not more than three times as high as wide. Use letters that contrast sufficiently with the background.\n7. What is the minimum type size that I can use for the net quantity of contents statements? The smallest type size permitted for the net quantity of contents statement is based on the size of the principal display panel. You may determine the height of the type by measuring the height of upper case letters, when only upper case letters are used, or the height of a lower case letter \"o,\" or its equivalent, when mixed upper and lower case letters are used. The table below sets out the minimum type size in inches (in.), with metric equivalents (millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm)) in parentheses.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nMinimum Type Size & Area of Principal Display Panel \\ \\hline\n1/16 in. (1.6 mm) & 5 sq. in. (32 sq. cm.) or less \\ \\hline\n1/8 in. (3.2 mm) & More than 5 sq. in. (32 sq. cm.) but not more than 25 sq. in. (161 sq. cm.) \\ \\hline\n3/16 in. (4.8 mm) & More than 25 sq. in. (161 sq. cm.) but not more than 100 sq. in. (645 sq. cm.) \\ \\hline\n1/4 in. (6.4 mm) & More than 100 sq. in. (645 sq. cm.) but not more than 400 sq. in. (2580 sq. cm.) \\ \\hline\n1/2 in. (12.7 mm) & Over 400 sq. in. (2580 sq. cm.) \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n21 CFR 101.105(h) and (i)\n\n21.1 What must I include in a weight-based net quantity of contents statement?\n\nYou must include only the quantity of the dietary supplement in a container, and not the weight of the container, wrappers and packing materials, except that in the case of dietary supplements packed in containers designed to deliver the dietary supplement under pressure, the propellant is included in the net quantity declaration.\n\n21.2 Cfr 101.105(g)\n\n21.2 What must I include in a numerical count-based net quantity statement?\n\nYou must include the number of units in a container, e.g. \"too tablets.\"\n\n21.2 Cfr 101.105(a)\n\n21.2 May I use qualifying phrases in the net quantity of contents statement?\n\nNo. You may not use qualifying phrases that qualify a unit or weight, measure, or count (such as \"jump quart\" and \"full gallon\") in the net quantity of contents statement because they tend to exaggerate the amount of the dietary supplement in the container.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter III. Net Quantity of Contents \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.28472900390625", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Figure 8: Tabular Display\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]\n\n11.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe third modification is the use of abbreviations, as listed in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B). We now allow for the following additional abbreviations on labels for small and intermediate-sized packages: \"vitamin\" may be abbreviated as \"Vit.,\" \"potassium\" may be abbreviated as \"Potas.,\" and \"Includes\" may be abbreviated as \"Incl.\" These abbreviations will further conserve label space. In addition, we allow the abbreviations of \"Total carb.\" and \"Incl.\" to be used on dual-column display labels (see section VIII.D).\n\n3.3 What Type Size Must be Used for the Declaration of Calories on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nThe numeric value for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 14 point, and the word \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.4 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages Differ from the Standard Label Version?\n\nThe \" -- servings per container\" declaration immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading, as in the standard label version; however, it must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). If a linear display is used, then the actual number of servings (i.e., \"Servings\" as shown in Fig 10) may be listed instead of the servings per container declaration.\n\nThe declaration of \"Serving size,\" which follows below the \" -- servings per container\" or \"servings\" declaration, is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages. See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n11.3.5 Is the \"% Daily Value*\" Footnote Required on Foods in Small and Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nFor products in small and intermediate-sized packages that qualify for the use of the tabular or linear format as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), there is no longer a requirement to place an asterisk, followed by the statement \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,\" at the bottom of the label if the footnote corresponding to \"% Daily Value\" is omitted. If \"Daily Value\" is not spelled out in the heading, then an asterisk can be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement \"% DV = % Daily Value\" in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.6 VIII.D How Do I Comply with the Nutrition Labeling Formatting Requirements when Dual Column Labeling is Required or Provided Voluntarily?\n\nDual column labeling is required under certain conditions, and can be used in other situations. In the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 9003), we announced the availability of a separate Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That CanReasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry,\" which, among other topics, discusses a new requirement regarding the use of dual-column labeling (Ref. [9]). In the Federal Register of December 31, 2019 (84 FR 72230), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Sizes-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics.\" This final guidance also discusses formatting issues for dual-column labeling (Ref. [10]).\n\nRegarding specific formatting for dual column labeling, the final rule updates certain requirements. Directly following the serving size declarations, each column of nutrition information must contain a heading that accurately describes why a dual column is being utilized. For example, a product may provide nutrition information for two different RDI groups, like in Figure 11 below. A product may also provide nutrition information for two different forms of the same food (e.g., \"Per 1/4 cup mix\" and \"Per prepared portion\"), as in Figure 12 below (21 CFR 101.9(e)). The quantitative information by weight and percent DV must be presented for each column, and the columns are to be separated by vertical lines (21 CFR 101.9(e)(3)). Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals must be separated from the information on other nutrients by a bar and be arrayed vertically in the required order (21 CFR 101.9(e)(4)). Note that the \"Amount per serving\" statement is not required for the dual column formats (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)). See Figures 11 through 15 (see also 21 CFR 101.9(e)(5) and (e)(6)(i)).\n\nFigure 11: Dual Column Display for 2 different RDI Groups (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 12: Dual Columns, Two Forms of the Same Food (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 13: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Container (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15 shows the use of dual columns in a tabular display format for products. As mentioned above, \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, and the numeric amount for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). \"Serving size\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point; however, the \" - servings per container\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, as with the standard label version (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i) and (ii)). \"Amount per serving\" is not required (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)).\n\nVIIILE When Can the Simplified Format Be Used?\n\nYou can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). For foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, you can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total\n\nFigure 14: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Unit (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15: Tabular Dual Column Display (101.9(e)(6)(ii))\n\ncarbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). The definition of \"insignificant amount\" has not changed.\n\nThe footnote requirement which states, \"Not a significant source of (\\underline{\\ })\" (listing the name(s) of any nutrients listed in this paragraph that are present in insignificant amounts) still exists (21 CFR 101.9(f)(4)). While the full \"% Daily Value\" footnote (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)) is not required for the simplified format, the column header \"% Daily Value\" can be abbreviated as \"% DV.\" If this abbreviation is used, then an asterisk must be placed at the end of the abbreviation and the corresponding footnote must read, \"% DV = % Daily Value\" (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). No footnote is required if \"Daily Value\" is spelled out in the column header (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). Figure 16 displays an example of a simplified format label.\n\nVIIILF Are Foods in Small Packages with a Total Surface Area Available to Bear Labeling of Less than 12 Square Inches Exempt from the Nutrition Facts Labeling Requirements?\n\nNot always. Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are not exempt from bearing a Nutrition Facts label if a nutrition claim or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)) is used or as outlined for covered vending machine food (see 21 CFR 101.8(c)). However, as previously allowed, if your product qualifies for and uses the exemption (i.e., claims or other nutrition information are not presented on the label or in labeling or advertising), then you must list an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)(A)).\n\nVIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of \"Serving size,\" \"Calories,\" and the numerical value for \"Calories,\" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and \"Nutrition Facts\" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., \"Amount Per Serving\" and \"% Daily Value\") and footnotes (e.g., \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.346860408782959", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Since I sell many of my standard menu items for home delivery, do I need to provide calorie information for those standard menu items listed on a \"delivery\" menu?\n\nAnswer:Yes.\n\nMust I provide the written nutrition information for standard menu items listed on the \"take out\" menu?\n\nAnswer:Yes, written nutrition information is required to be available to the customer upon request for standard menu items on the take-out menu and must be on the premises of the covered establishment. The covered establishment should determine the most feasible way to provide this information to the customer for food that is delivered, as long as the applicable requirements are satisfied. For example, the covered establishment could deliver the written nutrition information with the standard menu item ordered by a consumer if the consumer requests the information. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)) Please note that the \"take-out\" menu must also include the succinct statement required by 21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(i)(B) and the statement of availability of the written nutrition information required by 21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(i)(C).\n\nWhat nutrition information must be available in written form on the premises of the covered establishment when a customer requests nutrition information for standard menu items?\n\nAnswer:For each menu item, the following nutrients must be listed in the order specified below, using the measurements specified:\n\nTotal calories (cal)\n\nCalories from fat (fat cal)\n\nTotal fat (g)\n\nSaturated fat (g)\n\n(Trans) fat (g)Cholesterol (mg)\n\nSodium (mg)\n\nTotal carbohydrate (g)\n\nDietary fiber (g)\n\nSugars (g)\n\nProtein (g)\n\n(21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(A))\n\n5.60 Must I round the nutrients required in the written nutrition information?\n\nAnswer:Rounding of the nutrients is required in the written nutrition information and must be in compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). Please see Appendix A for rounding rules. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii))\n\n5.61 How should I present the written nutrition information?\n\nAnswer:You must present the written nutrition information in a clear and conspicuous manner. The written nutrition information must use a color, type size, and contrasting background that render the information likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii))\n\n62 How should the written nutrition information be provided for a standard menu item that contains insignificant amounts of some of the required nutrients?\n\nAnswer:If a standard menu item contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the required nutrients, the written nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format, as specified in 21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(B). (See questions 5.64-5.66.) (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(B)) Note that this format is different from the simplified format specified in 21 CFR 101.9(f).\n\n63 How should the written nutrition information be provided for a standard menu item that contains insignificant amounts of all of the required nutrients?\n\nAnswer:If a standard menu item contains insignificant amounts of all nutrients required to be listed in the written nutrition information (see question 5.64), a covered establishment is not required to provide written nutrition information for such standard menu item. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(B)) However, if the covered establishment makes a nutrient content claim or health claim, the establishment is required to provide nutrition information on the nutrient that is the subject of the claim in accordance with 21 CFR 101.10. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(B))\n\nAnswer: An insignificant amount of a nutrient is an amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and protein, an insignificant amount is an amount that can be declared as \"less than one gram.\" (See Appendix A) (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(B)((I)))\n\nHow must the simplified format be presented, and what nutrient information must be provided?\n\nAnswer: The simplified format must be presented in a column, list, or table. It must include information for total calories, total fat, total carbohydrates, protein, and sodium. In addition, if calories from fat and any other nutrients identified in 21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(A) (i.e., saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, sugars) are present in more than insignificant amounts, they must also be included in the simplified format of the written nutrition information. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(B)((2)))\n\nIs any other information required as part of the simplified format?\n\nAnswer: Yes. If you use the simplified format, you must include at the bottom of the list of nutrients the statement \"Not a significant source of.\" The blank must be filled in with the names of the nutrients (including calories from fat) that are required to be listed in the written nutrition information (see question 5.59) that are present in insignificant amounts. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(B)((3)))\n\nHow do I provide the written nutrition information for my variable menu items?\n\nAnswer: In general, for each size of the variable menu item offered for sale, you must provide the written nutrition information (see question 5.59 for required nutrients) for the basic preparation of the item and separately for each topping, flavor, or variable component. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(C)((I)))\n\nWhen there are multiple toppings available for selection on my pizza, I decrease the amount of each topping based on the total number of toppings ordered by the consumer. How should I provide the written nutrition information for this item?\n\nAnswer: For each size of such pizza, you must declare the amount of each nutrient for each topping as a single value representing the amount of each nutrient for each topping when added to a single topping pizza. In this case, you must state that the nutrient declarations are for the topping when added to a one topping pizza, such as \"pepperoni, total calories: 200 calories, calories from fat: 90 calories, total fat: 10 g, etc., when added to a one-topping pizza.\" (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(C)((2)))\n\nI am a covered establishment and I have a kiosk that consumers can use to order made-to-order subs. How do I declare calorie information for such foods?\n\nAnswer: Where a covered establishment has a kiosk that consumers can use to order made-to-order subs, we would consider the kiosk to constitute a menu. If there is no basic preparation ofthe menu item that the customer starts with, and the customer instead selects each item that would make up the made-to-order sub (such as,, bread, meat), then the calorie information should be provided for each item that makes up the sub as that item is displayed for selection on the kiosk. For example, \"6-inch wheat bread - 210 Cal.\" Further, if the software of the kiosk permits, the total calorie content of the sub may also be provided to the customer once the order is complete. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(iii)(A))\n\nIf there is a basic preparation of the menu item, for example, a turkey sandwich with provolone cheese on white bread (350 calories), for which the customer would select toppings at the kiosk to add to the basic preparation of the menu item, then the covered establishment should declare calories for each topping in accordance with 21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(i)(A)(5). For example, if you add mayonnaise to a sandwich at the kiosk, the kiosk would include a calorie declaration for the mayonnaise option such as \"adds 90 calories.\"\n\nHow and where should I provide the succinct statement on such kiosk in my covered establishment?\n\nAnswer: Where such kiosk constitutes a menu, the succinct statement must be posted prominently and in a clear and conspicuous manner in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of any calorie declaration appearing on the same menu and in the same color or in a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the calorie declarations and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the calorie declarations. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(i)(B)(1)). For menus, the succinct statement must appear on the bottom of each page of the menu. Similarly, in the case of a kiosk that constitutes a menu, the succinct statement should appear on each screen of the kiosk.\n\nHow and where should I provide the statement of availability on such kiosk in my covered establishment?\n\nAnswer: Where such kiosk constitutes a menu, the statement of availability must be posted prominently and in a clear and conspicuous manner in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of any calorie declaration appearing on the same menu and in the same color or in a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the calorie declarations, and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the calorie declarations. (21 CFR 101.11(b)(2)(i)(C)(1)) For menus, the statement of availability need only appear on the bottom of the first page of the menu with standard menu items. Similarly, in the case of a kiosk that constitutes a menu, the statement of availability need only appear on the first screen with standard menu items.\n\nFor some of my variable menu items that are standard menu items, the nutrient values are the same for different flavors, varieties, or variable components of a combination meal. How should I declare the required nutrient values for the written nutrition information when they are the same for different flavors, varieties, or variable components?\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- A Labeling Guide for Restaurants and Retail Establishments Selling Away-From-Home Foods - Part II \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.392220497131348"], "From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain contracts specify that a series of nonclinical laboratory studies be done on a single test article. Do the GLPs permit the designation of different study directors for each study under the contract?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs require that a sponsor approve the study director for a contracted study?\n\nNo. Testing facility management designates the study director.\n\nA firm functions as a primary contractor for nonclinical laboratory studies. The actual studies are then subcontracted to nonclinical laboratories. Is the firm considered to be a \"sponsor?\"\n\nThe GLPs define \"sponsor\" as a person who initiates and supports a nonclinical laboratory study. Sponsorship in the cited example would be determined by the specific provisions of the contract.\n\nWho is responsible for test article characterization - the sponsor or the contractor?\n\nThe GLPs do not assign the responsibility in this area. The matter is a subject of the specific contractual arrangement between the sponsor and the contractor.\n\nDo contract laboratories have to show the sponsor's name on the Master Schedule Sheet or can this information be coded?\n\nThe information can be coded but the code must be revealed to the FDA investigator on request.\n\nA sponsor desires to contract for a nonclinical laboratory study to be conducted in a foreign laboratory. Must the sponsor notify the foreign laboratory that compliance with the U.S. GLPs is required?\n\nYes.\n\nMust a contractor include in the final report information on test article characterization and stability when such information has been collected by the sponsor?\n\nNo. The contractor should identify in its final report which information will be subsequently supplied by the sponsor.\n\nMust a sponsor reveal toxicology data already collected on a test article to a contract laboratory?\n\nNo. If use of the test article involves a potential danger to laboratory personnel, the contract laboratory should be advised so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n\nSection 58.15 Inspection of a testing facility.\n\nWhat is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n\nThe FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection. The items listed on the form serve as the basis for the exit discussion with laboratory management at which time management can either agree or disagree with the items and can offer possible corrective actions to be taken.\n\nManagement may also respond to the district office in writing after it has had sufficient time to properly study the FD-483.\n\nWill a laboratory subsequently be notified of GLP deviations not listed on the FD-483?\n\nThis does happen. The FDA investigator prepares an establishment\n\ninspection report (EIR) which summarizes the observations made at the\n\nlaboratory and which contains exhibits concerning the studies audited\n\n(Protocols, SOPs, CV's, etc.). The EIR is then reviewed by District\n\npersonnel as well as headquarters personnel. This review may reveal\n\nadditional GLP deviations that should be and are communicated to\n\nlaboratory management.\n\nWhat kinds of domestic toxicology laboratory inspections does FDA\n\nperform and how frequently are they done?\n\nFDA performs four kinds of inspections related to the GLPs and\n\nnonclinical laboratory studies. These include: A GLP inspection -\n\nan inspection undertaken as a periodic, routine determination of a\n\nlaboratory's compliance with the GLPs, it includes examination of an\n\nongoing study as well as a completed study; A data audit - an\n\ninspection made to verify that the information contained in a final\n\nreport submitted to FDA is accurate and reflected by the raw data; A\n\ndirected inspection - any of a series of inspections conducted for\n\nvarious compelling reasons (questionable data in a final report, tips\n\nfrom informers, etc.); A followup inspection - an inspection made\n\nsometime after a GLP inspection which revealed objectionable\n\npractices and conditions. The purpose of the followup inspection is\n\nto assure that proper corrective actions have been taken. GLP\n\ninspections are scheduled once every two years whereas the other\n\nkinds of inspections are scheduled as needed.\n\nShould GLP investigators comment on the scientific merits of a protocol or the scientific interpretation given in the final report? No. Their function is strictly a noting of observations and verification. Scientific judgments are made by the respective headquarters review units that deal with the test article.\n\nCan a GLP EIR be reviewed by laboratory, management prior to issuance? No. The GLP EIR is an internal agency document which reflects the observations and findings of the FDA investigator. It can not be released to anyone outside the agency until agency action has been completed and the released copy is purged of all trade secret information. Laboratories that disagree with portions of the EIR should write a letter which contains the areas of disagreement to the local FDA District Office. The laboratories can ask that their letters accompany the EIR whenever it is requested under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nCan FDA investigators take photographs of objectionable practices and conditions? It is the agency position that photographs can be taken as a part of the inspection and this position has been sustained by a District Court decision.\n\nThe GLP Compliance Program requires the FDA investigator to select an ongoing study in order to inspect current laboratory operations. What criteria are used to select the study? The studies are selected in accord with agency priorities, i.e. the longest term study on the most significant product.\n\nDoes FDA inspect international nonclinical laboratories once every two years? No. Overseas laboratories are scheduled for inspection on the basis of having submitted to FDA the results of significant studies on important products.\n\nWhat background materials are used by agency investigators to prepare for a GLP inspection? Prior to an inspection, the following materials are usually reviewed:(a) The GLP regulations; (b) The Management Briefings Post-Conference Report; (c) Assorted memoranda and policy issuances; (d) The GLP Compliance Program; (e) The protocol of an ongoing study, if available; (f) The final report of a completed study, if available; (g) The inspection report of the most recent inspection.\n\nHow long does FDA allow a laboratory to effect corrective actions after an inspection has been made? If the results of an inspection reveal that significant deviations from the GLPs exist, the laboratory will be sent a regulatory letter that lists the major deviations and that requests a response within 10 days. The response should describe those actions that the laboratory has taken or plans to take to effect correction. The response should also encompass items that were listed on the FD-483 and those that were discussed during the exit discussion with laboratory management. A specific time table should be given for accomplishing the planned actions. The reasonableness of the time table will be determined by FDA compliance staff, based on the needs of the particular situation. For less significant deviations, the laboratory will be sent a Notice of Adverse Findings letter that also lists the deviations but that requests a response within 30 days. Again, the reasonableness of the response will be determined by FDA staff.\n\nDoes a laboratory's responsibility for corrective action listed on a FD-483 begin at the conclusion of an inspection or upon receipt of correspondence from the originating bureau in which corrective action is requested? The FD-483 lists observations of violative conditions that have the capability to adversely affect nonclinical laboratory studies. Corrective actions should be instituted as soon as possible.\n\nDoes FDA preannounce all GLP inspections? Laboratory management is informed of all routine GLP inspections prior to the inspection, but special compliance or investigative inspections need not be preannounced.\n\nSUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that \"personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform\" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an \"acting\" or \"deputy\" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated \"deputy\" or \"acting\" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9539278745651245", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: General Principles (1.4)\n\nThe development of a pharmaceutical is a stepwise process involving an evaluation of both animal and human efficacy and safety information. The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterization of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exposure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility. This information is used to estimate an initial safe starting dose and dose range for the human trials and to identify parameters for clinical monitoring for potential adverse effects. The nonclinical safety studies, although usually limited at the beginning of clinical development, should be adequate to characterize potential adverse effects that might occur under the conditions of the clinical trial to be supported.\n\nHuman clinical trials are conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaceutical, starting with a relatively low systemic exposure in a small number of subjects. This is followed by clinical trials in which exposure to the pharmaceutical usually increases by duration and/or size of the exposed patient population. Clinical trials should be extended based on the demonstration of adequate safety in the previous clinical trial(s), as well as on additional nonclinical safety information that becomes available as clinical development proceeds.\n\nSerious adverse clinical or nonclinical findings can influence the continuation of clinical trials. Within the overall clinical context, these findings should be evaluated to determine the appropriateness and design of additional nonclinical and/or clinical studies.\n\nClinical trials are conducted in phases for which different terminology has been utilized in the various regions. This M3(R2) document generally uses the terminology as defined in the ICH E8 guidance (Ref. 2). However, as there is a growing trend to merge phases of clinical development, in some cases this document also relates the nonclinical studies to the duration and size of clinical trials and the characteristics of the subjects included.\n\nHigh Dose Selection for General Toxicity Studies (1.5)\n\nGenerally, in toxicity studies, effects that are potentially clinically relevant can be adequately characterized using doses up to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It is not essential to demonstrate the MTD in every study. Other equally appropriate limiting doses include those that achieve large exposure multiples or saturation of exposure or use the maximum feasible dose (MFD). These limit doses (see additional details below and Figure 1) prevent the use of doses in animals that would not add value to predicting clinical safety. These recommendations are consistent with those for reproduction and carcinogenicity study designs that already have defined limit doses and/or exposures (Refs. 3 and 4).\n\nLimit doses for acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity studies of 1000 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day for rodents and nonrodents are considered appropriate in all casesexcept those discussed below. In the few situations where a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day does not result in a mean exposure margin of 10-fold to the clinical exposure and the clinical dose exceeds 1 gram (g) per day, then the doses in the toxicity studies should be limited by a 10-fold exposure margin or a dose of 2000 mg/kg/day or the MFD, whichever is lower. In those rare situations in which the dose of 2000 mg/kg/day results in an exposure that is less than the clinical exposure, a higher dose up to the MFD can be considered.\n\nDoses providing a 50-fold margin of exposure (usually based on group mean area under the curve (AUC) values (see Note 1) of the parent drug or the pharmacologically active molecule of a pro-drug) to the clinical systemic exposure generally are also considered acceptable as the maximum dose for acute and repeated-dose toxicity studies in any species.\n\nTo support phase 3 clinical trials for the United States, dose-limiting toxicity generally should be identified in at least one species when using the 50-fold margin of exposure as the limit dose. If this is not the case, a study of 1 month or longer duration in one species that is conducted at the 1000 mg/kg limit dose, MFD or MTD, whichever is lowest, is recommended. However, on a case-by-case basis this study might not be warranted if a study of a shorter duration identifies dose-limiting toxicity at doses higher than those resulting in a 50-fold exposure margin.\n\nIf genotoxicity endpoints are to be incorporated into a general toxicity study, then an appropriate maximum dose should be selected based on a MFD, MTD, or limit dose of 1000 mg/kg/day.\n\nFigure 1: Recommended High Dose Selection for General Toxicity Studies\n\nII Pharmacology studies (2)\n\nSafety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies are defined in ICH S7A (Ref. 5). The core battery of safety pharmacology studies includes the assessment of effects on cardiovascular, central nervous, and respiratory systems, and should generally be conducted before human exposure, in accordance with ICH S7A and S7B (Refs. 5 and 6). When warranted, supplemental and follow-up safety pharmacology studies can be conducted during later clinical development. Consideration should be given to inclusion of any in vivo evaluations as additions to general toxicity studies, to the extent feasible, in order to reduce animal use.\n\nIn addition, primary PD studies (in vivo and/or in vitro) are intended to investigate the mode of action and/or effects of a substance in relation to its desired therapeutic target. Such studies are generally conducted during the discovery phase of pharmaceutical development and as such, are not generally conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). These studies can contribute to dose selection for both nonclinical and clinical studies.\n\nIII Toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic studies (3)\n\nIn vitro metabolic and plasma protein binding data for animals and humans and systemic exposure data (ICH S3A, Ref. 7) in the species used for repeated-dose toxicity studies generally should be evaluated before initiating human clinical trials. Further information on pharmacokinetics (PK) (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) in test species and in vitro biochemical information relevant to potential drug interactions should be available before exposing large numbers of human subjects or treating for long duration (generally before phase 3). These data can be used to compare human and animal metabolites and for determining if any additional testing is warranted.\n\nNonclinical characterization of a human metabolite(s) is only warranted when that metabolite(s) is observed at exposures greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater levels in humans than the maximum exposure seen in the toxicity studies. Such studies should be conducted to support phase 3 clinical trials. For drugs for which the daily administered dose is (<)10 mg, greater fractions of the drug related material might be more appropriate triggers for testing. Some metabolites are not of toxicological concern (e.g., most glutathione conjugates) and do not warrant testing. The nonclinical characterization of metabolites with an identified cause for concern (e.g., a unique human metabolite) should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIV Acute Toxicity Studies (4)\n\nHistorically, acute toxicity information has been obtained from single-dose toxicity studies in two mammalian species using both the clinical and a parenteral route of administration. However, such information can be obtained from appropriately conducted dose-escalation studies or short-duration dose-ranging studies that define an MTD in the general toxicity test species (Refs. 8 and 9).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen this acute toxicity information is available from any study, separate single-dose studies are not recommended. Studies providing acute toxicity information can be limited to the clinical route only and such data can be obtained from non-GLP studies if clinical administration is supported by appropriate GLP repeated-dose toxicity studies. Lethality should not be an intended endpoint in studies assessing acute toxicity.\n\nIn some specific situations (e.g., microdose trials; see section VII (7) acute toxicity or single-dose studies can be the primary support for studies in humans. In these situations, the high dose selection can be different from that described in section I.E (1.5), but should be appropriate for supporting the intended clinical dose and route. These studies should be performed in compliance with GLP.\n\nInformation on the acute toxicity of pharmaceutical agents could be useful to predict the consequences of human overdose situations and should be available to support phase 3. An earlier assessment of acute toxicity could be important for therapeutic indications for which patient populations are at higher risk for overdosing (e.g., depression, pain, and dementia) in out-patient clinical trials.\n\nV Repeated-dose Toxicity Studies (5)\n\nThe recommended duration of the repeated-dose toxicity studies is usually related to the duration, therapeutic indication, and scope of the proposed clinical trial. In principle, the duration of the animal toxicity studies conducted in two mammalian species (one nonrodent) should be equal to or exceed the duration of the human clinical trials up to the maximum recommended duration of the repeated-dose toxicity studies (Table 1). Limit doses/exposures that are considered appropriate in repeated-dose toxicity studies are described in section I.E (1.5).\n\nIn circumstances where significant therapeutic gain has been shown, trials can be extended beyond the duration of supportive repeated-dose toxicity studies on a case-by-case basis.\n\nClinical Development Trials (5.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.4897265434265137", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n\nThe GLPs permit these materials to be stored in the archives of either the testing laboratory or the sponsor. If they are stored in the sponsor's archives, the archives of the testing laboratory must identify the storage location.\n\nIf a sponsor agrees to characterize and store test articles submitted for study to a contractor, must the contractor also verify the characterization and provide storage for the test articles? No, but the contractor must identify the storage location.\n\nWhat is the \"completion date\" of a nonclinical laboratory study? The completion date is the date that the study director signs the final report. Some discretion must be used however, since the protocol calls for a proposed \"completion date.\" In this case, it would be adequate for the protocol to list a completion date for the in vivo phase and qualify it as such.\n\nWith respect to archival material, what is required to be listed as the date of the study? The study date would be the same as the completion date of the study.\n\nDo all studies on a test article need to be submitted in support of an application for a research or marketing permit? All studies need be submitted, however, not all studies need be conducted in accord with the GLPs. The conforming amendments provide that a statement be included in the submission which identifies which studies have not been conducted in compliance with the GLPs and the extent of the non-compliance.\n\nWhat should be included in the signed and dated reports of the individual scientists participating in the study? The final report prepared by the study director should have appended to it all reports written by other participating scientists. These reports should contain sufficient detail to enable the study director to write a final report, which reflects the results of the study.\n\nSubpart K Disqualification of Testing Facilities\n\n58.200 Purposes\n\n58.202 Grounds for Disqualification\n\n58.204 Notice of And Opportunity for Hearing on Proposed Disqualification\n\n58.210 actions UPON DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.213 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION REGARDING\n\nDISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.215 alternative OR ADDtional actions TO DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.217 suspension OR TERMINATION OF A TESTING FACILITY BY A SPONSOR\n\n58.219 reinstatement OF A DISQUALIFI TESTING FACILITY\n\nENFORCEMENT STRategy\n\nWhat can FDA do to force a laboratory to take corrective actions to achieve compliance with the GLPs? Are warnings given to the laboratory?\n\nFDA has a number of regulatory sanctions, which can be brought to bear on a violative firm in order to, bring about compliance with the law. These include rejection of studies, withdrawal of approval of marketed products if such products are supported by defective studies, prosecution and, after June 20, 1979, disqualification of the laboratory. FDA's present GLP enforcement policy is to provide adequate warning and to afford a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.\n\nDisqualifying a laboratory on the basis of failing to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs raises the question of whether all violations are considered-equally, are weighted, or are evaluated scientifically to consider the impact on the outcome of the study.\n\nA laboratory will not be considered for disqualification unless all of the following criteria are met:\n\nThe violations of the various provisions of the GLPs are evaluated to assess their impact on the validity of the studies. It is impossible to assign weights to the various provisions of the GLPs. Noncompliance with the various provisions must be evaluated in the context of the entire laboratory operation and the kinds of studies being performed. Thus, a violation of a specific provision may be critical for one laboratory doing long-term studies and not for another laboratory engaged in short term studies.\n\na. failure to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs;\n\nb. the noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the studies;\n\nc. other lesser regulatory actions (warnings, rejection of individual studies) have not or will not be adequate to achieve compliance with the GLPs.\n\nIf a laboratory is disqualified, how long does the disqualification last? Under what conditions does reinstatement occur?The disqualification will last until the laboratory submits in writing to the Commissioner, reasons for reinstatement including a detailed description of the corrective actions it has taken to assure that the violations which led to disqualification will not recur. Reinstatement will depend upon one or more inspections which show that the laboratory is in compliance with GLPs.\n\nParagraph 231 of the preamble to the GLPs states: \"The order of disqualification creates a rebuttable presumption that all studies previously conducted by the facility are unacceptable. Paragraph 226 states: \"Studies conducted at facilities that are in substantial compliance will be presumed to be valid.\" Can we presume that studies conducted during a period when a lab is found to be substantially in compliance will be accepted by FDA as valid even if the laboratory is disqualified at a later date?\n\nYes, unless FDA develops information to the contrary.\n4. If a contract laboratory is disqualified because of a study performed for one sponsor, what effect does this have on other studies performed for other sponsors? What about studies underway at the time of disqualification?\n\nFDA will not disqualify a laboratory on the basis of one invalid study. Disqualification is viewed as a most serious regulatory sanction by FDA and will only be imposed when the facts demonstrate that the laboratory is incapable of producing valid scientific data and will not take adequate corrective measures. In the event a laboratory is disqualified, all studies performed by the laboratory, including those in progress are presumed to be unacceptable unless the sponsors of those studies can establish, to the satisfaction of FDA, that the studies were not affected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification.\n5. What steps must be taken by FDA prior to removal of a product from the market because of a rejected study which was pivotal to the assessment of safety?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.578230857849121", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.2.1 ERT Products Used in Nonclinical Studies\n\nThe investigational ERT product that will be administered in clinical trials should be used in the nonclinical studies that are used to determine a safe dose in humans. Sponsors should characterize each lot of an investigational ERT product used in the nonclinical studies according to prospectively established criteria, consistent with the stage of product development. Sponsors should also highlight and discuss in the investigational new drug application (IND) similarities and differences between the drug substance and the drug product intended for use in nonclinical studies and for clinical trials, including differences in excipients.\n\nii.2.2 Selecting Animal Species\n\nSponsors should conduct nonclinical evaluations in relevant species. Assessing factors for determining a relevant species necessitates considering the specific ERT product and clinical indication. Some additional factors sponsors should consider when determining the most relevant species for testing ERT products include (1) comparability of molecular attributes, including the interspecies homology of the enzyme and the cell-surface receptors mediating uptake of the circulating ERT product; (2) distribution of the native enzyme and/or ERT product compared with that of humans; and (3) feasibility of using the planned clinical delivery systemor procedure, as appropriate. Sponsors should also justify the appropriateness of each animal species.3\n\nFootnote 3: We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) for animal use in testing when feasible. FDA encourages sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering a nonanimal testing method believed to be suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. FDA will consider if the alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nii.1.3 Animal Models of Disease\n\nAlthough studies in animal models of human diseases caused by single enzyme defects are not expected to replace clinical studies in humans, they can provide, in selected situations, complementary and supportive information that can facilitate the progression of a human ERT development program. The extent to which the information obtained from such animal models may be relevant to the human disease of interest depends on many factors. To this end, it is desirable that the selected animal disease model displays a phenotype that mimics to a large extent the clinical manifestations and the overall course of the human disease. Greater credibility and relevance can be given to animal data if the metabolic pathways and essential intermediary components are conserved between the selected animal species and humans. It is essential not only that the inactivated animal gene is the same as the human gene but also that the animal and human genes serve the same biological functions and that the metabolic pathways are preserved across species. If reliance on animal data is proposed, the IND should include information supporting the usefulness and/or ability of the models to mimic the target disease population.\n\nAnimal models of disease may provide proof of concept that the ERT of interest has the desired biological effect. They may also help identify a biologically effective dose or doses and dosing regimen or regimens and confirm the effectiveness of the animal dose through studies that measure reduction in tissue substrate levels or other related histopathological changes that can be linked mechanistically to the enzymatic defect. They can further provide evidence of biological activity by demonstrating improvement of the disease manifestations (including effects on survival).\n\nIn addition, studies in animal models can support future reliance on noninvasive biomarkers (e.g., disease-specific substrate levels and/or enzyme-reaction products in the circulation) as long as the rate and extent of improvement of the biomarker levels correlate with a reduction in tissue substrate deposition/tissue damage and/or improvements in organ function. Such biomarkers may later be used as pharmacodynamic markers of disease activity in humans in clinical trials and may even be qualified as surrogate markers.\n\nIf studies in animal models of disease are used to support the safety of an ERT product, sponsors should incorporate safety endpoints in the POC studies. FDA encourages sponsors to discuss the adequacy of study designs (e.g., number of animals used and plans for tissue collection and evaluation) with the review division before initiating the study.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSensors should perform an appropriate nonclinical safety assessment to support the proposed clinical development program. Healthy animals represent the standard test system employed to conduct traditional toxicological studies. For studies to support ERT clinical trials, sponsors can consider study designs that use animal models of disease that incorporate important safety parameters that allow for assessing the potential toxicity of an investigational ERT product. Sponsors should consider POC studies in relevant animal disease models modified to assess toxicology endpoints prospectively, including microscopic examinations of tissues, as support for initiating human clinical trials. Using animal disease models for toxicity testing may also allow sponsors to detect toxicity caused by the interaction of the drug and the disease in ways that would not be observed in healthy animals. To obtain agreement on study design, sponsors should discuss such study designs with the review division before initiating a study.\n\nThe nonclinical safety assessment, whether conducted in healthy animals or in animal disease models, should be sufficiently comprehensive to permit identifying, characterizing, and quantifying potential local and systemic toxicities, their onset (i.e., acute or delayed), the effect of the product dose level on toxicity findings, and the possibility for reversing any toxicities (if applicable).\n\nThe overall design of the nonclinical studies should support the safety of the proposed clinical trial. Nonclinical toxicology study designs should include the following, as applicable:\n\nAn adequate number of animals per sex that are appropriately randomized to each group. The number of animals needed will depend on existing safety concerns for the investigational ERT product, the species, the model, and the delivery system. If safety data are generated from POC studies to support clinical trials, sponsors should use an adequate number of animals to appropriately assess the safety endpoints. FDA recommends sponsors consult with the review division for design of these studies before initiating a study.\n\nAnimals with the appropriate age and developmental status as related to the proposed clinical trial population. When a first-in-human clinical trial for an ERT product will enroll pediatric patients, sponsors should conduct toxicity studies that use juvenile animals before initiating a clinical trial. The major issue is the potential for adverse effects on the developing organ systems in young pediatric patients (e.g., central nervous system, reproductive tract, immune system, and skeletal system). ICH M3(R2) and the guidance for industry Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Pediatric Drug Products (February 2006) provide recommendations for determining the need for juvenile animal studies. Sponsors can submit the protocol for the juvenile animal toxicology studies to the review division for the division's concurrence on appropriate toxicology endpoints before conducting the study. The juvenile animal toxicity studies potentially may be waived when (1) clinical development is initiated in adult patients, (2) there are no specific safety concerns from studies in adult animals or adult patients, and (3) target organs with identified toxicity concerns are not undergoing development at the time of treatment.__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nAppropriate control groups. A control group should be included in all toxicology studies with ERT products. An appropriate control group should be age-matched animals that have been administered the formulation vehicle only. When it is necessary to co-administer an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) to control hypersensitivity reactions to the ERT product, sponsors should include in the study a vehicle control group and a vehicle-plus-antihistamine control group. Sponsors should also provide justification for the specific control group or groups selected.\n\nAppropriate dose levels. Results obtained from POC studies should guide selection of the target dose levels both for nonclinical safety assessment and for clinical development. ICH M3(R2) and its subsequent questions-and-answers document provide considerations for selecting high doses for general toxicity studies. In general, in the absence of frank toxicity, the exposure at the highest doses tested for ERT products should be severalfold greater than the exposure expected at the highest proposed clinical dose regimen. The highest dose level used in nonclinical studies may be restricted because of animal size, tissue volume or size, ROA, or product-manufacturing capacity. Sponsors should provide justification, with supporting data, for the specific dose levels selected.\n\nThe dosing schedule should reflect the expected clinical exposure, to the extent possible.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational Enzyme Replacement Therapy Products- Nonclinical Assessment Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.0619659423828125", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: (13) With respect to each nonclinical laboratory study contained in the application, either a statement that the study was conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.\n\n(d)Amendment or extension of an exemption.

Studies of longer duration have not generally provided useful information that changed the clinical course of development.\n\nFor chronic use of biopharmaceutical products developed for patients with advanced cancer, the principles for duration of toxicology studies are outlined in ICH S9.\n\nRecovery (3.3)\n\nRecovery from pharmacological and toxicological effects with potential adverse clinical impact should be understood when they occur at clinically relevant exposures. This information can be obtained by an understanding that the particular effect observed is generally reversible/nonreversible or by including a nondosing period in at least one study, with at least one dose level, to be justified by the sponsor. The purpose of the nondosing period is to examine reversibility of these effects, not to assess delayed toxicity. The demonstration of complete recovery is not considered essential. The addition of a recovery period just to assess potential for immunogenicity is not required.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExploratory Clinical Trials (3.4)\n\nThe flexible approaches to support exploratory clinical trials as outlined in the guidance M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (ICH M3(R2)) can be applicable to biopharmaceuticals. It is recommended that these approaches be discussed and agreed upon with the appropriate regulatory authority.\n\nIV Immunogenicity (4)\n\nImmunogenicity assessments are conducted to assist in the interpretation of the study results and design of subsequent studies. Such analyses in nonclinical animal studies are not relevant in terms of predicting potential immunogenicity of human or humanized proteins in humans.\n\nMeasurement of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in nonclinical studies should be evaluated when there is:\n\n(1) evidence of altered PD activity;\n\n(2) unexpected changes in exposure in the absence of a PD marker; or\n\n(3) evidence of immune-mediated reactions (immune complex disease, vasculitis, anaphylaxis, etc.).\n\nSince it is difficult to predict whether such analysis will be called for prior to completion of the in-life phase of the study, it is often useful to obtain appropriate samples during the course of the study, which can subsequently be analyzed when warranted to aid in interpretation of the study results. When ADAs are detected, their impact on the interpretation of the study results should be assessed (see also section III.F (3.6), paragraph 2 in ICH S6 for further guidance on the impact of immunogenicity).\n\nCharacterization of neutralizing potential is warranted when ADAs are detected and there is no PD marker to demonstrate sustained activity in the in vivo toxicology studies. Neutralizing antibody activity can be assessed indirectly with ex-vivo bioactivity assay or an appropriate combination of assay formats for PK-PD, or directly in a specific neutralizing antibody assay.\n\nV Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity (5)\n\nGeneral Comments (5.1)\n\nReproductive toxicity studies should be conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the guidance S5(R2) Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products and Toxicity to Male Fertility (ICH S5); however, the specific study design and dosing schedule can be modified based on an understanding of species specificity, the nature of the product and mechanism of action, immunogenicity and/or pharmacokinetic behavior, and embryo-fetal exposure.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn assessment of reproductive toxicity with the clinical candidate in a relevant species is generally preferred. The evaluation of toxicity to reproduction should be conducted only in pharmacologically relevant species. When the clinical candidate is pharmacologically active in rodents and rabbits, both species should be used for embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies, unless embryo-fetal lethality or teratogenicity has been identified in one species.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies should only be conducted in nonhuman primates (NHPs) when they are the only relevant species.\n\nWhen the clinical candidate is pharmacologically active only in NHPs, there is still a preference to test the clinical candidate. However, an alternative model can be used in place of NHPs if appropriate scientific justification is provided.\n\nWhen no relevant animal species exists for testing the clinical candidate, the use of transgenic mice expressing the human target or homologous protein in a species expressing an ortholog of the human target can be considered, assuming that sufficient background knowledge exists for the model (e.g., historical background data) (see Note 1 of ICH S6). For products that are directed at a foreign target such as bacteria and viruses, in general, no reproductive toxicity studies would be expected (See section II.A (2.1)).\n\nWhen the weight of evidence (e.g., mechanism of action, phenotypic data from genetically modified animals, class effects) suggests that there will be an adverse effect on fertility or pregnancy outcome, these data can provide adequate information to communicate risk to reproduction, and under appropriate circumstances, additional nonclinical studies might not be warranted.\n\nFertility (5.2)\n\nFor products where mice and rats are pharmacologically relevant species, an assessment of fertility can be made in one of these rodent species (see ICH S5). ICH S5 study designs can be adapted for other species provided they are pharmacologically relevant; in addition, the design of the study should be amended as appropriate, for example to address the nature of the product and potential for immunogenicity.\n\nIt is recognized that mating studies are not practical for NHPs. However, when the NHP is the only relevant species, the potential for effects on male and female fertility can be assessed by evaluation of the reproductive tract (organ weights and histopathological evaluation) in repeat dose toxicity studies of at least 3 months' duration using sexually mature NHPs. If there is a specific cause for concern based on pharmacological activity or previous findings, specialized assessments such as menstrual cyclicity, sperm count, sperm morphology/motility, and male or female reproductive hormone levels can be evaluated in a repeat dose toxicity study.\n\nIf there is a specific concern from the pharmacological activity about potential effects on conception/implantation and the NHP is the only relevant species, the concern should be addressed experimentally. A homologous product or transgenic model could be the only practical means to assess potential effects on conception or implantation when those are of specific concern. However, it is not recommended to produce a homologous product or transgenic model solely to conduct mating studies in rodents. In absence of nonclinical information, the risk to patients should be mitigated through clinical trial management procedures, informed consent, and appropriate product labeling.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal (EFD) and Pre/Postnatal Development (PPND) (5.3)\n\nPotential differences in placental transfer of biopharmaceuticals should be considered in the design and interpretation of developmental toxicity studies (see Note 3).\n\nFor products pharmacologically active only in NHPs, several study designs can be considered based on intended clinical use and expected pharmacology. Separate EFD and/or PPND studies, or other study designs (justified by the sponsor) can be appropriate, particularly when there is some concern that the mechanism of action might lead to an adverse effect on embryo-fetal development or pregnancy loss. However, one well-designed study in NHPs that includes dosing from day 20 of gestation to birth (enhanced PPND; ePPND) can be considered, rather than separate EFD and/or PPND studies.\n\nFor the single ePPND study design described above, no Caesarian section group is warranted, but assessment of pregnancy outcome at natural delivery should be performed. This study should also evaluate offspring viability, external malformations, skeletal effects (e.g., by X-ray) and, ultimately, visceral morphology at necropsy. Ultrasound is useful to track maintenance of pregnancy but is not appropriate for detecting malformations. These latter data are derived from postpartum observations. Because of confounding effects on maternal care of offspring, dosing of the mother postpartum is generally not recommended. Other endpoints in the offspring can also be evaluated if relevant for the pharmacological activity. The duration of the postnatal phase will be dependent on which additional endpoints are considered relevant based on mechanism of action (see Note 4).\n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies in NHPs can only provide hazard identification. The number of animals per group should be sufficient to allow meaningful interpretation of the data (see Note 5).\n\nThe sponsor should justify the study design if other NHP species are used. The developmental toxicity studies in NHP as outlined above are just hazard identification studies; therefore, it might be possible to conduct these studies using a control group and one dose group, provided there is a scientific justification for the dose level selected. An example of an appropriate scientific justification would be a monoclonal antibody that binds a soluble target with a clinical dosing regimen intended to saturate target binding. If such a saturation of target binding can be demonstrated in the animal species selected and there is an up to 10-fold exposure multiple over therapeutic drug levels, a single dose level and control group would provide adequate evidence of hazard to embryo-fetal development.\n\nTiming of Studies (5.4)\n--------------------\nContext title: S6(R1) Addendum- Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.348983287811279"], "Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including \"outliers\". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n\nUnless a study falls within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c), specific record requirements are listed in 21 CFR 812.140. In general, the records that are needed are those that provide the data for testing the study hypotheses. Records should contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the collected data.\n\nWe also recommend that investigators:\n\na. Maintain records of all data elements captured in the study, including raw measurements and subject co-variables in the form of demographic and morbidity factors; b. Link every observation recorded to the subject and that person's co-variable data; c. Preserve information obtained for all subjects enrolled and for all specimens collected.\n\nAdditionally, electronic spreadsheets of study data are useful. Given the possible need to review or analyze study data at the most detailed level, electronic spreadsheets may help to minimize review time. For information on electronic records, see the guidance document, \"Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures -- Scope and Application,\" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation\n\nn/Guidances/ucm072322.pdf. There is also a more general guidance document available on electronic records for clinical studies that is entitled \"Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials,\" which can be found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126402.htm.\n\nWhat does FDA recommend be included in the final report of the investigation from the sponsor to all reviewing IRBs (and to FDA for significant risk studies) (21 CFR 812.150(b)(7))?\n\nA final report should be a basic scientific report of the studies conducted, including the results of testing the study hypotheses. This report can be a useful means of providing a simple account of the data collection and study outcome. Such a report can facilitate preparation of the eventual submission for regulatory action, particularly when accompanied by the information included in the investigational plan (see the Glossary for definition).\n\nThe suggested format for the IDE final report, which FDA includes as an enclosure in all IDE approval letters, is found in Appendix 5 of this guidance.\n\nIt should be noted that FDA will consider submission of a marketing application (510(k), PMA, or HDE) to serve as the final report for the IDE. When a study sponsor submits a marketing application in lieu of the final report, the sponsor should still submit a supplement to the IDE stating that the marketing application should be considered the final report for the study.\n\nThe final report for significant risk device investigations must be submitted to the IRBs and/or FDA within six months after termination or completion of the study. 21 CFR 812.150(b)(7).\n\nVII. Glossary\n\nNote: this glossary is written in plain language and is for use exclusively with this guidance document.\n\nDefinitions that have been taken from the Act, other pertinent laws, or in Federal regulations include the relevant citation.\n\n510(k) - See Premarket Notification.\n\nAgreement meeting - a meeting, under section 520(g)(7) of the Act (21 U.S.C. SS 360j(g)(7)), that is available to anyone planning to investigate the safety or effectiveness of a class III device (see definition below) or any implant. The purpose of the meeting is to reach agreement on the key parameters of the investigational plan, including the study protocol. The meeting is to be held within 30 days of the receipt of a written request. FDA will document in writing any agreement reached and make it a part of the administrative record. The agreement is binding on FDA and can only be changed with the written agreement of the applicant or when there is a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the device. See 21 U.S.C. SS 360j(g)(7). A guidance document regarding these meetings, \"Early Collaboration Meetings Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and for CDRH Staff,\" is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument\n\ns/ucm073604.htm.\n\nAnalyte specific reagent (ASR) - ASRs are defined as \"antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, specific receptor proteins, ligands, nucleic acid sequences, and similar reagents which, through specific binding or chemical reactions with substances in a specimen, are intended for use in a diagnostic application for identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance or ligand in biological specimens.\" 21 CFR 864.4020(a). ASRs are medical devices that are regulated by FDA. They are subject to general controls, including current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), 21 CFR Part 820, as well as the specific provisions of the ASR regulations (21 CFR 809.10(e), 809.30, 864.4020).\n\nClass I devices - devices for which the general controls of the Act are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. They typically present minimal potential for harm to the user and the person being tested. They are subject to general controls, which include registration and listing, labeling, and adverse event reporting requirements (section 513(a)(1)(A) of the Act). Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to certain limitations found in section 510(l) of the Act and in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. Some are also exempt from the \"Quality Systems Regulation\" found in 21 CFR Part 820. IVD examples of Class I devices include complement reagent, phosphorus (inorganic) test systems (21 CFR 862.1580), and E. coli serological reagents (21 CFR 866.3255).\n\nClass II devices - devices for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness and for which establishment of special controls can provide such assurances. Special controls may include special labeling, mandatory performance standards, risk mitigation measures identified in guidance, and postmarket surveillance (section 513(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Some Class II devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to limitation in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. IVD examples of Class II devices include glucose test systems (21 CFR 862.1345), antinuclear antibody immunological test systems (21 CFR 866.5100), and coagulation instruments (21 CFR 864.5400).\n\nClass III devices - devices for which insufficient information exists to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness through general or special controls. Class III devices are usually those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury (section 513(a)(1)(C) of the Act). Most Class III devices require premarket approval (PMA, see definition below). IVD examples of these include automated PAP smear readers, nucleic acid amplification devices for tuberculosis, and total prostate specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of cancer. A limited number of Class III devices that are equivalent to devices legally marketed before enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 may be marketed through the premarket notification (510(k)) process (see definition below), until FDA has published a requirement for manufacturers of that generic type of device to submit PMA data.\n\nCompassionate use - The compassionate use provision allows access for patients with a serious disease or condition who do not meet the requirements for inclusion in the clinical investigation but for whom the treating physician believes the device may provide a benefit in treating and/or diagnosing their disease or condition. There must be no feasible alternative therapies/diagnostics available. Compassionate use is typically available only for individual patients but also may be used to treat a small group. Prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs.\n\nFurther information can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.791296005249023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: A similar approach should be adopted to exploring the influence of outliers, the statistical definition of which is, to some extent, arbitrary. Clear identification of a particular value as an outlier is most convincing when justified medically as well as statistically, and the medical context will then often define the appropriate action. Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favor any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully updated during blind review. If no procedure for dealing with outliers was foreseen in the trial protocol, one analysis with the actual values and at least one other analysis eliminating or reducing the outlier effect should be performed and differences between their results discussed.\n\nData Transformation (5.4)\n\nThe decision to transform key variables prior to analysis is best made during the design of the trial on the basis of similar data from earlier clinical trials. Transformations (e.g., square root, logarithm) should be specified in the protocol and a rationale provided, especially for the primary variable(s). The general principles guiding the use of transformations to ensure that the assumptions underlying the statistical methods are met are to be found in standard texts; conventions for particular variables have been developed in a number of specific clinical areas. The decision on whether and how to transform a variable should be influenced by the preference for a scale that facilitates clinical interpretation.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to other derived variables, such as the use of change from baseline, percentage change from baseline, the area under the curve of repeated measures, or the ratio of two different variables. Subsequent clinical interpretation should be carefully considered, and the derivation should be justified in the protocol. Closely related points are made in section II.2.2.\n\nEstimation, Confidence Intervals, and Hypothesis Testing (5.5)\n\nThe statistical section of the protocol should specify the hypotheses that are to be tested and/or the treatment effects that are to be estimated in order to satisfy the primary objectives of the trial. The statistical methods to be used to accomplish these tasks should be described for the primary (and preferably the secondary) variables, and the underlying statistical model should be made clear. Estimates of treatment effects should be accompanied by confidence intervals, whenever possible, and the way in which these will be calculated should be identified. A description should be given of any intentions to use baseline data to improve precision or to adjust estimates for potential baseline differences, for example, by means of analysis of covariance.\n\nIt is important to clarify whether one- or two-sided tests of statistical significance will be used and, in particular, to justify prospectively the use of one-sided tests. If hypothesis tests are not considered appropriate, then the alternative process for arriving at statistical conclusions should be given. The issue of one-sided or two-sided approaches to inference is controversial, and a diversity of views can be found in the statistical literature. The approach of setting Type I errors for one-sided tests at half the conventional Type I error used in two-sided tests is preferable in regulatory settings. This promotes consistency with the two-sided confidence intervals that are generally appropriate for estimating the possible size of the difference between two treatments.\n\nThe particular statistical model chosen should reflect the current state of medical and statistical knowledge about the variables to be analyzed as well as the statistical design of the trial. All effects to be fitted in the analysis (for example, in analysis of variance models) should be fully specified, and the manner, if any, in which this set of effects might be modified in response to preliminary results should be explained. The same considerations apply to the set of covariates fitted in an analysis of covariance. (See also section V.G.) In the choice of statistical methods, due attention should be paid to the statistical distribution of both primary and secondary variables. When making this choice (for example between parametric and nonparametric methods), it is important to bear in mind the need to provide statistical estimates of the size of treatment effects together with confidence intervals (in addition to significance tests).\n\nThe primary analysis of the primary variable should be clearly distinguished from supporting analyses of the primary or secondary variables. Within the statistical section of the protocol or the statistical analysis plan there should also be an outline of the way in which data other than the primary and secondary variables will be summarized and reported. This should include a reference to any approaches adopted for the purpose of achieving consistency of analysis across a range of trials, for example, for safety data.\n\nModeling approaches that incorporate information on known pharmacological parameters, the extent of protocol compliance for individual subjects, or other biologically based data may provide valuable insights into actual or potential efficacy, especially with regard to estimation of treatment effects. The assumptions underlying such models should always be clearly identified, and the limitations of any conclusions should be carefully described.\n\nAdjustment of Significance and Confidence Levels (5.6)\n\nWhen multiplicity is present, the usual frequentist approach to the analysis of clinical trial data may necessitate an adjustment to the Type I error. Multiplicity may arise, for example, from multiple primary variables (see section II.B.2), multiple comparisons of treatments, repeated evaluation over time, and/or interim analyses (see section IV.E). Methods to avoid or reduce multiplicity are sometimes preferable when available, such as the identification of the key primary variable (multiple variables), the choice of a critical treatment contrast (multiple comparisons), and the use of a summary measure such as area under the curve (repeated measures). In confirmatory analyses, any aspects of multiplicity that remain after steps of this kind have been taken should be identified in the protocol; adjustment should always be considered and the details of any adjustment procedure or an explanation of why adjustment is not thought to be necessary should be set out in the analysis plan.\n\nSubgroups, Interactions, and Covariates (5.7)\n\nThe primary variable(s) is often systematically related to other influences apart from treatment. For example, there may be relationships to covariates such as age and sex, or there may be differences between specific subgroups of subjects, such as those treated at the different centers of a multicenter trial. In some instances, an adjustment for the influence of covariates or for subgroup effects is an integral part of the planned analysis and hence should be set out in the protocol. Pretrial deliberations should identify those covariates and factors expected to have an important influence on the primary variable(s), and should consider how to account for these in the analysis to improve precision and to compensate for any lack of balance between treatment groups. If one or more factors are used to stratify the design, it is appropriate to account for those factors in the analysis. When the potential value of an adjustment is in doubt, it is often advisable to nominate the unadjusted analysis as the one for primary attention, the adjusted analysis being supportive. Special attention should be paid to center effects and to the role of baseline measurements of the primary variable. It is not advisable to adjust the main analyses for covariates measured after randomization because they may be affected by the treatments.\n\nThe treatment effect itself may also vary with subgroup or covariate. For example, the effect may decrease with age or may be larger in a particular diagnostic category of subjects. In some cases such interactions are anticipated or are of particular prior interest (e.g., geriatrics); hence a subgroup analysis or a statistical model including interactions is part of the planned confirmatory analysis. In most cases, however, subgroup or interaction analyses are exploratory and should be clearly identified as such; they should explore the uniformity of any treatment effects found overall. In general, such analyses should proceed first through the addition of interaction terms to the statistical model in question, complemented by additional exploratory analysis within relevant subgroups of subjects, or within strata defined by the covariates. When exploratory, these analyses should be interpreted cautiously. Any conclusion of treatment efficacy (or lack thereof) or safety based solely on exploratory subgroup analyses is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nH. Integrity of Data and Computer Software Validity (5.8)\n\nThe credibility of the numerical results of the analysis depends on the quality and validity of the methods and software (both internally and externally written) used both for data management (data entry, storage, verification, correction, and retrieval) and for processing the data statistically. Data management activities should therefore be based on thorough and effective standard operating procedures. The computer software used for data management and statistical analysis should be reliable, and documentation of appropriate software testing procedures should be available.\n\nVI. EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY\n\nA. Scope of Evaluation (6.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.805552959442139", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Details of procedures performed by lay-users and study technicians.\n\nInstructions provided to users in the study. (Note: All instructions should be provided to users in English only.)\n\n2.2.2 Data Analyses:\n\nData exclusion and outliers:\n\nYou should present all data in the 510(k) submission, including cases in which the meter displays an error code, a 'High' or 'Low' message, or no result. All outliers (e.g., data points that do not conform to the minimum accuracy criteria) should also be included. You should investigate all outlier results and describe the results of these investigations, providing explanations for the occurrence of outliers when possible. To help inform your investigations into outlier results, you should collect information regarding patient medications, hematocrit measurements, and disease states during your study.\n\n2.2.3 Analysis of results:\n\nYou should present the difference between individual study subject results and results of the comparator method (or mean of the comparator measurement, if multiple replicates are measured on the comparator method) by plotting the data on an X-Y graph. The plot should include the regression line and line of identity. Your summary of results should include the slope and y-intercept, along with 95% confidence intervals, calculated using asuitable analysis procedure (e.g., Linear Regression, Deming Regression), and the estimate of the deviation (standard error). Difference plot of Y-X vs X may also be presented. You should describe all statistical methods used and clearly identify and describe any outliers in the analysis.\n\nTabular data presentation:\n\nYou should present the results of your analysis in the following tabular format for each sample matrix. In Table 2 below, X= the number of samples within the specified difference from the comparator method, and Y= total number of samples.\n\nInterference Evaluation\n\nYou should evaluate the effect of potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances and conditions, such as icterus, lipemia, and varying hematocrit levels, as well as the effect of common medications on your SMBG's performance. Conditions that are known to interfere with glucose monitoring test systems, such as ketoacidosis, should be included in the labeling as limitations. If you would like the labeling to not include these limitations or if you would like to remove these conditions from the labeling, you should provide interference testing demonstrating that these conditions do not interfere with your device.\n\n1. Endogenous/Exogenous Substances\n\nStudy design:\n\nYou should perform interference testing using samples containing glucose concentrations across the range of the device. Specifically, testing should be performed in samples with target glucose values of approximately 50 - 70 mg/dL, 110-130 mg/dL, and 225-270 mg/dL to evaluate clinically relevant decision points.\n\nYou should evaluate each potentially interfering substance at clinically relevant concentrations, and should test all substances at the highest concentration that could potentially be observed in a whole blood sample; if significant interference is observed, you should perform dilutions of the interferent to determine the concentration at which interference begins to occur. For example, if interference is observed with 20 mg/dL acetaminophen, additional testing should be performed with samples containing lower concentrations of acetaminophen, such as 15 mg/dL, 10 mg/dL and 5 mg/dL, to determine the lowest concentration of acetaminophen where interference is first observed. If the results from the additional testing determine that interference is not observed in the sample containing 5 mg/dL acetaminophen and interference is observed in the sample containing 10 mg/dL acetaminophen, then 5 mg/dL is the highest concentration of acetaminophen where no interference is observed.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \\hline Within +/- 5\\% & Within +/- 10\\% & Within +/- 15\\% & Within +/- 20\\% \\ \\hline X/Y (\\%) & X/Y (\\%) & X/Y (\\%) & X/Y (\\%) \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Summary of data within specified mg/dL of the comparator method for glucose concentrations across the entire range:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe substances listed below in Table 3 represent known or potential interferers for current blood glucose measurement technologies and comprise the minimal list of substances that should be tested for interference.\n\nIn addition to the list of potential interferers provided in Table 3, you should conduct an interference risk analysis and carry out bench studies to evaluate interference from additional drugs commonly used in your intended use population. These bench studies of additional drugs should be conducted in the same manner described in this Section.\n\nYou should provide a reliable estimate of the interference predicted for each potential interferent. To do this, we recommend the following method of measuring and calculating interference. First, blood samples should be generated at each target glucose\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \\hline\nInterferent & Recommended Test \\  & Concentration \\ \\hline Acetaminophen & 20 mg/dL \\ \\hline Ascorbic acid & 6 mg/dL \\ \\hline Conjugated Bilirubin & 50 mg/dL \\ \\hline Unconjugated Bilirubin & 40 mg/dL \\ \\hline Cholesterol & 500 mg/dL \\ \\hline Creatinine & 15 mg/dL \\ \\hline Dopamine & 0.09 mg/dL \\ \\hline EDTA({}^{}) & 0.1 mg/dL \\ \\hline Galactose & 60 mg/dL \\ \\hline Gentisic acid & 1.8 mg/dL \\ \\hline Reduced Glutathione & 4.6 mg/dL \\ \\hline Hemoglobin & 1000 mg/dL \\ \\hline Heparin({}^{}) & 300 IU/dL \\ \\hline Ibuprofen & 50 mg/dL \\ \\hline L-Dopa & 0.75 mg/dL \\ \\hline Maltose & 480 mg/dL \\ \\hline Mannitol & 1800 mg/dL \\ \\hline Methyldopa & 2 mg/dL \\ \\hline Salicylic acid & 60 mg/dL \\ \\hline Sodium & 180 mmol/L \\ \\hline Tolbutamide & 72 mg/dL \\ \\hline Tolazamide & 9 mg/dL \\ \\hline Triglycerides & 1500 mg/dL \\ \\hline Uric acid & 23.5 mg/dL \\ \\hline Xylose & 600 mg/dL \\ \\hline Sugar Alcohols({}^{*}) & 0.09 mg/dL \\ \\hline \\end{tabular} ({}^{})The inclusion of EDTA and Heparin in this table refers to their use as therapeutic substances and not as anticoagulants for sample preparation.\n\n({}^{**})All common sugar alcohols, including but not necessarily limited to, sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, isomalt, maltitol should be independently tested.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: List of Known or Potential Interferents for SMBGs:concentration described above. Each glucose sample should be tested in replicates with the comparator method (we suggest at least 4 replicates in order to reduce standard error) to establish the glucose concentration in the sample. The glucose samples should then be split into a test sample to which a specific amount of potential interferent is added and a control sample containing solvent/vehicle in lieu of the potential interfering substance. Both control samples and test samples should be measured in replicates on the SMBG. At least three test strip lots should be used for this evaluation. Each of the control and test samples should be tested on your SMBG in replicates of 30 across the three lots (10 replicates per lot of test strips for a total of 30 replicates per sample). The mean of replicates should be calculated for each control and test sample. The relative bias (mg/dL) and percent bias should be calculated using the results of the control sample relative to test sample for each concentration of potential interferent. These results should be submitted with 95% confidence intervals as part of your 510(k) submission.\n\nFor SMBGs, the degree of acceptable interference may vary by substance tested and the intended patient population of your device. Therefore, you should report in your 510(k) submission the interference testing data as well as the expected imprecision of the system at that glucose concentration. If interferences are observed, you should propose appropriate labeling to address any observed interferences; the labeling language appropriate for the observed interference will be discussed during the review of the 510(k) submission.\n\nAs new drugs are developed that could potentially interfere with your device, or new interfering substances are identified for other SMBGs, you should evaluate these new drugs or substances for potential interference with your device. For example, if a new drug intended to treat cardiac complications in diabetic patients is approved, you should conduct a careful evaluation to determine whether the new drug interferes with your device. You should report to FDA if significant new interferences are observed with your device or with any cleared glucose monitoring devices that are on the market. New drugs/potential interferets should also be evaluated when new or significantly modified technology is introduced.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nYou should provide raw data sets as well as a summary table for all interference results. Please note that the summary tables should be presented separately for each test strip lot and for all lots pooled for each glucose level tested. Table 4 below provides a sample format of a summary table.\n\n2 Hematocrit\n\nStudy Design:\n--------------------\nContext title: Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Test Systems for Over-the-Counter Use Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.479887962341309", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: The full analysis set and the per protocol set play different roles in superiority trials (which seek to show the investigational product to be superior), and in equivalence or non-inferiority trials (which seek to show the investigational product to be comparable, see section 3.3.2). In superiority trials the full analysis set is used in the primary analysis (apart from exceptional circumstances) because it tends to avoid over-optimistic estimates of efficacy resulting from a per protocol analysis, since the non-compliers included in the full analysis set will generally diminish the estimated treatment effect. However, in an equivalence or non-inferiority trial use of the full analysis set is generally not conservative and its role should be considered very carefully.\n\nMissing Values and Outliers\n\nMissing values represent a potential source of bias in a clinical trial. Hence, every effort should be undertaken to fulfil all the requirements of the protocol concerning the collection and management of data. In reality, however, there will almost always be some missing data. A trial may be regarded as valid, nonetheless, provided the methods of dealing with missing values are sensible, and particularly if those methods are pre-defined in the protocol. Definition of methods may be refined by updating this aspect in the statistical analysis plan during the blind review. Unfortunately, no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended. An investigation should be made concerning the sensitivity of the results of analysis to the method of handling missing values, especially if the number of missing values is substantial.\n\nA similar approach should be adopted to exploring the influence of outliers, the statistical definition of which is, to some extent, arbitrary. Clear identification of a particular value as an outlier is most convincing when justified medically as well as statistically, and the medical context will then often define the appropriate action. Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favour any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully updated during blind review. If no procedure for dealing with outliers was foreseen in the trial protocol, one analysis with the actual values and at least one other analysis eliminating or reducing the outlier effect should be performed and differences between their results discussed.\n\nData Transformation\n--------------------\nContext title: E9_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.648905277252197", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.2.2 Outlier Tests\n\nThe CGMP regulations require that statistically valid quality control criteria include appropriate acceptance and/or rejection levels (SS 211.165(d)). On rare occasions, a value may be obtained that is markedly different from the others in a series obtained using a validated method. Such a value may qualify as a statistical outlier. An outlier may result from a deviation from prescribed test methods, or it may be the result of variability in the sample. It should never be assumed that the reason for an outlier is error in the testing procedure, rather than inherent variability in the sample being tested.\n\nOutlier testing is a statistical procedure for identifying from an array those data that are extreme. The possible use of outlier tests should be determined in advance. This should be written into SOPs for data interpretation and be well documented. The SOPs should include the specific outlier test to be applied with relevant parameters specified in advance. The SOPs should specify the minimum number of results required to obtain a statistically significant assessment from the specified outlier test.\n\nFor biological assays having a high variability, an outlier test may be an appropriate statistical analysis to identify those results that are statistically extreme observations. The USP describes outlier tests in the general chapter on Design and Analysis of Biological Assays (USP(<)111(>)). In these cases, the outlier observation is omitted from calculations. The USP also states that \"arbitrary rejection or retention of an apparently aberrant response can be a serious source of bias...the rejection of observations solely on the basis of their relative magnitudes, without investigation as to cause, is a procedure to be used sparingly\" (USP (<)111(>)).\n\nFor validated chemical tests with relatively small variance, and if the sample being tested can be considered homogeneous (for example, an assay of a composite of a dosage form drug to determine strength), an outlier test is only a statistical analysis of the data obtained from testing and retesting. It will not identify the cause of an extreme observation and, therefore, should not be used to invalidate the suspect result. Occasionally, an outlier test may be of some value in understanding how discordant from a data set a result is, but can be used solely in an informational capacity in the course of an investigation to determine the distance of a result from the mean.15\n\nFootnote 15: Outlier testing should not be used to invalidate chemical assays. See United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, U.S.A. v. Barr Laboratories, Inc., et al. Civil Action Number 92-1744, OPINION, February 4, 1993.\n\nOutlier tests have no applicability in cases where the variability in the product is what is being assessed, such as for content uniformity, dissolution, or release rate determinations. In these applications, a value perceived to be an outlier may in fact be an accurate result of a nonuniform product.\n\nWhen using these practices during the additional testing performed in an OOS investigation, the laboratory will obtain multiple results. It is again critical for the laboratory to provide all test results for evaluation and consideration by the QU in itsfinal disposition decision. In addition, when investigation by a contract laboratory16 does not determine an assignable cause, all test results should be reported to the customer on the certificate of analysis.\n\nFootnote 16: The Agency also recommends that OOS investigation reports be provided to the customer.\n\nV Concluding the Investigation\n\nTo conclude the investigation, the results should be evaluated, the batch quality should be determined, and a release decision should be made by the QU. The relevant SOPs should be followed in arriving at this point. Once a batch has been rejected, there is no limit to further testing to determine the cause of the failure so that a corrective action can be taken.\n\nInterpretation of Investigation Results\n\nThe QU is responsible for interpreting the results of the investigation. An initial OOS result does not necessarily mean the subject batch fails and must be rejected. The OOS result should be investigated, and the findings of the investigation, including retest results, should be interpreted to evaluate the batch and reach a decision regarding release or rejection (SS 211.165).\n\nIn those instances where an investigation has revealed a cause, and the suspect result is invalidated, the result should not be used to evaluate the quality of the batch or lot. Invalidation of a discrete test result may be done only upon the observation and documentation of a test event that can reasonably be determined to have caused the OOS result.\n\nIn those cases where the investigation indicates an OOS result is caused by a factor affecting the batch quality (i.e., an OOS result is confirmed), the result should be used in evaluating the quality of the batch or lot. A confirmed OOS result indicates that the batch does not meet established standards or specifications and should result in the batch's rejection, in accordance with SS 211.165(f), and proper disposition. For inconclusive investigations -- in cases where an investigation (1) does not reveal a cause for the OOS test result and (2) does not confirm the OOS result -- the OOS result should be given full consideration in the batch or lot disposition decision.\n\nIn the first case (OOS confirmed), the investigation changes from an OOS investigation into a batch failure investigation, which must be extended to other batches or products that may have been associated with the specific failure (SS 211.192).\n\nIn the second case (inconclusive), the QU might still ultimately decide to release the batch. For example, a firm might consider release of the product under the following scenario:\n\nA product has an acceptable composite assay range of 90.0 to 110.0 percent. The initial (OOS) assay result is 89.5 percent. Subsequent sample preparations from the original sample yield the following retest results: 99.0, 98.9, 99.0, 99.1, 98.8, 99.1, and 99.0 percent. A comprehensive laboratory investigation (Phase 1) fails to reveal any laboratory error. Review of events during production of the batch reveals no aberrations or indication of unusual process variation.17\n\nFootnote 17: As an example, evaluation of process variation would determine if established equipment, facility, and process control limits were met.\n\nReview of the manufacturing process and product history demonstrates that the process is robust. The seven passing retest results are all well within the known limits of variability of the method used. Batch results from in-process monitoring, content uniformity, dissolution, and other tests are consistent with the passing retest results. After a thorough investigation, a firm's QU might conclude that the initial OOS result did not reflect the true quality of the batch.\n\nIt is noteworthy in this scenario that the original, thorough laboratory investigation failed to find any assignable cause. However, if subsequent investigation nonetheless concludes that the source of the OOS result was a cause unrelated to the manufacturing process, in response to this atypical failure to detect the laboratory deviation, it is essential that the investigation include appropriate follow-up and scrutiny to prevent recurrence of the laboratory error(s) that could have led to the OOS result.\n\nAs the above example illustrates, any decision to release a batch, in spite of an initial OOS result that has not been invalidated, should come only after a full investigation has shown that the OOS result does not reflect the quality of the batch. In making such a decision, the QU should always err on the side of caution.\n\nCautious\n\nc.2.1 Averaging results from multiple sample preparations from the original sample\n\nIn cases where a series of assay results (intended to produce a single reportable result) are required by the test procedure and some of the individual results are OOS, some are within specification, and all are within the known variability of the method, the passing results are no more likely to represent the true value for the sample than the OOS results. For this reason, a firm should err on the side of caution and treat the average of these values as an OOS result, even if that average is within specification. This approach is consistent with the principle outlined in the USP General Notices that an official article shall comply with the compential standard any time a compential test is applied.18 Thus, every individual application of the official test should be expected to produce a result that meets specifications.\n\nFootnote 18: USP, General Notices, Section 7.10, \u201cTest Results, Statistics, and Standards\u201d states \u201cAnalytical results observed in the laboratory (or calculated from experimental measurements) are compared with stated acceptance criteria to determine whether the article conforms to compential requirements.\u201d\n\nc.2.2 Averaging results from same final sample preparation\n\nAs noted in the Averaging section (IV.C.1.), there may be cases where the test method specifies appropriate acceptance criteria for variability and a pre-defined number of replicates from the final diluted sample solution to arrive at a result. For example, an HPLC test method may specify both acceptance criteria for variability and that a single reportable result be determined by averaging the peak response from a number of consecutive, replicate injections from the same test vial. In these cases, and given the acceptance criteria for variability are met, the result of any individual replicate in and of itself should not cause the reportable result to be OOS.\n\niv.2.3 Borderline results that are within specification\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.941746234893799", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: In the case of a clearly identified laboratory error, the retest results would substitute for the original test result. However, all original data must be retained (SS 211.180) and an explanation should be recorded.9 This record should be initialed and dated by the involved persons and include a discussion of the error and supervisory comments. (See section III of this guidance for more details on a laboratory investigation.)\n\nFootnote 9: See \u00a7S211.68 and 211.188. See also FDA guidance for industry Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP(December 2018).\n\nIf no laboratory or calculation errors are identified in the first test, there is no scientific basis for invalidating initial OOS results in favor of passing retest results. All test results, both passing and suspect, should be reported10 and considered in batch release decisions.\n\nFootnote 10: In other words, all data are reported in, for example, quality control reports, batch records, Certificates of Analysis, in accordance with \u00a7S211.188 and 211.192.\n\n2.2.2 Resampling\n\nWhile retesting refers to analysis of the original, homogenous sample material, resampling involves analyzing a specimen from any additional units collected as part of the original sampling procedure or from a new sample collected from the batch, should that be necessary.\n\nThe original sample from a batch should be sufficiently large to accommodate additional testing in the event an OOS result is obtained. In some situations, however, it may be appropriate to collect a new sample from the batch. Control mechanisms for examination of additional specimens should be in accordance with predetermined procedures and sampling strategies (SS 211.165(c)).\n\nWhen all data have been evaluated, an investigation might conclude that the original sample was prepared improperly and was therefore not representative of the batch quality (SS 211.160(b)(3)). Improper sample preparation might be indicated, for example, by widely varied results obtained from several aliquots of an original composite (after determining there was no error in the performance of the analysis). Resampling should be performed by the same qualified, validated methods that were used for the initial sample. However, if the investigation determines that the initial sampling method was inherently inadequate, a new accurate sampling method must be developed, documented, and reviewed and approved by the QU (SSSS 211.160 and 211.165(c)).\n\nReporting Testing Results\n\nPractices used in reporting and interpretation of test results include (1) averaging and (2) outlier tests.\n\nAveraging There are both appropriate and inappropriate uses of averaging test data during original testing and during an OOS investigation: a. Appropriate uses Averaging data can be a valid approach, but its use depends upon the sample and its purpose. For example, in an optical rotation test, several discrete measurements are averaged to determine the optical rotation for a sample, and this average is reported as the test result. If the sample can be assumed to be homogeneous, (i.e., an individual sample preparation designed to be homogenous), using averages can provide a more accurate result. In the case of microbiological assays, the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) prefers the use of averages because of the innate variability of the biological test system. It should be noted that a test might consist of a specific number of replicates to arrive at a result. For instance, an HPLC assay result may be determined by averaging the peak responses from a number of consecutive, replicate injections from the same preparation (usually 2 or 3). The assay result would be calculated using the peak response average. This determination is considered one test and one result.11 This is a distinct difference from the analysis of different portions from a lot, intended to determine variability within the lot, and from multiple full analyses of the same homogenous sample. The use of replicates to arrive at a single reportable12 result, and the specific number of replicates used, should be specified in the written, test method approved by the QU. Acceptance limits for variability among the replicates should also be specified in the method. Unexpected variation in replicate determinations should trigger remedial action as required by SS 211.160(b)(4). If acceptance limits for replicate variability are not met, the test results should not be used. In some cases, a series of complete tests (full run-throughs of the test procedure), such as assays, are part of the test method. It may be appropriate to specify in the test method that the average of these multiple assays is considered one test and represents one reportable result. In this case, limits on acceptable variability among the individual assay results should be based on the known variability of the method and should also be specified in the test methodology.13 A set of assay results not meeting these limits should not be used. These appropriate uses of averaging test data should be used during an OOS investigation only if they were used during the original testing that produced the OOS result. b. Inappropriate uses Reliance on averaging has the disadvantage of hiding variability among individual test results. For this reason, all individual test results should normally be reported as separate values. Where averaging of separate tests is appropriately specified by the test method, a single averaged result can be reported as the final test result. In some cases, a statistical treatment of the variability of results is reported. For example, in a test for dosage form content uniformity, the standard deviation (or relative standard deviation) is reported with the individual unit dose test results. Averaging can also conceal variations in different portions of a batch, or within a sample. For example, the use of averages is inappropriate when performing powder blend/mixture uniformity or dosage form content uniformity determinations. In these cases, testing is intended to measure variability within the product, and individual results provide the information for such an evaluation. In the context of additional testing performed during an OOS investigation, averaging the result(s) of the original test that prompted the investigation with additional retest or resample results obtained during the OOS investigation is not appropriate because it hides variability among the individual results. Relying on averages of such data can be particularly misleading when some of the results are OOS and others are within specifications. It is critical that the laboratory provide all individual results for evaluation and consideration by the QU, which is responsible for approving or rejecting, e.g., drug products, in-process materials (SS 211.22). For example, in an assay of a finished drug with a specification of 90 to 110 percent, an initial OOS result of 89 percent followed by additional retest results of 90 percent and 91 percent would produce an average of 90 percent. While this average would meet specification,14 the additional test results also tend to confirm the original OOS result. However, in another situation with the same specifications, an initial OOS result of 80 percent followed by additional test results of 85 percent and 105 percent would also produce an average of 90 percent but present a much different picture. These results do not confirm the original OOS result but show high variability and may not be reliable. In both examples, the individual results, not the average, should be used to evaluate the quality of the product.\n\n3.2.2 Outlier Tests\n\nThe CGMP regulations require that statistically valid quality control criteria include appropriate acceptance and/or rejection levels (SS 211.165(d)). On rare occasions, a value may be obtained that is markedly different from the others in a series obtained using a validated method. Such a value may qualify as a statistical outlier. An outlier may result from a deviation from prescribed test methods, or it may be the result of variability in the sample. It should never be assumed that the reason for an outlier is error in the testing procedure, rather than inherent variability in the sample being tested.\n\nOutlier testing is a statistical procedure for identifying from an array those data that are extreme. The possible use of outlier tests should be determined in advance. This should be written into SOPs for data interpretation and be well documented. The SOPs should include the specific outlier test to be applied with relevant parameters specified in advance. The SOPs should specify the minimum number of results required to obtain a statistically significant assessment from the specified outlier test.\n\nFor biological assays having a high variability, an outlier test may be an appropriate statistical analysis to identify those results that are statistically extreme observations. The USP describes outlier tests in the general chapter on Design and Analysis of Biological Assays (USP(<)111(>)). In these cases, the outlier observation is omitted from calculations. The USP also states that \"arbitrary rejection or retention of an apparently aberrant response can be a serious source of bias...the rejection of observations solely on the basis of their relative magnitudes, without investigation as to cause, is a procedure to be used sparingly\" (USP (<)111(>)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.085357666015625"], "Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: The product labeling;\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:32]\n\nshould also conduct continuing review of the HUD. For continuing review, an IRB may use an expedited review procedure in which a chairperson or one or more experienced reviewers carries out the review, similar to the expedited review procedure described at 21 CFR 56.110(b). When an IRB conducts the initial review, a facility may decide to utilize an appropriate local committee to conduct continuing review of the use of the HUD in clinical care.\n\nAppropriate local committees may develop their own policies and procedures for continuing review of a HUD and should determine what type of review procedure is appropriate for each HUD. An expedited procedure, such as that described under 21 CFR 56.110, may be appropriate for continuing review because a HUD marketed under an HDE is a legally marketed device, and its use in clinical care does not constitute \"research.\" An expedited review does not mean a less-than-substantive review. The individual(s) conducting an expedited review for use of a HUD at a facility should thoughtfully consider the risk and benefit information available and any MDRs.\n\nIn addition, FDA does not require that the IRB or appropriate local committee serve as a Data Monitoring Committee. The IRB or appropriate local committee may, however, ask the HDE holder for copies of the safety information submitted to FDA in the periodic reports required by 21 CFR 814.126(b)(1). In this way, information that could have a bearing on human safety would be considered at the time of continuing review.\n\nWhen an IRB or appropriate local committee is deciding whether to approve the use of a HUD for clinical care of patients at a facility, it does not make a Significant Risk/Non-Significant Risk (SR/NSR) determination. As noted above, use of a legally marketed HUD within its HDE-approved indication at a facility to treat or diagnose patients is not a clinical investigation of a device under 21 CFR part 812.\n\nAppendix F Review and Approval for Clinical Testing of HUDs\n\nA clinical investigation of a HUD that requires submission of an IDE application to FDA or is conducted under the abbreviated requirements for NSR devices at 21 CFR 812.2(b) must be approved and supervised by an IRB.109 Data may be collected in a clinical investigation for the HDE-approved indication(s) without an IDE. An approved IDE permits a device to be shipped lawfully for the purposes of conducting investigations of the device without complying with certain other requirements of the FD&C Act that would apply to devices in commercial distribution.110 As long as the HUD is being studied for the indication(s) in its approved labeling, the HUD is not subject to IDE requirements because the HUD is a legally marketed device and therefore can be lawfully shipped without an IDE. However, regardless of the applicability of the IDE regulation at 21 CFR part 812, other FDA regulatory requirements may still apply, includingrequirements for IRB review and approval, financial disclosure, informed consent111 and, if applicable, additional safeguards for children.112\n\nFootnote 111: Specific requirements for obtaining informed consent from human subjects apply to FDA-regulated clinical investigations. See 21 CFR part 50, subpart B. Note that, in some cases, facilities may have specific requirements for obtaining informed consent for the use of the HDE-approved HUD in the routine clinical care of patients, but these would not be FDA regulatory requirements.\n\nFootnote 112: See 21 CFR part 56 for IRB requirements; see 21 CFR part 54 for requirements for financial disclosure by clinical investigators; and see 21 CFR part 50 for requirements for the protection of human subjects, including additional safeguards for children.\n\nIf the IRB receives a request to review an investigation to determine safety or effectiveness of the HUD for a different indication than the HDE-approved indication(s), then the IRB should be aware that this type of clinical investigation is subject to the IDE regulations at 21 CFR part 812. If the device is a SR device, the sponsor of the investigation must submit an IDE application to FDA and obtain FDA approval of that application before starting the clinical investigation.113 A physician who wants to study a HUD may be the sponsor, investigator, or both for the study. In sum, the investigational use of a HUD under these circumstances must be conducted in accordance with 21 CFR parts 812, 50, 54, and 56.114\n\nFootnote 113: 21 CFR 812.20(a).\n\nFootnote 114: Note that 45 CFR part 46 may be applicable to research involving HUDs under certain circumstances. The applicability of those regulations is outside the scope of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 115: See 21 CFR 812.66.\n\nSignificant Risk/Non-Significant Risk Determinations\n\nAn IRB does not have to make a SR/NSR determination when it receives a request to review a clinical investigation of a HUD (e.g., collection of safety and effectiveness data) when that clinical investigation concerns the HDE-approved indication(s) only. As noted above, FDA does not consider such investigations to require an IDE under 21 CFR part 812.\n\nFor an investigation of the HUD for indications other than the HDE-approved indication(s), the IRB would need to make a SR/NSR determination if that determination has not already been made by FDA.115 In practice, most sponsors have submitted and obtained FDA approval of an IDE application before submitting such investigations of HUDs to IRBs for review, so IRBs have not needed to make the SR/NSR determination (i.e., FDA had already determined the device was a SR device). However, in the event that a sponsor seeks IRB approval for investigational use of a HUD for an indication other than its approved indication(s) without first obtaining a determination from FDA regarding whether the study is a SR or NSR study, then the IRB should make the SR/NSR determination as required in 21 CFR 812.66.\n\nFootnote 115: See 21 CFR 812.66.\n\nAppendix G Emergency Use of HUDs\n\nIf a physician in an emergency situation determines that IRB or appropriate local committee approval for the use of the HUD at the facility cannot be obtained in time to prevent serious harm or death to a patient, a HUD may be used without prior approval. In this situation, the HDEholder may ship the HUD, based on the physician's certification of the emergent need and representation that the physician will follow the requirements regarding reporting such use to the chairperson of the IRB or appropriate local committee. The physician must provide notification of the use to the chairperson of the IRB or appropriate local committee, and the notification must include the identification of the patient involved, the date of the use, and the reason for the use.116 FDA regulations require that physicians provide such notification to the chairperson of an IRB in writing within 5 days of the emergency use of the device.117 For facilities at which an appropriate local committee reviews the use of HUDs instead of an IRB, FDA recommends that physicians provide the same required notification of the emergency use to the committee in writing and within 5 days.\n\nFootnote 116: See section 520(m)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA further recommends that the physician submit a follow-up report on the patient's condition to the HDE holder. The HDE holder is required under 21 CFR 814.126(b) to submit periodic reports, including the applicant's clinical experience with the device and the number of devices shipped or sold in the US.\n\nIX Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 100 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

The OMB control number for this information collection is 0910-0661 (expires 09/30/2022).\n\nAppendix A - Checklist for Filing Review for HDEs\n\n(should be completed within 30 days of DCC receipt)\n\nHDE Number:\n\nHUD Number (from OOPD):\n\nDevice:\n\nProcode:\n\nCompany Name/Address:\n\nContact Name/Phone Numbers:\n\nFDA Staff Member Name:\n\nDecision: FDA Staff Recommendation: File\n\nNot File\n\nWithin 15 calendar days of receipt of the HDE application, FDA staff should answer the preliminary questions below, which are used as an initial screening of the HDE application. Depending upon the answers to these preliminary questions, the remainder of the filing review may or may not be necessary. If the responses to the preliminary questions and subsequent consultation with FDA staff identified below indicate that the HDE filing review should not continue, the FDA staff member or the CBER regulatory project manager (RPM) should promptly inform the FDA team (including consulting reviewers and management) and notify the requester using proper administrative procedures.\n\nPreliminary Questions\n\nAnswers in the shaded blocks indicate consultation with an identified Center advisor is needed.\n\nYes\n\nNo\n--------------------\nContext title: Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.03262748569250107", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Research interactions that involve no more than minimal risk to subjects (e.g., quality of life surveys); and\n\nCollection of follow-up data from procedures or interventions that would have been done as part of routine clinical practice to monitor a subject for disease progression or recurrence, regardless of whether the procedures or interventions are described in the research protocol.\n\nIn contrast, FDA interprets \"long-term follow-up\" to exclude:\n\nResearch interventions that would not have been performed for clinical purposes, even if the research interventions involve no more than minimal risk.\n\nOf note, some studies that are not eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a) at the time of continuing review may be eligible for expedited review under one of the other expedited review categories. For example, if a study's only remaining activity involves long-term follow-up of subjects by drawing 15 ml of blood once annually for a test that is not part of routine clinical practice, such research would not be eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a), but might be eligible for expedited review under category (2).\n\nExpedited review category (8)(b)\n\nIRBs conducting continuing review should be aware that if a study previously received expedited continuing review under category (8)(b), but has now begun enrolling subjects, the study may need to be referred for review by the IRB at a convened meeting. The criterion that \"no additional risks have been identified\" is interpreted by FDA to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB has identified any additional risks in the research from any relevant source20 since the IRB's most recent prior review.\n\nFootnote 20: For example, \u201cany relevant source\u201d would include a review of scientific literature or adverse event reports by the IRB or investigator, as well as communication with FDA or the sponsor.\n\nExpedited review category (8)(c)\n\nFDA notes that the process for conducting continuing review of research eligible under expedited review category (8)(c) can be accomplished through a simple, abbreviated process. For example, if the study is no longer enrolling subjects, all subjects have completed all protocol required visits, and no new data is being collected, and the investigator's sole activity is data analysis, the investigator, as part of the continuing review process, could provide to the IRB the following statement regarding the research: \"The study only involves data analysis, which is proceeding in accordance with the IRB-approved research protocol, and there are no problems to report.\" This statement could be provided by email or as part of a standard continuing review application form. Upon receipt of such a statement from the investigator, the IRB chairperson, or other member(s) designated by the chairperson, under the expedited review procedure, may approve continuation of the research project for another year without further deliberation or review.\n\nOnce the data collection from all trial sites is complete and the overall study results database has been locked and the only remaining activity is analysis of the aggregate data by the study sponsor, further continuing review of the research is generally no longer required.\n\n4.4.2 Expedited Review Category (9)\n\nSimilar to review category (1)21 for initial review, under category (9), an expedited review procedure may be used for the continuing review of research previously approved by the IRB at a convened meeting that meets the following conditions:\n\nFootnote 21: Category 1 research addresses \u201c(1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met: (a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)\n\nThe research is not conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application or an investigational device exemption (IDE);\n\nExpedited review categories (2) through (8) do not apply to the research;\n\nThe IRB has documented at a convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk to the subjects; and\n\nNo additional risks have been identified.\n\nWith regard to the third condition, the IRB at a convened meeting must have determined that either (a) the research project as a whole involved no more than minimal risk, or (b) the remaining research activities present no more than minimal risk to human subjects. With regard to multi-site studies, the fourth condition, that no additional risks have been identified, is interpreted to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB at a particular institution has identified any additional risks of the research based on information from any other institution engaged in the research project or from any other relevant source since the IRB's most recent prior review.\n\nFrequency of Continuing Review\n\nUnder 21 CFR 56.108(a)(2) and 56.109(f), the IRB must determine the frequency of continuing review for each clinical investigation to ensure the continued protection of the rights and welfare of research subjects. FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.109(f) require an IRB to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk posed to the subjects, but not less than once a year.\n\nMore frequent review (i.e., more frequently than once per year) is appropriate, for example, when the risks to subjects require close monitoring. The IRB should consider the factors set forth below when deciding on an appropriate interval for continuing review. These factors should be outlined in the IRB's written procedures for deciding on the frequency of continuing review:\n\nThe nature of and any risks posed by the clinical investigation;\n\nThe degree of uncertainty regarding the risks involved;\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe vulnerability of the subject population;\n\nThe experience of the clinical investigator in conducting clinical research;\n\nThe IRB's previous experience with that investigator and/or sponsor (e.g., compliance history, previous problems with the investigator obtaining informed consent, prior complaints from subjects about the investigator);\n\nThe projected rate of enrollment; and\n\nWhether the study involve novel therapies.\n\nAt the time of initial approval of the study, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the investigator of the interval at which continuing review will occur (at least annually) and the date by which continuing review must occur. Similarly, at the time of continuing review, the IRB should consider whether the current frequency of continuing review for the study is adequate or should be adjusted. In addition to specifying a time interval, the IRB may also specify a subject enrollment number as a threshold for determining when continuing review is to occur. For example, at the time of initial review and approval of a high-risk clinical trial, the IRB might require that continuing review occur either in 6 months or after 5 subjects have been enrolled, whichever occurs first. However, if the continuing review interval is described in relation to a subject enrollment number, it must at a minimum also provide for continuing review annually, regardless of the number of subjects enrolled at that time; it is therefore not acceptable to describe the review interval solely in relation to a number of subjects enrolled. The minutes of IRB meetings should clearly document the approval period (continuing review interval).\n\nThe IRB's determinations regarding the approval of research must be communicated to the investigator in writing (21 CFR 56.109(e)). This written determination should also notify the investigator of the required interval for, and expected date of, continuing review.\n\nDetermining the Effective Date of Initial IRB Approval and the Dates for Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review must occur at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less frequently than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should establish written procedures for informing investigators of the FDA's regulations and the IRB's own policies and procedures on continuing review requirements. (See 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) & (2).) This applies whether a study is reviewed by the convened IRB or through an expedited process.\n\nThe IRB's written procedures should describe how the IRB determines the effective date of approval for the study and how the date and period of approval will be communicated to the clinical investigator.\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research Without Conditions at a\n\nConvened Meeting\n\nWhen the IRB conducts the initial review of a study at a convened meeting and approves the research for one year without requiring either (a) changes to the protocol or informed consent document(s), or (b) submission of clarifications or additional documents, the effective date of the initial approval is the date of that IRB meeting. In such circumstances, the expiration date of theinitial approval period and the date by which the first continuing review must occur may be as late as one year after the date of the IRB meeting at which the research initially was approved (21 CFR 56.109(f)).\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research With Conditions at a Convened IRB Meeting Without Requiring Further Review at a Subsequent Convened Meeting\n\nA much more common scenario is when an IRB conducting the initial review of a research project at a convened meeting takes the following set of actions:\n\nApproves the project for one year;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6647751331329346", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: This formal review of the research effort, as required under 21 CFR 56.109(f), is the subject of this guidance. An IRB must review previously approved research at least once a year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). Review must be conducted at convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, unless the research qualifies for review through an expedited process (21 CFR 56.108(c) and 56.110). See Section III.D. of this guidance for more information on the application of expedited review procedures to continuing review.\n\nIRBs involved in multi-site studies may find it difficult to conduct a thorough review with data solely from the site(s) under their purview and may need to obtain study-wide information. Sponsors are in the unique position of having information for the entire study6 and may provide it to investigators, who in turn provide it to the IRBs. FDA's regulations do not prohibit sponsors from providing study-wide information directly to IRBs.7 FDA encourages efforts by investigators and sponsors to ensure that IRBs receive meaningful study-wide information, particularly when doing so may assist IRBs in reviewing the studies and protecting subjects.\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cAdverse Event Reporting to IRBs \u2013 Improving Human Subject Protection,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126572.pdf.\n\nFootnote 7: Note that FDA\u2019s regulations for device studies specifically assign general responsibility to sponsors \u201c...for ensuring IRB review and approval are obtained and ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation...\u201d 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nOne way to enable a useful continuing review of multi-site studies while reducing or eliminating duplication of effort is through the use of cooperative review agreements or other mechanisms (e.g., using a centralized IRB review process), in accordance with 21 CFR 56.114. Cooperative agreements may vary with respect to how continuing review will be carried out. For example, some agreements may designate a specific IRB as having primary responsibility for continuing review of an investigation.8 Other agreements may assign responsibility for local issues to the institution's IRB, but assign the remaining aspects of continuing review to a central IRB.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cUsing a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080606.pdf.\n\nWhatever the arrangement, the IRB(s) responsible for continuing review of multi-site studies may find it helpful to obtain and review information across the entire study. For additional discussion, see Section III.B. of this guidance.\n\nAppendix A Criteria for Approving Research During Continuing Review\n\nFDA regulations set forth the criteria for IRB approval of research (21 CFR 56.111). These criteria apply to both initial review and continuing review. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of following requirements are satisfied:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized;\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result;\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable;\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and appropriately documented;\n\nWhere appropriate, the research plan adequately provides for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects;\n\nWhere appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data;\n\nAppropriate additional safeguards are included to protect vulnerable subjects; and\n\nWhere the study involves children, the research complies with 21 CFR part 50, Subpart D.\n\nThe IRB makes its continuing review determination by considering whether any new information is available that would affect the IRB's prior finding that the research meets the criteria in 21 CFR 56.111. IRBs have authority to disapprove or require modifications in (to secure re- approval of) a research activity that does not meet any of the above criteria (e.g., the full study or any part thereof, such as changes to the protocol, advertisements; 21 CFR 56.109(a))\n\nAppendix B Process for Conducting Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review takes place at a convened meeting of the IRB, unless it meets the criteria for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110. (See 21 CFR 56.108(c) and Section III.D. of this guidance.) The IRB is required to review the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)) and must maintain records of its continuing review activities, including minutes of meetings at which such activities are undertaken (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) and (3)). The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show actions taken by the IRB, and the vote on these actions, and to summarize the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For research to be approved, a majority of IRB members present at a meeting must approve it (21 CFR 56.108(c)).\n\nThe IRB must ensure that a member does not participate in the IRB's continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB (21 CFR 56.107(e)). Meeting minutes must reflect meeting attendance, the votes taken, and a summary of the discussion and resolution of controverted issues, and should provide confirmation that conflicted members did not participate in the IRB's continuing review of their studies (21 CFR 56.115((a)(2)). FDA recommends that IRB members with a conflicting interest in a project recuse themselves by leaving the meeting room when the IRB conducts continuing review of that project, except when requested by the IRB to be present to provide information.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis IRB member recusal should be noted in the minutes of the IRB meeting when recording votes on IRB actions.\n\nAn IRB must maintain and follow written procedures for the continuing review of research (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) and 56.115(a)(6)). In developing procedures for continuing review, the IRB should consider the use of templates, checklists, or other tools to standardize the request for information or list of materials to be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that studies they conduct comply with applicable regulatory requirements.9 To ensure that the reviewing IRB can carry out its review prior to the expiration date of the current IRB approval, investigators should follow the IRB's policies and procedures for continuing IRB review of research (procedures required by 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1)), in particular by submitting materials and information required by the IRB. FDA encourages IRBs to make investigators aware of the IRB's procedures, for example, by enclosing a copy in correspondence informing the investigator of the IRB's decisions, or posting the information on a website.\n\nFootnote 9: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.60, 312.66, 812.36(c)(viii), 812.100, 812.110(b), 812.40, and 812.43(c)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recommends that the IRB's written procedures call for submission of the following information for consideration by the IRB in continuing review, if not already available to the IRB as part of the existing IRB records for the research10:\n\nFootnote 10: Some of this information may come from the sponsor, who would have access to data across all study sites. Sponsors may provide information directly to IRBs or to the clinical investigators who in turn would share it with the IRBs.\n\nA written progress report/brief project summary that includes the following or references other documents made available to the IRB:\n\nThe number of subjects accrued; (For multi-site studies, the number of subjects accrued at the local site and the number accrued study-wide, if available, should be provided.)\n\nA brief summary of any amendments to the research approved by the IRB since the IRB's initial review or the last continuing review;\n\nAny new and relevant information, published or unpublished, since the last IRB review, especially information about risks associated with the research; (Note that FDA does not expect the IRB to perform an independent review of the relevant scientific literature related to a particular research project undergoing continuing review.)\n\nA summary of any unanticipated problems.11 In many cases, such a summary could be a brief statement that there have been no unanticipated problems (i.e., adverse events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as documented in the research protocol, the informed consent document, and Investigator's Brochure (if applicable)); *\n(\\circ) A summary of any subject withdrawals from the research since the last IRB review, and the reasons for withdrawal, if known; and (\\circ) A summary of any complaints about the research from subjects enrolled at the local site since the last IRB review;\n\nThe latest version of the protocol and sample informed consent document(s) in use at the site;\n\nAny proposed modifications to the informed consent document or protocol;\n\nThe current Investigator's Brochure, if any, including any modifications;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7593011856079102", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: ACTIVITY\n\nWRITTEN PROCEDURE?\n\nCheck yes if the IRB or institution/HRP has a written procedure on this topic, no if it does not, and NA if not applicable.\n\nI.

The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a \"primary reviewer\" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe \"primary reviewer\" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n\nSome IRBs are also exploring the use of electronic submissions and computer access for IRB members. Whatever system the IRB develops and uses, it must ensure that each study receives an adequate review and that the rights and welfare of the subjects are protected.\n\n22. Are sponsors allowed access to IRB written procedures, minutes and membership rosters?\n\nThe FDA regulations do not require public or sponsor access to IRB records. However, FDA does not prohibit the sponsor from requesting IRB records. The IRB and the institution may establish a policy on whether minutes or a pertinent portion of the minutes are provided to sponsors.\n\nBecause of variability, each IRB also needs to be aware of State and local laws regarding access to IRB records.\n\nMust an investigator's brochure be included in the documentation when an IRB reviews an investigational drug study?\n\nFor studies conducted under an investigational new drug application, an investigator's brochure is usually required by FDA [21 CFR 312.23(a)(5) and 312-55]. Even though 21 CFR part 56 does not mention the investigator's brochure by name, much of the information contained in such brochures is clearly required to be reviewed by the IRB. The regulations do outline the criteria for IRB approval of research. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(1) requires the IRB to assure that risks to the subjects are minimized. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2) requires the IRB to assure that the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits. The risks cannot be adequately evaluated without review of the results of previous animal and human studies, which are summarized in the investigator's brochure.\n\nThere is no specific regulatory requirement that the Investigator's Brochure be submitted to the IRB. There are regulatory requirements for submission of information which normally is included in the Investigator's Brochure. It is common that the Investigator's Brochure is submitted to the IRB, and the IRB may establish written procedures which require its submission. Investigator's Brochures may be part of the investigational plan that the IRB reviews when reviewing medical device studies.\n\nTo what extent is the IRB expected to actively audit and monitor the performance of the investigator with respect to human subject protection issues?\n\nFDA does not expect IRBs to routinely observe consent interviews, observe the conduct of the study or review study records. However, 21 CFR 56.109(f) gives the IRB the authority to observe, or have a third party observe, the consent process and the research. When and if the IRB is concerned about the conduct of the study or the process for obtaining consent, the IRB may consider whether, as part of providing adequate oversight of the study, an active audit is warranted.\n\nHow can a sponsor know whether an IRB has been inspected by FDA, and the results of the inspection?\n\nThe Division of Scientific Investigations, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, maintains an inventory of the IRBs that have been inspected, including dates of inspection and classification. The Division recently began including the results of inspections assigned by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This information is available through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) procedures. Once an investigational file has been closed, the correspondence between FDA and the IRB and the narrative inspectional report are also available under FOI.\n\nIf an IRB disapproves a study submitted to it, and it is subsequently sent to another IRB for review, should the second IRB be told of the disapproval? Yes. When an IRB disapproves a study, it must provide a written statement of the reasons for its decision to the investigator and the institution [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. If the study is submitted to a second IRB, a copy of this written statement should be included with the study documentation so that it can make an informed decision about the study. 21 CFR 56.109(a) requires an IRB to \"... review... all research activities [emphasis added]...\" The FDA regulations do not prohibit submission of a study to another IRB following disapproval. However, all pertinent information about the study should be provided to the second IRB. 27. May an independent IRB review a study to be conducted in an institution with an IRB? Generally, no. Most institutional IRB have jurisdiction over all studies conducted within that institution. An independent IRB may become the IRB of record for such studies only upon written agreement with the administration of the institution or the in-house IRB. 28. Could an IRB lose its quorum when members with a conflict of interest leave the room for deliberation and voting on a study? Yes. \"The quorum is the count of the number of members present. If the number present falls below a majority, the quorum fails. The regulations only require that a member who is conflicted not participate in the deliberations and voting on a study on which he or she is conflicted. The IRB may decide whether an individual should remain in the room.\" 29. Does FDA expect the IRB chair to sign the approval letters? FDA does not specify the procedure that IRBs must use regarding signature of the IRB approval letter. The written operating procedures for the IRB should outline the procedure that is followed. 30. Does FDA prohibit direct communication between sponsors and IRBs? It is important that a formal line of communication be established between the clinical investigator and the IRB. Clinical investigators should report adverse events directly to the responsible IRB, and should send progress reports directly to that IRB. However, FDA does not prohibit direct communication between the sponsor and the IRB, and recognizes that doing so could result in more efficient resolution of some problems. FDA does require direct communication between the sponsors and the IRBs for certain studies of medical devices and when the 21 CFR 50.24 informed consent waiver has been invoked. Sponsors and IRBs are required to communicate directly for medical device studies under 21 CFR 812.2, 812.66 and 812.150(b). For informed consent waiver studies, direct communication between sponsors and IRBs is required under 21 CFR 50.24(e), 56.109(e), 56.109(g), 56.109(g), 312.54(b), 312.130(d), 812.38(b)(4) and 812.47(b).\n\nIV IRB Records\n\n31. Are annual IRB reviews required when all studies are reviewed by the IRB each quarter?\n\nThe IRB records for each study's initial and continuing review should note the frequency (not to exceed one year) for the next continuing review in either months or other conditions, such as after a particular number of subjects are enrolled.\n\nAn IRB may decide, to review all studies on a quarterly basis. If every quarterly report contains sufficient information for an adequate continuing review and is reviewed by the IRB under procedures that meet FDA requirements for continuing review, FDA would not require an additional \"annual\" review.\n\n21 CFR 56.115(a)(1) requires that the IRB maintain copies of \"research proposals reviewed.\" Is the \"research proposal\" the same as the formal study protocol that the investigator receives from the sponsor of the research?\n\nYes. The IRB should receive and review all research activities [21 CFR 56.109(a)]. The documents reviewed should include the complete documents received from the clinical investigator, such as the protocol, the investigator's brochure, a sample consent document and any advertising intended to be seen or heard by prospective study subjects. Some IRBs also require the investigator to submit an institutionally-developed protocol summary form.

Statutory Authority\n\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) (Title II of Public Law 108-282) amended the FD&C Act by defining the term \"major food allergen\" and stating that foods regulated under the FD&C Act are misbranded unless they declare the presence of each major food allergen on the product label using the common or usual name of that major food allergen. Section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) now defines a major food allergen as \"[m]ilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and soybeans\" and also as a food ingredient that contains protein derived from these foods. The definition excludes any highly refined oil derived from a major food allergen and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil.\n\nIn some cases, the production of an ingredient derived from a major food allergen may alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins in that derived ingredient to such an extent that it does not contain allergenic protein. In addition, a major food allergen may be used as an ingredient or as a component of an ingredient such that the level of allergenic protein in finished food products does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health. Therefore, FALCPA provides two mechanisms through which such ingredients may become exempt from the labeling requirement of section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. An ingredient may obtain an exemption through submission and approval of a petition containing scientific evidence that demonstrates that the ingredient \"does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health\" (section 403(w)(6) of the FD&C Act). This section also states that \"the burden shall be on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that such food ingredient, as derived by the method specified in the petition, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\" Alternately, an ingredient may become exempt through submission of a notification containing scientific evidence showing that the ingredient \"does not contain allergenic protein\" or that there has been a previous determination through a premarket approval process under section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient \"does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health\" (section 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act).\n\nTo evaluate these petitions and notifications, we will consider scientific evidence that describes:\n\nThe identity or composition of the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to produce the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to characterize the ingredient;\n\nThe intended use of the ingredient in food; and\n\nFor a petition, data and information, including the expected level of consumer exposure to the ingredient, that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured and used as described does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or 5b. For a notification, data and information that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured as described does not contain allergenic protein, or documentation of a previous determination under a process pursuant to section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\n\nWe will evaluate this scientific evidence only for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\nFDA recognizes that there are several methods that can be used to demonstrate that an ingredient meets the standards in 403(w)(6) and 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act. Each submitter may determine which approach is most appropriate for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\n3 Recommendations for Preparing Submissions\n\nDetermining Need for Submission\n\nThe following points should be considered in determining whether to submit a petition or notification:\n\nAn ingredient derived from a major food allergen that does not contain protein is not subject to the labeling requirements described in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. We are aware that there are some technologies (e.g., distillation) that may be able to produce protein-free ingredients because of the nature of the process and fundamental biochemical properties of proteins, peptides, and amino acids. When other technologies are used to produce an ingredient, information and expertise available to the manufacturer should make it possible to identify and apply the appropriate analytic methods to ensure that the ingredient does not contain protein. The methods used should be shown to be sufficiently accurate and sensitive under the conditions of use, including consideration of extraction efficiencies and possible interferences, should be scientifically appropriate, and sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate that no proteins or peptide fragments are present in the ingredient. Manufacturers should also consider potential batch to batch variation in the composition of the ingredient. Manufacturers may discuss methodological issues with us.\n\nA petition should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient derived from a major food allergen that may contain allergenic proteins, or derivatives of allergenic proteins such as peptide fragments, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health in food allergic individuals.\n\nA notification should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient that may contain proteins or protein fragments derived from a major food allergen does not contain allergenic protein.\n\nGeneral\n\nEach submission should contain information identifying the organization and individual primarily responsible for the submission. This should include the name of the individual and organization, a complete mailing address, a physical address if this differs from the mailing address, phone and fax numbers, and an electronic mail (email) address for the organization and for a primary contact. A joint submission from several organizations should include complete information for each organization.\n\nIngredient Description\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance document, ingredients include substances that are-\n\nDerived (e.g., through chemical, biochemical, mechanical, fermentation or bioengineering processes) from a major food allergen and that contain proteins or peptides\n\nA submission should provide a complete description of the ingredient including-\n\nBoth the common or usual name and any scientific name(s) of the ingredient;\n\nThe major food allergen source of the ingredient, if this is not obvious from the name, or the major food allergen sources used in the manufacture or engineering of the ingredient;\n\nThe chemical and biological properties or characteristics of the ingredient including molecular structure, sequence, etc., as appropriate;\n\nAny existing food standards of identity or specifications for the ingredient, such as from the FDA's food standards of identity regulations, Food Chemicals Codex, or Codex Alimentarius; and\n\nThe composition of the ingredient, including the methods used to determine composition, and batch-to-batch variation in composition should be described. If the ingredient contains more than one component, all components, including non-allergens, (including carriers or diluents), as well as the relative proportion of each in the ingredient should be described.\n\nIngredient Preparation or Manufacture\n\nThe method(s) or procedure(s) used to prepare or manufacture the ingredient should be described completely, particularly those steps that alter the amount, relative composition, or biochemical state of the proteins present. This description should include, for example-\n\nsuch as grinding, pressing, filtration;\n\nsuch as heating, cooking, baking, retorting;\n\nsuch as solvent extraction, hydrolysis (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic), cross-linking;\n\nsuch as the composition of the growth or nutrient media used in the manufacture of enzymes or organisms; and/or\n\nsuch as details of the construct, transformation event, and DNA and amino acid sequences.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing or preparation process should include-\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.886749029159546", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor (e.g., Imported by ABC Brewers, Chicago, IL 52705) (21 CFR 101.5);\n\nIn the statement of ingredients: the common or usual name of each ingredient if the product is made from two or more ingredients, in descending order of predominance by weight (e.g., Ingredients: sorghum, water, rice, yeast, molasses, FD&C Yellow No. 5) (21 CFR 101.4). This includes, but is not limited to, the following ingredients: (a) name of any chemical preservatives present and a description of the function of the preservative (e.g., Ingredients: sorghum, water, rice, yeast, molasses, ascorbic acid to promote color retention), as specified in 21 CFR 101.22(j); (b) a declaration of any added coloring, as specified in 21 CFR 101.22(k), and (c) a declaration of added flavor, such as any spices, natural flavors, or artificial flavors, as specified in 21 CFR 101.22(h); and\n\nNutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9) unless exempt. (Note: Some products are exempt under the provisions in 21 CFR 101.9(j)).4 Footnote 4: Food products may qualify for an exemption from nutrition labeling based on the fact that the firm claiming the exemption is a small business. For FDA\u2019s requirements for a small business exemption from nutrition labeling, see \u201cSmall Business Nutrition Labeling Exemption\u201d (available at https://www.fda.gov/food/labeling-nutrition-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/small-business-nutrition-labeling-exemption).\n\nAll of the FDA mandatory label information must appear either on the principal display panel (21 CFR 101.1) or the information panel (21 CFR 101.2) unless otherwise specified by FDA regulation. Furthermore, all information appearing on the information panel must appear in one place without other intervening material (21 CFR 101.2(e)).\n\nThere are other FDA labeling provisions in addition to the requirements listed above. Under the labeling requirements of the FD&C Act, the food source name of any \"major food allergen\" present must be declared (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)). The FD&C Act defines \"major food allergen\" as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of them, with the exception of highly refined oils (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)).

For more information regarding FDA's general labeling requirements, see FDA's \"Food Labeling Guide\" (available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-food-labeling-guide).\n\nThere are no preclearance labeling requirements or certificate of label approvals for FDA regulated food products.6 Instead, manufacturers are responsible for ensuring that their labels conform to all applicable FDA labeling laws and regulations. Products that do not meet these labeling requirements may be subject to regulatory action (e.g., warning letter, seizure, etc.).\n\nFootnote 6: By contrast, TTB has alcohol beverage labeling and taxing authorities that include, for example, premarket label review and approval.\n\nThere are also labeling requirements for these non-malt beverage beers that are enforced by other government agencies.

Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) provides that labeling is misleading if, among other things, it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual. 21 U.S.C. SS 321(n). In a 1992 \"Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties\" (1992 Policy) (Ref. 5) FDA explained its interpretation of the FD&C Act with respect to foods derived from new plant varieties, including varieties developed using bioengineering. In the 1992 Policy, FDA stated that it was not aware of any information showing that bioengineered foods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding (Ref. 5). Further, FDA concluded that the method of development of a new plant variety (including the use of new techniques such as rDNA technology) is generally not material information within the meaning of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and would not usually be required to be disclosed in the labeling for the food. This determination was reviewed and upheld by the court in Alliance for Bio-Integrity v. Shalala, 116 F. Supp. 2d 166, 178-79 (D.D.C. 2000) (finding that FDA's determination that genetic engineering, alone, is not a material fact that warrants food labeling was entitled to deference) (Ref. 10). Labeling provided by manufacturers on a wholly voluntary basis regarding whether a food was or was not bioengineered as described in this guidance is acceptable to FDA, provided that such labeling is truthful and not misleading. Some consumers are interested in the information provided in such labeling.\n\nThe FD&C Act does not define the term \"material\" within the context of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act. Historically, the agency has interpreted the term, within the context of food, to mean information about the attributes of the food itself. For example, FDA has required special labeling in cases where the absence of such \"material\" information may: (1) pose special health risks (e.g., a warning statement on protein products used in very low calorie diets (21 CFR 101.17(d)) (Ref. 6), or a caution statement not to feed animal food products that contain animal-derived protein to cattle or other ruminants (21 CFR 589.2000(c)(1)(i)) (Ref. 7)); (2) mislead the consumer in light of other statements made on the labeling (e.g., a requirement for quantitative nutrient information when certain nutrient content claims are made about a product (21 CFR 101.13(j)) (Ref. 8)); or (3) in cases where a consumer may assume that a food, because of its similarity to another food, has nutritional, organoleptic (e.g., taste, smell, or texture), or functional characteristics of the food it resembles when in fact it does not (e.g., a statement that reduced fat margarine is not suitable for frying (21 CFR 101.13(d)(1)) (Ref. 9). Further, section 403(i) of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations require that each food bear a common or usual name or, in the absence of such a name, an appropriately descriptive term (21 U.S.C. SS 343(i); 21 CFR 101.3, 501.3). For example, if oil from a genetically engineered canola plant has a significantly different amount of lauric acid such that the fatty acid composition of the oil is significantly changed compared to traditional canola oil, the term \"canola oil\" no longer adequately identifies or describes the nature of the oil or its characterizing properties, particularly Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nsince oils are distinguished by their fatty acid profiles.\n\nSince the commercial introduction of bioengineered crops in the United States in 1996, the use of bioengineered crops has accelerated and such crops are now widely used (Ref. 11). In 2013, in the United States, bioengineered soybeans made up 93 percent of the acreage of planted soybeans, bioengineered cotton made up 90 percent of the acreage of planted cotton, and bioengineered corn varieties made up 90 percent of the acreage planted corn (Ref. 11). In addition, bioengineered sugar beets accounted for 95 percent of the acreage of planted sugar beets in the 2009-2010 crop year (Ref. 11).\n\nIII Guidance\n\nGeneral principles\n\nIn determining whether a food is misbranded, FDA generally reviews labeling statements under sections 403 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and if applicable, other sections of the FD&C Act. Under section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, a food is misbranded if its label or labeling is false or misleading in any particular. For example, the label on a chocolate bar may not declare that the chocolate contains ingredients, such as walnuts and coconut oil, if those ingredients are not actually present in the chocolate.\n\nUnder section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, both the presence and the absence of information are relevant to whether labeling is misleading. Put another way, food labeling may be misleading if it makes or suggests certain representations, or if it fails to disclose facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested about a food or facts that are material with respect to the consequences that may result from use of the food. In determining whether a labeling statement about a food is misleading under sections 201(n) and 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA takes into account all labeling for that food, including the label on the food itself (e.g., all words used on the label including the brand name of the product, vignettes, logos or any of its containers or wrappers and other information accompanying the food, such as labeling for the food that is on the internet. Labeling means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article. 21 U.S.C. 321(m) (section 201(m) of the FD&C Act). Firms should be aware that \"labeling\" may extend to information beyond that included on containers or wrappers. For example, in certain circumstances, information that is disseminated over the internet by, or on behalf of, a regulated company meets the definition of labeling in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act and is subject to applicable requirements. See, e.g., Guidance for Industry and FDA: Dear Manufacturer letter Regarding Food Labeling, January 2007, available at:\n\nhttp://wwwfdagov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Labe\n\nlingNutrition/ucm053425.htm. These general principles apply in evaluating a food labeling claim, including a statement about whether a food is or is not developed using modern plant biotechnology.\n\nB Statements about foods that are not derived from genetically engineered plants\n\nFood manufacturers may voluntarily label their foods with information about whether the foods were not produced using bioengineering, as long as such information is truthful and not misleading. In general, an accurate statement about whether a food was not produced using bioengineering is one that provides information in a context that clearly refers to bioengineering technology. Examples of such statements include:\n\n\"Not bioengineered.\"\n\n\"Not genetically engineered.\"\n\n\"Not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology.\"\n\n\"We do not use ingredients that were produced using modern biotechnology.\"\n\n\"This oil is made from soybeans that were not genetically engineered.\"\n\n\"Our corn growers do not plant bioengineered seeds.\"\n\nOther terms are sometimes used by manufacturers in food labeling regarding whether a food was not derived from genetically engineered plants, including \"not genetically modified\" and claims using the acronym \"GMO\" (genetically modified organism). For the reasons discussed in the remaining paragraphs of this section, FDA recommends terms such as \"not bioengineered,\" \"not genetically engineered,\" and \"not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology.\" However, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym \"GMO\" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was not produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the food is, in fact, not derived from a genetically engineered plant and the food's labeling is not otherwise false or misleading, as further discussed in this guidance. Similarly, we do not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym \"GMO\" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the statement was true and the food's labeling is not otherwise false or misleading.\n\nAs stated, FDA encourages manufacturers to use labeling claims that state that a food product (or its ingredients, as appropriate) was not developed using bioengineering, genetic engineering, or modern biotechnology such as the claims included above.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Plants \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6410625576972961", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 17: For purposes of the dietary supplement labeling requirements, a \u201cdisease\u2019 is damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition\u201d (21 CFR 101.93(g)(1)).\n\n.4.3 Conventional Food\n\nSection 201(f) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines a food as \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" For studies intended to evaluate the effects of a food, the analysis for whether an IND is needed turns on the intent of the clinical investigation.\n\nAs is the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is \"intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,\"18 except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug (see section VI.4.3). Therefore, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a foodon a disease would require an IND under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease would require an IND.\n\nThe following paragraph in brackets [ ] is STAYED.\n\n[The FD&C Act also defines drug to include \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\"19 This provision contains a parenthetical exception for foods that affect the structure and function of the body by virtue of providing nutrition to sustain life and health. Consistent with case law interpreting the other than food, exception as applying to articles consumed primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value, FDA regulates conventional foods (including infant formula) that are intended to affect the structure or function of the body as foods, not drugs, as long as the intended structure or function effect derives from the product's character as a food -- its taste, aroma, or nutritive value.20 However, if an edible product that might otherwise be a conventional food is intended for a use other than providing taste, aroma, or nutritive value, such as blocking the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, the product becomes a drug because the primary purpose of consuming it has changed. In other words, the product is no longer being consumed as a food -- primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value -- but used as a drug for some other physiological effect. Accordingly, a clinical investigation intended only to evaluate the nutritional effects of a food (including medical foods21) would not require an IND, but an investigation intended to evaluate other effects of a food on the structure or function of the body would. For example, a study of the effect of iron on hemoglobin levels in which subjects were fed beef or lambas a source of iron would not require an IND, but a study of the effect of soy isoflav on bone metabolism would. Similarly, a study of the ability of an infant formula to support growth of infants or of other nutritional properties of the formula would not require an IND. However, a study of other effects of the formula on the structure or function of the body (e.g., an investigation of the effects of docosahexaenoic action in infant formula on visual acuity of infants) would require an IND.\n\nFootnote 19: 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C).\n\nFootnote 20: See Nutrilab v. Schweiker, 713 F.2d 335 (7th Cir. 1983).\n\nFootnote 21: A medical food is \u201ca food which is formulated to be consumed or administered generally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.\u201d 21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3).\n\nA clinical study intended to evaluate the safety of a food ingredient generally does not require an IND, even if the ingredient is known to have an effect on the structure and function of the body that is in addition to its taste, aroma, or nutritional effect. For example, a study of the safety of a flavor ingredient that has been found to bind to a receptor outside of the target location in the mouth would not require an IND if the intent of the study was to evaluate the safety of the ingredient when ingested as food. The following sentence in brackets [ ] is STAYED. [In contrast, if the intent of the study was to evaluate the beneficial effects (beyond nutritional effects) of binding the newly found receptor, the study would require an IND.] Similarly, a clinical study may be performed to evaluate the tolerability of a food in a specific susceptible population, including individuals with a disease. In such an evaluation, biological parameters affected by the disease may need to be assessed in order to establish tolerance. For example, the administration of high intensity sweeteners to diabetic patients to establish no adverse effect on HbA1c levels or the administration of a novel food protein ingredient to a potentially allergic population to establish lack of allergic reactivity in this population would not require an IND. However, if the intent of the study was to demonstrate an effect of the food in decreasing HbA1c levels in diabetic patients or an effect of the food to desensitize or raise threshold levels of allergic reactivity in sensitive individuals, the study would require an IND.\n\nConsistent with the considerations for conventional foods described in the previous paragraph, an investigation intended to evaluate the effects of a medical food on a disease would require an IND. However, if the medical food is simply being fed to subjects for nutritional purposes during a study examining the effects of another intervention, the use of the medical food in the study would not trigger the need for an IND, although the study might require an IND or investigational device exemption (IDE) for the intervention being studied.\n\niv.2.3 Studies Intended to Support a Health Claim\n\nNOTE: The stay does not apply to clinical investigations intended to evaluate whether a food substance may reduce the risk of a disease in individuals less than 12 months of age, those with altered immune systems, and those with serious or life-threatening medical conditions. This subsection is in effect for such clinical investigations.\n\nThe following paragraph in brackets [] is STAYED, except as noted above.\n\n[Section 201(g) of the FD&C Act provides that a health claim in the label or labeling of a food (conventional food or dietary supplement) characterizing the relationship between a substance (food or food component) and a disease or health-related condition does not cause the food to be a drug on the basis of that claim, provided the claim is authorized under and made in accordance with the requirements of section 403(r(1)R) and (r(3)S) of the FD&C Act [22] (for conventional foods) or under section 403(r)(1)B and (r(3)D)-(for dietary supplements). Notwithstanding this provision, however, a clinical study designed to evaluate the relationship between a food substance and a disease and intended to provide support for such a claim is required to be conducted under an IND (21 CFR part 312), unless the substance disgate relationship being studied is already the subject of an authorized health claim. Section 403 provides, in effect, an exemption from the normal operation of the drug definition [14] it permits the use of health claims that would, without the exemption caused in conventional food or dietary supplement to be a drug. However the exemption does not apply until the health claim has been authorized by FDA. Therefore a study conducted to support a new or expanded health claim would require an IND. For example, a study designed to evaluate whether vitamin D may reduce the risk of one or more site-specific cancers would require an IND, as there is currently no authorized health claim for this substance-disease relationship. Similarly, a study conducted to support a petition to amend the health claim for soluble fiber from certain foods and reduced risk of coronary heart disease (21 CFR 101.81) to include a new type of fiber would require an IND.]\n\nResearch With Noncommercial Intent\n\nSome believe that the IND regulations do not apply to clinical investigations that are not intended to investigate a drug's potential for commercial sale. Whether the IND regulations apply to a planned clinical investigation does not depend on whether the intent of the clinical investigation is commercial or noncommercial. Therefore, these types of studies would require an IND under part 312, unless they meet the criteria for an exemption in SSSS 312.2(b) or 320.31(b) (see section IV) or the criteria in SS 361.1, or the compound used is labeled with a cold isotope and used in the manner described in section V.\n\nVII Frequently asked questions\n\n1 Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?\n\nIf you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an unlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However, if you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the drug's ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.114050030708313", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Another example of a statement in food labeling that may be false or misleading could be the statement \"None of the ingredients in this food is genetically engineered\" on a food where some of the ingredients are incapable of being produced through genetic engineering (e.g., salt). It may be necessary to carefully qualify the statement where modern biotechnology is not used to produce a particular ingredient or type of food.\n\nFurther, a statement may be false or misleading if, when considered in the context of the entire label or labeling (as noted in Section IIIA. above), it suggests or implies that a food product or ingredient is safer, more nutritious, or otherwise has different attributes than other comparable foods because the food was not genetically engineered. For example, the labeling of a bag of specific type of frozen vegetables that states that they were \"not produced through modern biotechnology\" could be misleading if, in addition to this statement, the labeling contains statements or vignettes that suggest or imply that, as a result of not being produced through modern biotechnology, such vegetables are safer, more nutritious, or have different attributes than other foods solely because the food was not produced using modern biotechnology.\n\nCommon or usual nameSection 403(i)(2) of the FD&C Act requires that, for a food that is made from two or more ingredients, each ingredient must be declared on the food label by its common or usual name. Accordingly, FDA regulations require (among other things) that ingredients required to be declared on the label or labeling of a food must be listed on either the principal display panel or information panel of the food subject to certain exceptions. 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1). Further, FDA regulations provide that ingredients required to be declared on the label or in the labeling of food must be listed by their common or usual name and without intervening material. See 21 CFR 101.2(e), 101.4(a)(1), 501.2(e) and 501.4(a). In general, FDA has interpreted a term used to describe an ingredient in the list required by FDA's regulations (typically in an ingredient statement) that is not part of the ingredient's common or usual name (e.g., \"pure,\" \"fresh,\" \"certified non-GE\") to be intervening material that violates FDAregulations (Ref. [16]). However, elsewhere on the label, other than in the ingredient statement, terms that are not a part of the common or usual name of an ingredient may accompany the name of the ingredient provided it is done in a manner that is truthful and not misleading and otherwise in accordance with the FD&C Act and applicable regulations. For example, the principal display panel on a bottle of soybean oil made from soybeans that were not bioengineered could say \"Made from certified non-GE soybeans,\" provided that (1) the text does not obscure information required to be on the principal display panel, such as the statement of identity; and (2) the ingredient (i.e., soybean oil) is listed in the ingredient list by its common or usual name and without intervening material. This statement could also appear on the information panel of the food product, provided that it does not appear in the ingredient list. In this example, for the ingredient soybean oil, the ingredient list may only list such ingredient as \"soybean oil\" as that term is the common or usual name for the ingredient.\n\n5 Statements about foods that are derived from genetically engineered plants\n\nAs explained in section 3.A above, food labeling may be misleading if, among other things, it makes or suggests certain representations, or if it fails to disclose facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to the consequences that may result from use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual. In general, an accurate statement about whether a food was produced using bioengineering is one that provides information in a context that refers to bioengineering technology. Examples of such statements include:\n\n\"Genetically engineered\" or \"This product contains cornmeal from corn that was produced using modern biotechnology.\"\n\n\"Some of our growers plant soybean seeds that were developed through modern biotechnology to be drought tolerant.\"\n\nThese kinds of simple statements that a food was developed using bioengineering are not likely to be misleading.\n\nMulti-ingredient foodsWhere a benefit from a bioengineered ingredient in a multi-ingredient food is voluntarily described in the labeling for a food, the statement should be worded so that it addresses the ingredient and not the food as a whole; for example, \"This product contains laurate canola from bioengineered canola that may be used as an alternative to palm kernel oil.\" In addition, the amount of the bioengineered ingredient in the food may be relevant to determine whether the statement is misleading. This would apply especially where the bioengineered difference is characterized as a functional improvement. For example, it may be misleading to make a statement about a functionally improved ingredient (e.g., in this example, that the oil may be used as an alternative to palm kernel oil in high temperature cooking applications) in a food that contains only a small amount of the ingredient, if such statement implies that the food'soverall functional quality is significantly improved when the amount of the ingredient present is not sufficient to confer the properties indicated. Research suggests that the presence of a statement on a product label regarding a specific benefit associated with the product can create a more favorable overall perception of a product. (Refs. [17, 18, and 19]).\n\nThe labeling requirements that apply to foods generally, some of which are described above, also apply to food produced using genetic engineering. Foods from some genetically engineered crops, like food from non-genetically engineered crops, may have characteristics that are materially different from those of comparable foods. Such foods would require labeling under existing provisions to disclose such material differences.\n\nBased on sections 403(a)(1), 201(n), and 403(i) of the FD&C Act:\n\nIf a food derived from genetically engineered plants is significantly different from its traditional counterpart such that the common or usual name or existing statement of identity no longer adequately identifies or describes the new food, the name of the new food must be changed to a term that accurately identifies or describes the new food. For example, if oil from a genetically engineered plant has a significantly different amount of lauric acid such that the fatty acid composition of the oil is significantly changed compared to that of conventionally produced oil, the standard name for the oil no longer adequately identifies or describes the nature of the oil or its characterizing properties, particularly since oils are distinguished by their fatty acid profiles. See 21 CFR 102.5, 502.5. Under sections 403(a)(1), 201(n), and 403(i) of the FD&C Act, a word or phrase like \"laurate\" is required to appear as part of the new name to appropriately identify or describe the food. See also 21 CFR 101.3, 501.3.\n\nIf a genetically engineered food or one of its constituents differs from its traditional counterpart regarding how the food is used or the consequences of its use (for example, if the genetically engineered food behaves differently than its traditional counterpart when used in a comparable way, such as in frying or canning), a statement must be made on the label to describe the difference(s) in use or the consequence(s) of its use. Therefore, in this case, under sections 403(a)(1) and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, the fact that such food behaves differently when canned or fried must be disclosed in the labeling for the food.\n\nIf a food derived from genetically engineered plants has a significantly different nutritional property compared to its traditional counterpart, its label must describe such difference. For example, if (hypothetically) a vegetable has been bioengineered to contain vitamin B12, the fact that the vegetable contains vitamin B12 and that non-bioengineered versions of that vegetable do not contain vitamin B12 is material. Thus, in this instance, under sections 403(a)(1) and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, the fact that the vegetable contains vitamin B12 would have to be disclosed in the labeling for the vegetable.\n\nIf a food derived from genetically engineered plants contains an allergen that consumers would not expect to be present in the food based on the name of the food, the presence of that allergen must be disclosed on the label. The presence of such allergen in the food would be material information. Under sections 403(a)(1), 201(n) and potentially, in some circumstances, section 403(w) of the FD&C Act, the labeling for such food is required to disclose the presence of such allergen.\n\n4 Substantiation of labeling statements\n\nA manufacturer that claims that a food product or its ingredients, including foods such as raw agricultural commodities, is bioengineered or is not bioengineered should substantiate that the claim is truthful and not misleading. We note that when selecting a method to substantiate a claim, a manufacturer should consider the specifics of the claim as one method might substantiate one kind of claim, but not another. The following methods may be used to substantiate that a claim, within this context, is truthful and not misleading:\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Plants \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.629000186920166", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement \"Not a significant source of ____\" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when \"circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply\" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, \"FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.\"\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the \"Not a significant source of ____\" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as \"Not a significant source of other nutrients\" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA's labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be \"packaged and sold individually,\" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement \"This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale\" or \"This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale\" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The \"principal display panel\" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The \"information panel\" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), \"Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber\"). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.332420587539673"], "After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27.

Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) \"GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline\" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as \"a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\"17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject's legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is \"a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection.\" We consider an IEC to be \"adequately constituted\" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC's functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered \"adequately constituted\" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as \"a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.\"19 Informed consent is \"documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.\"20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC's written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., \"Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z\"); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., \"Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z\").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA's review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor's/applicant's compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission's cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor's compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (\"List and Description of Investigators\") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 \"Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports\"23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.3137001991271973", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: What if the sponsor changes during the course of the study or within one year of completion of the study, for example, through purchase or merger?\n\nA:: Agency regulations require that an IND/IDE sponsor collect financial information from all clinical investigators and that clinical investigators promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Therefore, if the study spons changes during the course of the study, the clinical investigators will need to update their financial disclosure information relevant to the new sponsor. The new sponsor is responsible for collecting this information, and to ensure that the new sponsor has complete financial disclosure information, the new sponsor should seek this information from the original sponsor, and the agency encourages the original sponsor to share their records with the new sponsor.\n\nWith respect to covered clinical studies conducted outside the United States not pursuant to an IND or IDE (such as studies submitted pursuant to SS 312.120 or SS 814.15), the agency expects applicants to take affirmative action, at the earliest opportunity, to see that this information is collected and available to make a complete disclosure and/or certification under part 54.\n\nAppendix D Clinical Investigator\n\n0.1 Q: Who is included in the definition of \"clinical investigator\"?\n\nUnder part 54, \"clinical investigator means only a listed or identified investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects\" (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). This definition is intended to identify the individuals for whom reporting under this regulation is required. Generally, these individuals are considered to be the investigators and subinvestigators taking responsibility for the study at a given study site. The definition also includes the spouse and each dependent child of such an investigator or subinvestigator. It should be noted that hospital staff, including nurses, residents, fellows, and office staff who provide ancillary or intermittent care but who do not make direct and significant contribution to the data are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator. Additionally, individuals who only collect specimens or perform routine tests (such as blood pressure, EKG, x-ray) are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator for purposes of financial disclosure.\n\n2 Q: How does the definition of \"clinical investigator\" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND regulations (21 CFR part 312)?\n\nFor drugs and biological products, an investigator under 21 CFR part 312 is defined as \"an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. 'Subinvestigator' includes any other individual member of that team.\" (21 CFR SS 312.3(b).) For purposes of the financial disclosure regulation, a clinical investigator is an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). Therefore, the term clinical investigator in this context would generally include anyone who fits any of the following criteria: signs the FORM FDA 1572 (Statement of Investigator), is identified as an investigator in initial submissions or protocol amendments under an IND, or is identified as an investigator in the marketing application. This could include individuals identified as subinvestigatorson a FORM FDA 1572.14 For studies not conducted under an IND, the sponsor will need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455 as appropriate. FDA expects that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site. If other individuals are responsible for a study at a site, those persons should also be included as clinical investigators. Footnote 14: For guidance on who should be listed as an investigator or subinvestigator on Form FDA 1572, please see FDA\u2019s Information Sheet Guidance, \u201cFrequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572)\u201d available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nQ: How does the definition of \"clinical investigator\" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the medical device regulations (21 CFR part 812)?\n\nFor medical devices, investigator is defined under 21 CFR part 812 as an individual under whose immediate direction the subject is treated and the investigational device is administered, including follow-up evaluations and treatments. Where an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. (21 CFR SS 812.3(i).)\n\nIn general, investigators and subinvestigators sign \"investigator agreements\" in accordance with 21 CFR SS 812.43(c), and it is these individuals whose financial interests and arrangements should be reported as they would fall under the definition at 21 CFR SS 54.2(d). For studies not conducted under an FDA-approved IDE (that is, a non-significant risk IDE or an exempt study), the sponsor would need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455, as appropriate. We expect that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site.\n\nQ: Is it necessary to collect financial information on spouses and dependent children of clinical investigators?\n\nYes. The definition of clinical investigator in 21 CFR part 54 includes the spouse and dependent children of the investigators and subinvestigators who are required to report. Therefore, the financial interests and arrangements of the spouse and each dependent child of each investigator and subinvestigator are to be included in the disclosure (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). The dollar amount that triggers reporting is the total of the financial interests of the investigator, spouse, and dependent children (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). If a spouse or dependent child is an employee of the sponsor, the clinical investigator should be identified as an employee of the sponsor and no further disclosure is required. (See 21 CFR SS 54.4.)\n\nQ: Who is considered a \"dependent child\"?\n\nFor purposes of clinical investigator financial disclosure under part 54, a dependent child is the investigator's child (whether by blood or adoption), stepchild or foster child who is unmarried, and for whom the investigator provides more than one-half of the child's support. This would include a child who, at any time during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study, is under the age of 19, under the age of 24 if a full-time student, or who is permanently and totally disabled. Such a child would generally have the same principal residence as the investigator.\n\n*Q: What obligations does the clinical investigator have under the financial disclosure regulations?\n\nClinical investigators are to provide sponsors sufficient accurate financial information to allow the applicant to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Clinical investigators must provide this information to sponsors and also promptly update the information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following the completion of the study (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4(b), 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). See also Question C.2.\n\n*Q: May a clinical investigator rely on the information he/she provided to comply with his/her institution's policies and procedures pertaining to financial conflicts of interest to comply with the investigator obligations for financial disclosure under FDA's regulations?\n\nThe financial information a clinical investigator provides to his/her institution is based on the institution's requirements, which may not be sufficient to meet FDA's regulations. FDA's regulations require the clinical investigator to provide sufficient and accurate financial information to the sponsor to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements under FDA's clinical investigator financial disclosure regulations (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)). However, if an investigator determines that the financial information he/she provided to his/her institution adequately fulfills the disclosure requirements in FDA's regulations, a clinical investigator could provide the same information to the sponsor. The clinical investigator would still need to commit to promptly updating the financial information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)).\n\n*Q: How does the definition of \"sponsor\" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND/IDE regulations (21 CFR parts 312 and 812)?\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.0411220788955688", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n\nFDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice\n\nMarch 2012\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Good Clinical Practice (OGCP) in the Office of the Commissioner (OC) in coordination with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies\n\nNot Conducted Under an IND\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nOn April 28, 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) amended its regulations on the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) (\"non-IND foreign clinical studies\") as support for an IND or a new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a biologics license application (BLA) (collectively known as \"marketing applications\" or \"applications for marketing approval\").2 The final rule requires that such studies be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP), including review and approval by an independent ethics committee (IEC) and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. This final rule, which took effect on October 27, 2008, is codified at 21 CFR 312.120. It is intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.\n\nFootnote 2: 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008).\n\nThis guidance is applicable to all applications submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and\n\nCosmetic Act (FD& C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nThis guidance document is intended to clarify for sponsors and applicants how they can\n\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.3 It provides\n\nrecommendations for the submission of information, whether in an IND or application for\n\nmarketing approval for a drug or biological drug product,4 to demonstrate that a non-IND foreign clinical study was conducted in accordance with GCP.\n\nFootnote 4: For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs, drug products, and drug substances include both human\n\ndrug products and biological drug products regulated by CDER and CBER, unless otherwise specified.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nClinical research is becoming increasingly global, as detailed in reports by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (\"OIG Reports\").5 FDA recognizes that sponsors may choose to conduct multinational clinical studies under a variety of scenarios. Multinational studies may include domestic sites conducted under an IND, foreign sites conducted under an IND, and/or foreign sites not conducted under an IND.6 Sponsors may decide to use the data that is obtained from non-IND foreign sites to support clinical investigations and/or marketing approval(s) in the United States. Some sponsors may even seek to rely solely on foreign clinical data as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the U.S.7 Indeed, the number of INDs and applications for marketing approval supported by foreign clinical trials has increased in recent years and will likely continue to increase in the future.\n\nFootnote 5: See HHS OIG Report, Challenges to FDA\u2019s Ability to Monitor and Inspect Foreign Clinical Trials (June 2010), OEI-01-08-00510, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-08-00510.pdf; HHS OIG Report, The Globalization of Clinical Trials: A Growing Challenge in Protecting Human Subjects (September 2001), OEI-01-00-00190, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-00-00190.pdf.\n\nFootnote 6: For information on how conducting both IND and non-IND studies affects the requirement for investigators to sign the Form FDA 1572, see FDA\u2019s Guidance, Information Sheet Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nThis increasing globalization of clinical trials presents challenges to both U.S. and foreign regulators, many of which are detailed in the OIG reports. Among other challenges, resource constraints limit the number of foreign clinical site inspections that can be conducted. To address these challenges, FDA has sought to leverage its resources more efficiently by: (1) encouraging sponsors to utilize data standardization in their INDs and applications for marketing approval, in order to improve review and analysis of data and facilitate implementation of a site selection model to prioritize sites for inspection; (2) engaging in collaboration and outreach with international regulatory authorities; and (3) considering alternative mechanisms of clinical trial oversight both by sponsors and FDA, such as a quality management system approach which emphasizes building quality into the research process.\n\nThis guidance document is part of FDA's overall efforts to strengthen oversight of foreign clinical trials.8 Specifically, FDA is issuing this guidance as part of its efforts to encourage sponsors and applicants to standardize information relating to foreign clinical trials in their INDs and applications for marketing approval (see (1), above). This guidance should help sponsorsand applicants submit information in a consistent and standardized manner to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nMuch of the information in this guidance comes from the preamble to the final rule, 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008). It is organized in a question and answer format that tracks the regulatory provisions. In addition to addressing the substantive requirements of the final rule, this guidance addresses organization and submission procedures. Specifically, as described in Section III.B, when sponsors or applicants submit information about a non-IND foreign clinical study, they should clearly identify in the cover letter (a) that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120, and (b) where in the submission the information required by 21 CFR 312.120(b) can be located.\n\nAlthough FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7257086634635925", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA receives frequent inquiries from the academic community (e.g., clinical investigators, IRBs) and the pharmaceutical industry about whether an IND should be submitted for various types of clinical research. Inquiries have related to a range of issues concerning application of the IND requirements in part 312, including, for example:\n\nClinical investigations using marketed drugs\n\nBioequivalence/bioavailability studies\n\nStudies using radiolabeled or cold isotopes\n\nStudies using dietary supplements or foods\n\nStudies using endogenous compounds\n\nPathogenesis studies using modified organisms\n\nStudies using wild-type organisms in challenge models\n\nStudies that do not have a commercial purpose\n\nBecause of the large number of inquiries and wide range of issues, FDA determined that it would be helpful to provide to potential sponsors, clinical investigators, and sponsor-investigators an overview of the IND requirements and related issues.\n\nWith certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which a drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312. Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this guidance elaborate on the criteria for when a study must be conducted under an IND; the types of studies that involve drugs, but that are exempt from the IND requirements; studies involving radioactive drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective (and to which IND requirements therefore do not apply); and FDA's use of enforcement discretion with respect to certain studies using cold isotopes conducted without an IND. Section 6 discusses specific issues that frequently arise concerning application of the IND regulations; section 7 contains frequently asked questions; and section 8 describes the process for seeking advice from FDA concerning the application of the IND regulations to a planned clinical investigation.\n\n3 Research studies that require an IND\n\nIn general, the IND regulations in part 312 require that human research studies be conducted under an IND if all of the following conditions exist:* The research involves a drug as that term is defined in section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).\n* The research is a clinical investigation as defined in the IND regulations (21 CFR 312.3).\n* The clinical investigation is not otherwise exempt from the IND requirements in part 312 (see section IV of this guidance).\n\n1 What Is a Drug?\n\nThe definition of the term drug in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act includes, among other things, \"articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease...\" and \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\" Biological products subject to licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) may also be considered drugs within the meaning of the FD&C Act. A biological product is:\n\n... a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or argphenamine or derivative of argphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.\n\nBiological products include, among other products, bacterial vaccines, allergenic extracts, gene therapy products, growth factors, cytokines, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\nIt is important to note that the drug definition is not limited to compounds intended for a therapeutic purpose.4 The definition also includes compounds intended to affect the structure or function of the body, without regard to whether the compound is intended to influence a disease process. For example, the definition includes compounds administered to healthy individuals to prevent pregnancy or treat male pattern baldness. The definition also includes compounds used for research purposes in healthy subjects to blunt or provoke a physiologic response or study the mechanism of action or metabolism of a drug (see section VI.A). Note, however, that (1) a dietary supplement intended only to affect the structure or function of the body and not intended for a therapeutic purpose is not a drug5 (see section VI.D.1) and (2) a food used as such (i.e., primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value) and not for a therapeutic purpose or to affect the structure or function of the body, other than by providing nutrition, is not a drug (see section VI.D.2).6\n\nWhat Is a Clinical Investigation?\n\nThe IND regulations in SS 312.3(b) define clinical investigation7 as:\n\nFootnote 7: Additional information on clinical investigations is available on FDA\u2019s Web site at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\n... [an] experiment in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, one or more human subjects. For the purposes of [the IND regulations], an experiment is any use of a drug [whether approved or unapproved] except for the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice.\n\nFor example, a randomized trial evaluating an unapproved use of a lawfully marketed drug is a clinical investigation and may require an IND.8 In contrast, use of a lawfully marketed drug for an unapproved use in the course of medical practice is not a clinical investigation and does not require an IND because it involves the use in an individual patient where the primary intent is to treat the patient.\n\nFootnote 8: See section IV.A of this guidance.\n\nIV Clinical Investigations that are Exempt from the IND requirements by Regulation\n\nFDA regulations describe two categories of clinical investigations that are exempt from the IND requirements in part 312, provided the criteria for exemption are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 320.31(b)). The two categories of clinical investigations and the applicable criteria are described in the following subsections. Ordinarily, clinical investigations of drugs that do not meet these criteria must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312.\n\nCertain Research Involving Marketed Drug Products\n\nWhether an IND is needed to conduct a clinical investigation of a marketed drug primarily depends on the intent of the investigation and the degree of risk associated with the use of the drug in the investigation. A clinical investigation of a marketed drug is exempt from the IND requirements if all of the criteria for an exemption in SS 312.2(b) are met:\n\nThe drug product is lawfully marketed in the United States.\n\nThe investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug.\n\nIn the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the drug.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by an IRB (21 CFR part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of SS 312.7 (i.e., the investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).\n\nThe potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator of a planned clinical investigation using a marketed drug is responsible for determining whether the investigation meets the criteria for an exemption.9 If there is uncertainty about whether the exemption criteria are met, the potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator can seek advice from FDA on the applicability of the IND regulations (SS 312.2(e)).\n\nFootnote 9: The preamble to the rule finalizing the IND regulations provides: FDA recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment must be exercised in determining whether the conditions of an investigation \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the risk associated with use of the drug. Because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption. (See the final rule on New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations that published in the Federal Register of March 19, 1987 (52 FR 8798 at 8802)).\n\nThree of the criteria for exemption listed previously merit further discussion.\n\nWhat is meant by a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the United States?\n\nThe preamble to the final rule incorporating the IND exemption criteria into the IND regulations makes clear that the exemption provision was not intended to require use of only the marketed version of the drug product for a clinical investigation to be exempt from the IND requirements. The intent was to provide some latitude to modify the marketed version of the drug product for use in a clinical investigation. In responding to comments asking FDA to clarify to what extent a sponsor could change the marketed drug product or conditions of use and still be exempt from the IND regulations, FDA stated that: The exemption was not intended to require an investigator to use the drug in exactly the same dosage form, dosage levels, and patient populations described in the marketed labeling for the product, but rather to permit changes to the lawfully marketed drug product that do not increase the risks...over the risk presented by use of the product in conformance with its marketed labeling.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final rule, \u201cNew Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations\u201d (52 FR 8798 at 8801, March 19, 1987).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.20399847626686096", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: INDs\n\nWho can sponsor an IND? INDs can be sponsored by an individual (e.g., a physician), an institution, or a company.\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs_.\n\nWill drugs for which there is a United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) monograph be exempt from submitting an IND? No. The fact that a drug has a USP monograph does not eliminate the need for an IND, although the drug might be eligible for an expanded access IND if the criteria are met (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs).\n\nWhat is the definition of clinical use in the context of PET drugs?Clinical use refers to administration of the drug to patients as a component of their clinical care with no intent to study the safety or effectiveness of the drug in any systematic way.\nQ20: Can research be conducted under an IND for FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18, or Rubidium Chloride Rb82?\n\nYes. Research and/or investigational studies using these drugs should be conducted under an IND if they are being studied for purposes of commercial clinical use (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs). Human research using a PET drug may be conducted under the RDRC if it is basic science research and not research that is intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes, or research to determine the safety and effectiveness of the radioactive drug or biological product for such purposes (see the guidance The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application).\nQ21: In submitting the physician-sponsored IND, one of the biggest hurdles is trying to get the necessary preclinical pharmacological and toxicology data to support the submission. Would FDA consider reducing the requirement?\n\nIf you have adequate evidence of the PET drug's safe clinical use, you may submit that clinical information to FDA for review and we will determine whether the drug is safe for use within the proposed IND clinical study or studies. The existing clinical information may limit or negate the need for preclinical data. Clinical information from the use of the PET drug's non-radiolabeled ligand may also prove sufficient to limit or negate the need for preclinical data.\n\nFor PET drugs that have not been in clinical use, the extent of necessary preclinical data depends on whether the PET drug ligand is a naturally occurring endogenous substance in humans or not. In general, limited or no preclinical data are necessary to support the use of a PET drug that consists of a ligand that is naturally occurring within humans, if the only major ex vivo modification is the radiolabeling of the ligand. The extent of preclinical data necessary to support a clinical study or studies under an exploratory IND is more limited than the preclinical data necessary for a traditional IND (see the guidance Exploratory IND Studies).\nQ22: Many trials for therapeutic drugs are currently being conducted abroad. If a PET drug is used to determine eligibility for the clinical trial abroad, what would FDA need to know about the PET drug when approval is sought under an NDA for the therapeutic drug?Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe answer to this question depends on several factors. If the use of the PET drug to determine eligibility is an approved indication in the United States, we would need CMC data to show that the PET drug used in the trial is comparable to the drug that is approved for use in the United States. For example, if a PET drug were to be approved in the United States to identify early Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, the foreign trial's PET drug would need to be bioequivalent to the approved drug in the United States.\n\nIf the use of the PET drug to determine eligibility is not an approved indication in the United States (e.g., no PET drugs are currently approved to determine whether a patient has early Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease), the safety and efficacy of the PET drug for that use would have to be established and the data submitted within an NDA.\nQ23: If a PET drug producer creates a centralized IND (e.g., an IND for multicenter participation and protocol compliance, image acquisition standardization, image output harmonization) to use FDG in biomarker trials and that producer has an ANDA, can the applicant cross-reference the CMC data in the ANDA or must the applicant submit the CMC documentation with the IND?\n\nCross-referencing to the approved ANDA is acceptable provided that the drug used in the biomarker trials is the drug produced under the ANDA.\nQ24: What is FDA's current position regarding the continued use of PET drugs (Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection, Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection, and Ammonia N13 Injection) in ongoing clinical trials for new uses of these products or to support clinical trials of therapeutic drugs?\n\nFDA's position is as follows:\n\nIf the PET drug used in the clinical trial is being made at a facility for which manufacturing data have been submitted in an NDA or ANDA for the PET drug, then FDA does not intend to object to use of the PET drug without an IND until December 12, 2015, if this and the other requirements in 21 CFR 312.2 are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b)).\n\nHowever, if significant manufacturing deficiencies are found during the NDA or ANDA review, or during inspection of the facility the PET drug is sourced from, FDA may notify the sponsor that the PET drug should no longer be used in clinical trials.\n\nAfter December 12, 2015, investigational use of a PET drug must be covered by an IND unless it is exempt from all of the IND requirements.\n\nFor a PET drug that has not been approved, what documentation must be provided to support an IND that is already in effect for a therapeutic drug that relies on the PET drug to monitor disease progression or otherwise evaluate the efficacy of the therapeutic drug? Before December 12, 2015, no CMC documentation for the PET drug needs to be submitted to the IND for the therapeutic drug as long as the PET drug is manufactured at a facility for which supportive manufacturing information has been submitted in an NDA or ANDA. After December 12, 2015, for PET drugs manufactured at facilities that are not named in an approved NDA or ANDA, CMC documentation for the PET drug will need to be submitted to the IND for the therapeutic drug.\n\nHow will an investigator know whether an NDA or ANDA has been submitted and what records should be submitted to document that the PET drug was sourced from a facility named in an NDA or ANDA? Documentation should be maintained at the trial site where the investigation is being conducted that indicates the number of the NDA or ANDA that contains the CMC data for the facility from which the drug is sourced. Over the next several months, clinical investigators should make sure this documentation is in place for the PET drugs used in their investigations.\n\nIf an approved PET drug is used to determine eligibility for patient entry into an investigational therapeutic trial, will we have to submit an IND for the PET drug and an IND for the therapeutic drug? No. If the PET drug's use in the investigational trial is not for an approved indication, the sponsor could describe the investigational use of the PET drug in the original IND for the therapeutic drug trial. Two INDs would not be necessary in this situation. The therapeutic drug IND would need to either provide documentation that the PET drug is sourced from a facility with an approved NDA or ANDA, or provide sufficient CMC data to support its use in the trial. 3. ANDAs\n\nDo I need to use the same manufacturing process as the reference listed drug (RLD)? No. Within the context of ANDAs, FDA regulations define a drug that is \"the same as\" a listed drug to mean a generic drug that has the \"identical...active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use\" as its RLD (See 21 CFR314.92(a)(1)). Differences in the manufacturing processes do not affect whether a product may be submitted and approved under an ANDA.\nQ29: Will we need to contact the NDA holder to obtain a sample of the RLD for the comparison testing?\n\nObtaining the RLD for comparison testing is not necessary. FDA recognizes that for PET products, it may not be possible to do a direct comparison with an RLD product because of the short shelf life of these products.\nQ30: A recently approved ANDA for FDG has different inactive ingredients than its RLD, although the drug was found to be bioequivalent. Will this ANDA be considered an RLD?\n\nNo, the ANDA would not be identified as an RLD in the Orange Book.\nQ31: If an ANDA applicant is referencing an NDA, does the applicant have to perform all of the quality control testing listed in that approved NDA? For example, if the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and osmolality testing are listed in the RLD NDA, does the ANDA applicant have to include that testing?\n\nNo. Each application is reviewed on its own merits. The application must establish the necessary quality standards, tests, and specifications, and demonstrate that the quality standards will be met over the life of the product.\nQ32: How would an ANDA applicant be able to demonstrate sameness to the RLD if the composition per batch is not known by the applicant?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.12579041719436646"], "Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: Significant body of information not available: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report. b. Dissolution documentation Extended release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, a multipoint dissolution profile should be obtained using the application/compential test conditions for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter, until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. Delayed release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, a multipoint dissolution profile should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing using the application/compential test conditions for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. c. Bioequivalence documentation A single-dose bioequivalence study [(3)]. The bioequivalence study may be waived in the presence of an established in vitro/in vivo correlation [(6)].\n3. Filing Documentation Prior approval supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\n4 Components and Composition -- Release Controlling Excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in release controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the excipient is critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications (i.e., mechanism of drug release and manufacturing process) for claiming any excipient(s) as a release controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes exceeding the ranges defined in each of the levels below may be allowed if considered to be within normal batch-to-batch variation and contained within an approved original application. In such situations, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division for further guidance.\n\nA. Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExample:\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation less than or equal to 5% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients in the original approved formulation.4 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the approved original application range.\n\nFootnote 4: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, ethylcellulose and a plasticizer, the ethylcellulose and plasticizer content should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients (e.g., ethylcellulose content increases by 2.5% and plasticizer content increases by 2.5%) relative to the original approved total release controlling excipient content weight in the modified release solid oral dosage form if it is to stay within the given range allowed for level 1.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na. Chemistry documentation\n\nApplication/compendial product release requirements.\n\nStability: First production batch on long-term stability data reported in annual report.\n\nb. Dissolution documentation\n\nNone beyond application/compendial requirements.\n\nc. Bioequivalence documentation\n\nNone.\n\nFiling Documentation\n\nAnnual report (all information including long-term stability data).\n\nB. Level 2 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 2 changes are those that could have a significant impact on formulation quality and performance. Test documentation for a level 2 change would vary depending on whether the product could be considered to have a narrow therapeutic range.5\n\nFootnote 5: At present, there is no official CDER list of narrow therapeutic range drugs. A list was developed earlier in a preliminary attempt to identify drugs where there was greater concern that deviation from the specifications and potential changes in bioavailability could raise clinical issues. This preliminary list was not based solely on 21 CFR 320.33(c) which is contained in a section of the regulations related to criteria and evidence to assess actual or potential bioequivalence problems, nor does it accurately reflect the Agency\u2019s opinion on narrow therapeutic range drugs. Currently, the issue of narrow therapeutic range drugs is under discussion within CDER. If unsure about the classification of a drug as a narrow therapeutic range drug, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division.\n\nExamples:\n\nChange in the technical grade and/or specifications of the release controlling excipient(s).6 Footnote 6: Example: Eudragit RS-100 vs. Eudragit RL-100.\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation, greater than those listed above for a level 1 change, but less than or equal to 10% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the drug product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 10% w/w of the total release controlling excipient(s) in the original approved formulation. The total weight of the dosage form could still be within or outside the approved original application range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition are based on the original approved target composition and not on the composition based on previous level 1 or level 2 changes. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n* Test Documentation\n* Chemistry documentation Application/compential product release requirements and updated executed batch records.\n\nStability:\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs: One batch with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first production batch reported in annual report.\n\nNarrow therapeutic range drugs: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report.\n\nDissolution documentation\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs\n\nExtended release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained in three other media, for example, in water, 0.1N HCl, and USP buffer media at pH 4.5, and 6.8 for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, dissolution tests should be performed in 0.1 N HCl for 2 hours (acid stage) followed by testing in USP buffer media in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 (buffer stage) under standard (application/compendial) test conditions and two additional agitation speeds using the application/compendial test apparatus (three additional test conditions). If the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. The above dissolution testing should be performed using the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product).\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-MR- Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9588835835456848", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: Stress testing\n\nPhotostability testing, which is an integral part of stress testing, should be conducted on at least one primary batch of the FPP if appropriate. More details can be found in other guidelines [2].\n\nAdditional stress testing of specific types of dosage forms may be appropriate, e.g. cyclic studies for semi-solid products or freeze-thaw studies for liquid products.\n\nSelection of batches\n\nThe requirements that follow are not generally intended to apply to variations, which are covered in section 2.2.12 Variations.\n\nFor FPPs containing new APIs, data from stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of each proposed strength of the FPP. Two of the three batches should be at least pilot-scale batches and the third batch can be smaller, if justified (see example below).\n\nFor FPPs containing existing APIs (e.g. generics), data should be provided on not less than two batches of at least pilot scale, or in the case of an uncomplicated3 FPP (e.g. immediate-release solid FPPs (with noted exceptions) or non-sterile solutions), at least one batch of at least pilot scale and a second batch which may be smaller (e.g. for solid oral dosage forms, 25 000 or 50 000 tablets or capsules) of each proposed strength of the FPP.\n\nFootnote 3: The term \u201ccomplicated FPP\u201d includes sterile products, metered dose inhaler products, dry powder inhaler products and transdermal delivery systems. Solid oral products considered \u201ccomplicated\u201dinclude modified-release FPPs, products containing problematical APIs such as ritonavir and FDCs containing APIs such as rifampicin or an artemisinin.\n\nThe primary batches should be of the same formulation and packaged in the same container-closure system as that proposed for marketing. The manufacturing process used for primary batches should simulate that to be applied to production batches and should provide product of the same quality and meeting the same specification as that intended for marketing.\n\nWhen a batch size smaller than pilot scale is used as a primary batch, data or a discussion is required to confirm that the smaller batch is representative of the intended production size, including its formulation and method of manufacture.\n\nWhere possible, batches of the FPP should be manufactured using different batches of the API(s).\n\nStability studies should be performed on each individual strength, dosage form and container type and size of the FPP unless bracketing or matrixing is applied (refer to ICH Q1D).\n\n224 Container-closure system\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.009710211306810379", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.1.3 Selection of Batches (2.1.3)\n\nData from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the drug substance. The batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route as production batches and using a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on formal stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nii.1.4 Container Closure System (2.1.4)\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the drug substance packaged in a container closure system that is the same as or simulates the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\nii.1.5 Specification (2.1.5)\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, is addressed in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances and Q6B__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Biotechnological/Biological Products. In addition, specification for degradation products in a drug substance is discussed in ICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances.\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed should depend on the results from validation studies.\n\nTesting Frequency (2.1.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug substance. For drug substances with a proposed retest period of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed retest period.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that the results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nStorage Conditions (2.1.7)\n\nIn general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug substances are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug substance is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) or (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}).\n\n** If (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) and significant change occurs at any time during 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. Testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all tests, unless otherwise justified. The initial application should include a minimum of 6 months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\nSignificant change for a drug substance is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\nData from refrigerated storage should be assessed according to the evaluation section of this guidance, except where explicitly noted below.\n\nIf significant change occurs between 3 and 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the real time data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\nIf significant change occurs within the first 3 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling). This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the drug substance for a period shorter than 3 months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test a drug substance through 6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.\n\nFor drug substances intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period should be based on the real time data obtained at the long-term storage condition. In the absence of an accelerated storage condition for drug substances intended to be stored in a freezer, testing on a single batch at an elevated temperature (e.g., (5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) or (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})) for an appropriate time period should be conducted to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling).\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) (2.1.7.4)\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) should be treated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8 Stability Commitment (2.1.8)\n\nWhen available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed retest period granted at the time of approval, a commitment should be made to continue the stability studies postapproval to firmly establish the retest period.\n\nWhere the submission includes long-term stability data on three production batches covering the proposed retest period, a postapproval commitment is considered unnecessary. Otherwise, one of the following commitments should be made:\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period and to place additional production batches, to a total of at least three, on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission does not include stability data on production batches, a commitment should be made to place the first three production batches on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nThe stability protocol used for long-term studies for the stability commitment should be the same as that for the primary batches, unless otherwise scientifically justified.\n\n9.1.9 Evaluation (2.1.9)\n\nThe purpose of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance and evaluating the stability information (including, as appropriate, results of the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the drug substance manufactured under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification throughout the assigned retest period.\n\nThe data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under these circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis; providing a justification for the omission should be sufficient.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7473126649856567", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.2.6 Testing Frequency (2.2.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug product. For products with a proposed shelf life of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed shelf life.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that results from accelerated testing are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or by including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\n3.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nReduced designs (i.e., matrixing or bracketing), where the testing frequency is reduced or certain factor combinations are not tested at all, can be applied if justified.\n\n3.2.3 Storage Conditions (2.2.7)\n\nIn general, a drug product should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture or potential for solvent loss. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nStability testing of the drug product after constitution or dilution, if applicable, should be conducted to provide information for the labeling on the preparation, storage condition, and in-use period of the constituted or diluted product. This testing should be performed on the constituted or diluted product through the proposed in-use period on primary batches as part of the formal stability studies at initial and final time points, and if full shelf life, long-term data will not be available before submission, at 12 months or the last time point for which data will be available. In general, this testing need not be repeated on commitment batches.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed shelf life. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug products are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug product is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \\hline \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Study} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Storage condition} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Minimum time period covered} \\  & & by data at submission \\ \\hline Long-term & (25^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/60\\% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH & 12 months \\  & or & \\  & (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/65\\% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH & \\ \\hline Intermediate* & (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/65\\% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH & 6 months \\ \\hline Accelerated & (40^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/75\\% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH & 6 months \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/60% RH (\\pm) 5% RH or (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/65% RH (\\pm) 5% RH.\n\n** If (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/65% RH (\\pm) 5% RH is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIn general, significant change for a drug product is defined as one or more of the following (as appropriate for the dosage form):\n\nA 5 percent change in assay from its initial value, or failure to meet the acceptance criteria for potency when using biological or immunological procedures\n\nAny degradation product's exceeding its acceptance criterion\n\nFailure to meet the acceptance criteria for appearance, physical attributes, and functionality test (e.g., color, phase separation, resuspendibility, caking, hardness, dose delivery per actuation). However, some changes in physical attributes (e.g., softening of suppositories, melting of creams) may be expected under accelerated conditions.\n\nFailure to meet the acceptance criterion for pH\n\nFailure to meet the acceptance criteria for dissolution for 12 dosage units\n\nDrug products packaged in impermeable containers (2.2.7.2)\n\nSensitivity to moisture or potential for solvent loss is not a concern for drug products packaged in impermeable containers that provide a permanent barrier to passage of moisture or solvent.\n\nThus, stability studies for products stored in impermeable containers can be conducted under any controlled or ambient humidity condition.\n\nC. Drug products packaged in semipermeable containers (2.2.7.3)\n\nAqueous-based products packaged in semipermeable containers should be evaluated for potential water loss in addition to physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological stability. This evaluation can be carried out under conditions of low relative humidity, as discussed below.\n\nUltimately, it should be demonstrated that aqueous-based drug products stored in semipermeable containers can withstand low relative humidity environments. Other comparable approaches can be developed and reported for nonaqueous, solvent-based products.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \\hline\nStudy & Storage condition & Minimum time period covered by data at submission \\ \\hline Long-term * & (25^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/40\\% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH or & 12 months \\  & (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/35\\% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH & \\ \\hline Intermediate** & (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/65\\% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH & 6 months \\ \\hline Accelerated & (40^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/not more than (NMT) 25\\% RH & 6 months \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/40% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH or (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/35% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH.\n\n** If (30^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/35% RH (\\pm) 5\\% RH is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nWhen long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/40% RH (\\pm) 5(\\%) RH and significant change other than water loss occurs during the 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be performed, as described under the general case, to evaluate the temperature effect at (30^{\\circ})C. A significant change in water loss alone at the accelerated storage condition does not necessitate testing at the intermediate storage condition. However, data should be provided to demonstrate that the drug product will not have significant water loss throughout the proposed shelf life if stored at (25^{\\circ})C and the reference relative humidity of 40 percent RH.\n\nA 5 percent loss in water from its initial value is considered a significant change for a product packaged in a semipermeable container after an equivalent of 3 months' storage at (40^{\\circ})C/NMT 25 percent RH. However, for small containers (1 mL or less) or unit-dose products, a water loss of 5 percent or more after an equivalent of 3 months' storage at (40^{\\circ})C/NMT 25 percent RH may be appropriate if justified.\n\nAn alternative approach to studying at the reference relative humidity as recommended in the table above (for either long-term or accelerated testing) is performing the stability studies under higher relative humidity and deriving the water loss at the reference relative humidity through calculation. This can be achieved by experimentally determining the permeation coefficient for the container closure system or, as shown in the example below, using the calculated ratio of water loss rates between the two humidity conditions at the same temperature. The permeation coefficient for a container closure system can be experimentally determined by using the worst case scenario (e.g., the most diluted of a series of concentrations) for the proposed drug product.\n\nExample of an approach for determining water loss:\n\nFor a product in a given container closure system, container size, and fill, an appropriate approach for deriving the water loss rate at the reference relative humidity is to multiply the water loss rate measured at an alternative relative humidity at the same temperature by a water loss rate ratio shown in the table below. A linear water loss rate at the alternative relative humidity over the storage period should be demonstrated.\n\nFor example, at a given temperature (e.g., 40({}^{\\circ})C), the calculated water loss rate during storage at NMT 25 percent RH is the water loss rate measured at 75 percent RH multiplied by 3.0, the corresponding water loss rate ratio.\n\nValid water loss rate ratios at relative humidity conditions other than those shown in the table above can also be used.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline\nStudy & Storage condition & Minimum time period covered by data \\  & & at submission \\ \\hline Long-term & 5({}^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 3({}^{\\circ})C & 12 months \\ \\hline Accelerated & 25({}^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2({}^{\\circ})C/60\\% RH & 6 months \\  & (\\pm) 5\\% RH & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8998302221298218", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: The nature of any degradation relationship will determine whether the data should be transformed for linear regression analysis. Usually the relationship can be represented by a linear, quadratic, or cubic function on an arithmetic or logarithmic scale. Statistical methods should be employed to test the goodness of fit of the data on all batches and combined batches (where appropriate) to the assumed degradation line or curve.\n\nLimited extrapolation of the real-time data from the long-term storage condition beyond the observed range to extend the re-test period can be undertaken at approval time, if justified. This justification should be based, for example, on what is known about the mechanism of degradation, the results of testing under accelerated conditions, the goodness of fit of any mathematical model, batch size, existence of supporting stability data, etc. However, this extrapolation assumes that the same degradation relationship will continue to apply beyond the observed data.\n\nAny evaluation should cover not only the assay, but also the levels of degradation products and other appropriate attributes.\n\n2.1.3 Statements/Labeling\n\nA storage statement should be established for the labeling in accordance with relevant national/regional requirements. The statement should be based on the stability evaluation of the drug substance. Where applicable, specific instructions should be provided, particularly for drug substances that cannot tolerate freezing. Terms such as \"ambient conditions\" or \"room temperature\" should be avoided.\n\n2.2.1 General\n\nThe design of the formal stability studies for the medicinal product should be based on knowledge of the behavior and properties of the drug substance and from stability studies on the drug substance and on experience gained from clinical formulation studies. The likely changes on storage and the rationale for the selection of attributes to be tested in the formal stability studies should be stated.\n\n2.2.2 Photostability Testing\n\nPhotostability testing should be conducted on at least one primary batch of the medicinal product, if appropriate. The standard conditions for photostability testing are described in VICH GL5.\n\n2.2.3 Selection of Batches\n\nData from stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the medicinal product. The primary batches should be of the same formulation and packaged in the same container closure system as proposed for marketing. The manufacturing process used for primary batches should simulate that to be applied to production batches and should provide product of the same quality and meeting the same specification as that intended for marketing. Two of the three batches should be at least pilot scale batches, and the third one can be smaller, if justified. Where possible, batches of the medicinal product should be manufactured by using different batches of the drug substance.\n\nStability studies should be performed on each individual strength and container size of the medicinal product unless bracketing or matrixing is applied.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\n2.2.4 Container Closure System\n\nStability testing should be conducted on the dosage form packaged in the container closure system proposed for marketing (including, as appropriate, any secondary packaging and container label). In some cases, a smaller container closure system simulating the actual container closure system for marketing may be acceptable. In these instances, a justification for using a smaller container closure system should be provided. Any available studies carried out on the medicinal product outside its immediate container or in other packaging materials may form a useful part of the stress testing of the dosage form or may be considered as supporting information, respectively.\n\n2.2.5 Specification\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, including the concept of different acceptance criteria for release and shelf life specifications, is addressed in VICH GL39 and GL40. In addition, specification for degradation products in a medicinal product is addressed in GL11(R).\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the medicinal product that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes, preservative content (e.g., antioxidant, antimicrobial preservative), and functionality tests (e.g., for a dose delivery system). Analytical procedures should be fully validated and stability indicating. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed will depend on the results of validation studies.\n\nShelf life acceptance criteria should be derived from consideration of all available stability information. It may be appropriate to have justifiable differences between the shelf life and release acceptance criteria based on the stability evaluation and the changes observed on storage. Any differences between the release and shelf life acceptance criteria for antimicrobial preservative content should be supported by data demonstrating preservative effectiveness of a development batch of the proposed formulation artificially prepared to contain the lowest permitted levels of the antimicrobial preservative(s) according to the shelf-life specification. A single primary stability batch of the medicinal product should be tested for antimicrobial preservative effectiveness (in addition to preservative content) at the proposed shelf life for verification purposes, regardless of whether there is a difference between the release and shelf life acceptance criteria for preservative content.\n\n2.2.6 Testing Frequency\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the medicinal product. For products with a proposed shelf life of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed shelf life.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that results from accelerated testing are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or by including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nReduced designs, i.e., matrixing or bracketing, where the testing frequency is reduced or certain factor combinations are not tested at all, may be applied, if justified.\n\nStorage Conditions\n\nIn general, a medicinal product should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture or potential for solvent loss. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nStability testing of the medicinal product after constitution or dilution, if applicable, should be conducted to provide information for the labeling on the preparation, storage condition, and in-use period of the constituted or diluted product. This testing should be performed on the constituted or diluted product through the proposed in-use period on primary batches as part of the formal stability studies at initial and final time points and, if full shelf life long-term data will not be available before submission, at 12 months or the last time point for which data will be available. In general, repeating this testing on commitment batches is not recommended.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 6 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed shelf life. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities, if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition may be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for medicinal products are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the medicinal product is not specifically covered by a subsequent section.

In addition, long-term stability should be studied.\n\nFor chemical drugs, the stability at one temperature (e.g., -20({}^{\\circ})C) can be extrapolated to lower temperatures (e.g., -70/-80({}^{\\circ})C).\n\nFor biological drugs, a bracketing approach can be applied, e.g., in the case that the stability has been demonstrated at -70/-80({}^{\\circ})C and at -20({}^{\\circ})C, then it is not necessary to investigate the stability at temperatures in between those two points at which study samples will be stored.\n\n4.3 Study Sample Analysis\n\nThe analysis of study samples can be carried out after validation has been completed, however, it is understood that some parameters may be completed at a later stage (e.g., long-term stability). By the time the data are submitted to a regulatory authority, the bioanalytical method validation should have been completed. The study samples, QCs and calibration standards should be processed in accordance with the validated analytical method. Refer to Table 1 for expectations regarding documentation.\n\nAnalytical Run\n\nAn analytical run consists of a blank sample, calibration standards at a minimum of 6 concentration levels, at least 3 levels of QCs (low, medium and high) applied as two sets (or at least 5% of the number of study samples, whichever is higher) and the study samples to be analysed. The blank sample should not be included in the calculation of calibration curve parameters.

For example, if the directions on your label say to take 1-3 tablets with breakfast, the serving size would be 3 tablets.\n\n21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2 in the Miscellaneous Category\n\n5 May I use flexibility in the wording for \"Serving Size?\"\n\nNo. You must use the term \"Serving Size.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)\n\nNutrient Declaration\n\nWhat nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nTotal calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron must be listed when they are present in measurable amounts. A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as \"zero\" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for \"% Daily Value\" that refers to the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, not in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel. Ingredients in dietary supplements that are not dietary ingredients, such as binders, excipients, fillers, must be included in the ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nMust I declare vitamin E when it occurs naturally in my product and I make no claim for it?\n\nNo. Because Vitamin E is not one of the 14 mandatory dietary ingredients, it does not need to be declared when it occurs naturally.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMay I declare protein on the label if my product contains only individual amino acids?\n\nNo. You may not declare protein on your products that contain only amino acids.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMust I list the dietary ingredients in my products in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list \"folic acid\" or \"folacin\" without parentheses in place of \"folate.\" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.436607837677002", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and \"other carbohydrate\" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the \"Nutrition Facts\" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \"Nutrition Facts\" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for \"Calories,\" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for \"Calories\" and the numeric value of \"Calories.\" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" declaration now immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" is the declaration of \"Serving size.\" \"Serving size\" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the \"Serving size\" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the \"Serving size\" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry\" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics\" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile \"Calories from fat\" can no longer be declared, \"Calories from saturated fat\" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare \"Added Sugars\" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for \"Total Sugars\" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The 'X' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that \"added sugars\" are a subcomponent of \"total sugars.\" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement \"Contains less than 1 gram\" or, alternatively, \"less than 1 gram\" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.0188891887664795", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: 21 CFR 101.13(h)(4)(iii)\n* 14._When may I make a \"high\" or \"good source\" claim? You may make a \"high\" claim when your dietary supplement contains at least 20% of the Daily Value (DV) (i.e. the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV)) of the nutrient that is the subject of the claim per reference amount customarily consumed. You may make a \"good source\" claim when your dietary supplement contains 10 to 19% of DV. 21 CFR 101.54(b)(i) and (c)(i)\n* 15._Is there any way that I can let consumers know that my product contains nutrients without DVs, such as phosphatidylserine? You may make a statement about a nutrient for which there is no established Daily Value (DV) so long as the claim specifies only the amount of the nutrient per serving and does not imply that there is a lot or a little of that nutrient in the product (e.g., \"x grams of phosphatidylserine\"). You must list the dietary ingredient for which there is no DV and the quantitative amount of that dietary ingredient in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in the section below the nutrients with DVs. These dietary ingredients must be identified as having no DVs by the use of the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\" 21 CFR 101.13(i)(3) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)\n* 16._May I make statements using the words \"contains\" and \"provides\" for nutrients without DVs? Yes. You may use such statements if, and only if, you include the specific amount of the nutrient (e.g., \"Contains x grams of phosphatidylserine per serving\" or \"Provides x g of phosphatidylserine\"). 21 CFR 101.13(i)(3) and 101.54(c)(1)\n* 17._Is a statement outside of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel that describes the percentage of the RDI of a vitamin or mineral in my dietary supplement product a nutrient content claim? Yes. These claims are considered nutrient content claims and are not exempt from bearing a disclosure statement when required. 21 CFR 101.13(b)(1), (c) and (i) back to top\n* 18._Am I permitted to make a \"low\" or \"free\" claim when my dietary supplement product is specially processed? Yes. If a similar dietary supplement is normally expected to contain a nutrient and your dietary supplement is specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the food, remove the nutrient in the food, or not include the nutrient, then you are permitted to make a \"low\" or \"free\" claim as applicable.\n\n21 CFR 101.13(e)(1)\n* 19. May I make a \"low\" or \"free\" claim for my dietary supplement product if it is normally low in or free of a nutrient, and I use an appropriate disclaimer? No. However, a claim may be used if you indicate that it refers to all products of that type and not merely to that particular brand. 21 CFR 101.13(e)(2)\n* 20. Are claims such as \"100 percent milk free\" and \"contains no preservatives\" subject to the nutrient content claim requirements? No. Such statements are not nutrient content claims so long as they are not used in a nutrient context that would make them an implied claim under 21 CFR 101.13(b)(2). The statement \"100 percent milk free\" is generally a claim to facilitate avoidance of milk products. \"Contains no preservatives\" is a claim about a substance that does not have a nutritive function. 21 CFR 101.65(b)(1) and (b)(2)\n* 21. Is a \"no sugar\" claim subject to the nutrient content claim requirements? Yes. Sugar content claims are subject to the nutrient content claim requirements. 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)\n* 22. When can the nutrient content claim \"no added sugar\" be used? To avoid misleading consumers, the term \"no added sugar\" should be limited to dietary supplements containing no added sugars that are normally expected to contain them. 21 CFR 101.60(c)(2)(iv)\n* 23. Must a dietary supplement bearing a \"sugar free\" claim be labeled \"low calorie\"? No. A \"low calorie\" claim may not be made on dietary supplements, except when an equivalent amount of a dietary supplement that the labeled dietary supplement resembles and for which it substitutes (e.g., another protein supplement), normally exceeds the definition for \"low calorie.\" 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A)\n\nback to top\n\nAntioxidant Claims\n\nWhat is a nutrient content claim for antioxidants? It is a nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of one or more antioxidant nutrients present in a dietary supplement. 21 CFR 101.54(g)23.8.25.3.723\n\nMust the nutrient or dietary ingredient have an RDI to qualify for an antioxidant claim?\n\nYes, except as noted in question #28 below.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(1)\n\nAre there any other requirements for a dietary supplement to qualify for an antioxidant nutrient content claim?\n\nYes. The nutrients that are the subject of the claim must have recognized antioxidant activity. In addition, the level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must be sufficient to qualify for either \"high\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(b), \"good source\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(c), or \"more\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(e). For example, for a product to qualify for a \"high in antioxidant vitamin C\" claim, it must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C. That is, it must meet the level for \"high\" defined in $101.54(b). For a product to qualify for a \"good source of antioxidant vitamin C\" claim it must contain 10 to 19 percent of the RDI for vitamin C.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(2) and (g)(3)\n\nWhat do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n\nRecognized antioxidant activity means that there is scientific evidence that, following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(2)\n\nMay beta-carotene, which does not have an RDI, be the subject of an antioxidant claim?\n\nYes. You may make a claim for beta-carotene when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, you may make the claim \"good source of antioxidant beta-carotene\" when 10% or more of the RDI for vitamin A is present as beta-carotene.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(3)\n\nMust I list all antioxidants present in my product when making an antioxidant nutrient content claim?\n\nYes. The names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim must be included as part of the claim (e.g., \"high in antioxidant vitamins C and E\"). Alternatively, you may link the term \"antioxidant\" or \"antioxidants\" in a nutrient content claim (as in \"high in antioxidants\") by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity. This list should be in letters at least 1/16 of an inch in height or no smaller than half the type size of the largest nutrient content claim, whichever is larger.\n\n23.8.25.5.723\n\nCan I make other claims that describe the antioxidant properties of my product?Yes. You may craft a statement, subject to section 403(a) of the act (the false and misleading provisions), that describes how a dietary ingredient that does not have an RDI participates in antioxidant processes. Likewise, structure/function claims may be made about antioxidants as long as such claims are not false or misleading and, if appropriate, are made in accordance with section 403(r)(6) of the act (the provisions for statements of nutritional support). For example, a claim that reads \", involved in antioxidant processes\" would be acceptable as long as it is:\n\n1) truthful and not misleading; and\n\n2) meets the requirements of section 403(r)(6) of the act (see questions #44 through #51 of this chapter).\n\n62 FR 49868 at 49873 (September 23, 1997)\n\nHigh Potency Claims31. Can I use the term \"high potency\" to describe an individual nutrient?Yes. You may use the term \"high potency\" on your dietary supplement labels to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at 100 percent or more of the RDI per reference amount customarily consumed.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(i)\n\nCan the term \"high potency\" be used for combination products, such as botanicals with vitamins?Yes. However, when you use the term \"high potency\" to describe individual vitamins or minerals in your product that contains other nutrients or dietary ingredients, you must clearly identify which vitamin or mineral you are describing by the term \"high potency\" (e.g., \"Botanical 'X' with high potency vitamin E\").\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(ii)\n\nHow many nutrients must be present at 100% of the DV for a multinutrient product to qualify for the term \"high potency?\"You may use the term \"high potency\" on your multinutrient product to describe the product if it contains 100 percent or more of the RDI for at least two-thirds of the vitamins and minerals that are listed in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), and that are present in the product at 2 percent or more of the RDI (e.g., \"High potency multivitamin, multimineral dietary supplement tablets\").\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(2)\n\nPercentage Claims34. What is a percentage claim?It is a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which a reference daily intake (RDI) or daily reference value (DRV) has not been established. You may make a percentage claim on your products without a regulation that specifically defines such a statement. These statements must be accompanied by any disclosure statement required under 21 CFR 101.13(h). There are simple percentage claims and comparative percentage claims.\n\n21 CFR 101.13(q)(3)(ii)\n35.What is a simple percentage claim?\n\nIt is a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which there is no RDI or DRV (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, phytochemicals). The statement of the actual amount of the dietary ingredient per serving must be declared next to the percentage statement (e.g., \"4o percent omega-3 fatty acids, 10 mg per capsule\").\n\n21 CFR 101.13(q)(3)(ii)(A)\n36.What is a comparative percentage claim?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter VI.

(21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest 5 mg or mcg. The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, are folate and\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]\n\n2.2 Recommendations for declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels using RDIs for adults and children (\\geq) 4 years\n\nThis table provides recommendations for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals using only the RDIs that have been established for adults and children 4 years of age and older. Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), provide RDIs for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, and pregnant and lactating women. The declaration recommendations provided in this guidance can also be applied to the RDIs for these subpopulations.\n\nVII References\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,\" Advisory Report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture.

We also did not establish DRVs for trans fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, insoluble fiber, total sugars, or sugar alcohol for any population group.\n\nFigure 1: Table 1 \u2013 Daily Reference Values Used to Calculate Percent DV\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]\n\nWhich Units of Measure Have Changed?\n\nThe units of measure have changed for vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, and niacin. Where previously \"international units,\" or \"IU,\" was used for vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E, we now require the use of a metric unit of measure (mcg RAE for vitamin A, mcg for vitamin D, and mg (\\alpha)-tocopherol for vitamin E). The declarations of vitamin A and vitamin D will be expressed in mcg on the nutrition and supplement facts labels, and vitamin E will be expressed in mg (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The amount of vitamin D may also be expressed in IU, in addition to the mandatory declaration in mcg. Any declaration of the amount of vitamin D in IU must appear in parentheses after its declaration in mcg (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). This is allowed because vitamin D is a nutrient of public health significance, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine (IOM)) uses IU for vitamin D, and voluntary labeling in IU will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices (81 FR 33742 at 33912). For vitamin E, the use of this new unit of measure would account for the difference in activity between naturally occurring and synthetic vitamin E (81 FR 33742 at 33913).\n\nChanges regarding the labeling of folate have been made so that there is now consistency between conventional foods and dietary supplements. When the amount of folate is declared in the labeling of a conventional food or a dietary supplement, the name \"folate\" is to be listed for products containing folate (both natural and synthetic), folic acid, or a mixture of folate and folic acid. Polate is to be declared in mcg Dietary Polate Equivalents (DFE). The terms folic acid or folacin are no longer allowed to be used as synonyms for folate. They cannot be listed without parentheses in place of folate, and they cannot be added in parentheses immediately following folate, unless synthetic folic acid is added as a nutrient supplement to a product or a claim is made about it. In that case, the declaration of folic acid must be included, in parentheses after the declaration of folate, as a quantitative amount by weight (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)).\n\nThe unit of measure has changed for niacin, from \"mg\" to \"milligrams NE,\" where \"NE\" stands for \"niacin equivalents\" (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). However, only the amount will continue to be declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. The declaration of niacin content requires products to include both preformed niacin (from nicotinic acid and nicotinamide in the diet or niacin) and tryptophan, including those that may not contain preformed niacin. Compliance can be determined by measuring niacin and tryptophan separately; AOAC methods exist for both niacin and tryptophan (81 FR 33742 at 33915).\n\n11.2 How Do I Know if the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals is Mandatory or Voluntary?\n\nDeclaration is mandatory for the vitamins and minerals of public health significance, which have been updated and now are vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium. They must be listed in that order, and their declaration is mandatory on foods for adults and children 4 years of age and older, as well as on foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years of age, or pregnant women and lactating women (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)).\n\nVoluntary declaration is allowed for any other essential nutrient presented in Figure 2. However, if any of these nutrients is added to food as a nutrient supplement or if a claim is made about it on the label or in the labeling of foods, then mandatory declaration is required (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)).\n\n11.3 What Information Has to be Declared for Vitamins and Minerals?\n\nFor the vitamins and minerals of public health significance (vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium), the inclusion of both absolute amounts (quantitative amount by weight) and percent DV are required (except as described for labels in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)). However, if these nutrients are present at an amount less than 2 percent of the RDI, then the quantitative amounts and percentages of these nutrients are not required to be declared. They may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table and that is followed by the statement \"Contains less than 2percent of Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).\" Alternatively, except as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(f), if vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement \"Not a significant source of (listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)\" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nWhen any other nutrient listed in Figure 2 is added to a food as a nutrient supplement or when a claim is made about it (therefore triggering mandatory declaration), the declaration must include the amount per serving, expressed as percent DV, unless otherwise stated as both the quantitative amount by weight and percent DV (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)). Any nutrient (except folic acid) that is voluntarily declared must be declared as a percent of the RDI (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)) but declaring the quantitative amount by weight is voluntary (81 FR 33742 at 33947-48). The quantitative amount of folic acid must always be declared (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)). You must use the appropriate RDI, depending on which population group your food is represented or purported to be for (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(i)).\n\nZeros following the decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram) (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)). The phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label. For example, the RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values, and nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 (i.e. thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B({}{6}), vitamin B({}{12}), copper, and manganese) would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. In such situations, manufacturers could declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than can be scientifically supported. These rounding recommendations are explained in further detail in FDA's guidance for industry entitled \"Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\" (Ref. 3).\n\nHow Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.4543230533599854", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: (laboratory value / label value) x 100 = %\n\nIn order to evaluate the accuracy of nutrition label information against a standard for compliance purposes, FDA regulations define two nutrient classes (Class I and Class II) (2i CFR 101.9(g)(3)) and list a third group (Third Group) of nutrients (2i CFR 101.9(g)(5)). Class I nutrients are those added in fortified or fabricated foods. These nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. Class I nutrients must be present at 100% or more of the value declared on the label ; in other words, the nutrient content identified by the laboratory analysis must be at least equal to the label value. For example, if vitamin C is added in a fortified product and the label states that vitamin C is present at 10% Daily Value (DV), the laboratory value must equal at least 6 mg of vitamin C/serving (i.e., 10% of the 60 mg Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C that is specified in 2i CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The ratio between a laboratory finding of 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving (i.e., 8% DV) and the label value of 10% DV would be calculated as follows:\n\n(8% / 10%) x 100 = 80% or (4.8 mg / 6 mg) x 100 = 80%\n\nand the label value would not be in compliance.\n\nClass II nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat, or potassium that occur naturally in a food product. Class II nutrients must be present at 80% or more of the value declared on the label. As an example: If vitamin C is a naturally occurring nutrient in a product, and the product declares 10% DV vitamin C (i.e., 6 mg/serving) on its label, then laboratory analysis must find at least 80% of the label value (80% of 6 mg or 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving) for the product to be in compliance.\n\nThe Third Group nutrients include calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. However, for products (e.g., fruit drinks, juices, and confectioneries) with a sugars content of 90 percent or more of total carbohydrate, to prevent labeling anomalies due in part to rounding, FDA treats total carbohydrate as a Third Group nutrient instead of a Class II nutrient. For foods with label declarations of Third Group nutrients, the ratio between the amount obtained by laboratory analysis and the amount declared on the product label in the Nutrition Facts panel must be 120% or less, i.e., the label is considered to be out of compliance if the nutrient content of a composite of the product is greater than 20% above the value declared on the label. For example, if a laboratory analysis found 8 g of total fat/serving in a product that started that it contained 6 g of total fat/serving, the ratio between the laboratory value and the label value would be (8 / 6) x 100 = 133%, and the product label would be considered to be out of compliance.\n\nReasonable excesses of class I and II nutrients above labeled amounts and reasonable deficiencies of the Third Group nutrients are usually considered acceptable by the agency within good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhy Submit a Data Base to FDA?\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(8), compliance with the provisions set forth in 2i CFR 101.9(g)(1) through (g)(6) may be provided by use of an FDA approved data base that has been developed following FDA guideline procedures and where food samples have been handled in accordance with current good manufacturing practice to prevent nutrient loss. An approval is granted when FDA has agreed to all aspects of the data base in writing or when a clear need is presented (e.g., raw produce and seafood). Approvals are granted for a limited time and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices. Guidance in the use of data bases may be found in this document, the FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual--a Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.\n\nFDA published its policy concerning the review of data bases for use in the voluntary and mandatory nutrition labeling of foods in a final rule entitled \"Guidelines for the Voluntary Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruits, Vegetables, and Fish\" in the Federal Register of August 16, 1996 (6i FR 42742). This policy is the most recent such statement of the policy made by the agency and will be referred to throughout the manual.\n\nFDA states that upon submission of a data base, \"firms are free...to begin use of the nutrient label values and to initiate the planned studies to collect and update nutrient values. During this interim period, FDA does not anticipate that it will take action against a product bearing label values included in a data base submitted to the agency for review. If any product is identified through FDA compliance activities as including label values that are out of compliance, contingent on the company's willingness to come into compliance, the agency intends to work with both the manufacturer and the data base developer to understand and correct the problem label values\" (6i FR 42742).\n\n23.8.25.2.317.31\n\nChapter II: How to Develop a Nutrition Labeling Data Base\n\nFDA recommends five general steps that industry may choose to follow in the development of a nutrition labeling data base:\n\ncharacterizing the product(s);\n\ndesigning a sampling plan;\n\ncollecting the sample units;\n\nanalyzing the laboratory test samples; and\n\nstatistically analyzing the data and interpreting the results.\n\nThis chapter will address each of the five steps. Each of the steps can be performed in several different ways, and decisions made regarding the alternatives may directly impact the available resources, data quality (error in a data set), and the statistically defined risk of making a correct decision. Please note that this manual is not intended to be a statistics book or a comprehensive sampling text. Data base developers may need to consult the scientific literature, and in some cases, a statistician or research analyst to obtain additional detailed information that is relevant to the data base(s) of interest, but that is not contained in this manual.\n\nThis chapter, with the examples and definitions that are given, should serve as a general guide for individuals needing a basic reference concerning some of the administrative and statistical considerations that are associated with the development of a data base.\n\n1 Characterizing the Product(s)\n\nIn characterizing the product, one should first determine the innate nutrient makeup of the product and obtain preliminary estimates of nutrient levels, nutrient variation, and the factors that could impact nutrient levels and variation. The first step in describing a product or products is to perform a literature search to determine if there are (1) existing nutrient data; (2) estimates that describe the market (production and sales); and, if appropriate, (3) information that describes the varieties (or species, if applicable); (4) the regions where the food is grown or raised; and (5) factors already studied and known to impact or not to impact nutrient levels. If the scientific literature and other sources reveal that a nutrient is known to be absent from the food or is present in negligible amounts (e.g., sugars and dietary fiber in seafood, cholesterol and saturated fat in produce), then the agency will not require testing for that nutrient, as long as the data base developer includes supporting documentation (58 FR 2079 at 2019, January 6, 1993).\n\nIf no information is available that adequately describes the food and its nutrients, the data base developer may choose to perform a pilot study to determine if certain factors do impact nutrient levels, to determine if there are regional differences in the nutrient levels, or to test for nutrient losses over time. In addition, the developer may choose to include other relevant factors of interest in a proposal to collect nutrient data for a data base study. For fruits and vegetables, variability may arise from seasonal and geographic influences associated with such factors as variety, location (e.g., soil type, climatic conditions); growing conditions (e.g., planting time, irrigation and fertilization practices, harvest maturity); product transport (e.g, packing, shipping, storage); and processing practices. For seafoods, the variability in nutrient levels may arise from such factors as species, dietary habits, processing practices, etc. For \"mixed products\", in addition to the factors that influence the variation in the nutrient levels in the product ingredients, processing factors associated with the formulation of the product ingredients into the \"mixed product\" may also influence the variation in the nutrient levels of the finished product. In some instances, if there is a great difference in nutrient values attributable to a particular factor (e.g., different nutrient values for different food types), a data base developer may determine that the foods are different and may even consider different nutrition labels for different food types.\n\nWhen a data base developer submits a proposal to FDA, it is important to include the results of any pilot or experimental study that was completed. One data base developer, for example, completed a number of experimental studies that determined differences in nutrient levels between/among several independent variables (e.g., variety of food (2 levels), site of sampling (production vs. retail), packing medium (brine vs. water), geographical region (5 levels), and age of product (5 levels)). FDA requests that the results of any experimental study that is submitted to the agency be included in statistical tables to better describe the type(s) of statistical test used, the sample size, and the exact probability levels that were used in drawing conclusions based on these results.\n\nIn determining the sampling plan (next section), existing nutrient data are extremely helpful in determining the number of samples to test.\n\n2 Designing a Sampling Plan\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5701929330825806"], "As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Q4: What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n\nA4: An appropriate representation of the geriatric population (including patients with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities) should be enrolled in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in the geriatric population and allow for comparisons with the nongeriatric population. This information would ordinarily be expected in a marketing application. In general, it is preferable to include both nongeriatric and geriatric patients in the same study(ies), which can facilitate observation of age-related differences. In some cases, a separate study in the geriatric population can be preferable. Every effort should be made to include geriatric patients using concomitant therapies and with co-morbidities in the premarketing clinical development program. In some cases, enrollment of these patients can be challenging and it could be appropriate to collect data postmarketing. However, the adequacy of, and the need for, data in these patients should be considered during drug development and discussed in the marketing application submission. Where enrollment of geriatric patients has been insufficient despite the efforts of the applicant, a specific plan to collect data postmarketing should be discussed during development and presented in the marketing application. Information relevant to the geriatric patient population, including any limitations, should be reflected in the product labeling.\n\nQ5: Are there concerns related to the data specific to the geriatric population that could be considered in the planning of the clinical studies?\n\nDepending on the mechanism of action of the drug and/or the characteristics of the disease, certain specific adverse events and age-related efficacy endpoints should be actively sought in the geriatric population, e.g., effects on cognitive function, balance and falls, urinary incontinence or retention, weight loss, and sarcopenia. This may require specific testing, e.g., for cognitive function. Applicants should also refer to disease specific guidances for specific recommendations concerning the evaluation of both efficacy and safety in geriatric patients.\n\nQ6: In light of recent advances in the field of pharmacokinetics and assessment of drug-drug interactions since the ICH E7 guidance was established, what studies should be considered when developing a drug that will be used in geriatric patients?\n\nThe pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients (over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population) should be evaluated to identify age-related differences that are not explained by other factors such as reduced renal function or weight differences. The potential influence of impaired renal/hepatic function, as well as potential drug interactions, is often assessed in studies with nongeriatric subjects. Population pharmacokinetic analysis could provide the requested data if a sufficient number of patients in different age ranges (including patients (\\geq)65 and (\\geq)75 years) are included in the clinical trials. The applicability of population pharmacokinetics is dependent on several factors, e.g. the representation of the target population, the pharmacokinetics of the drug, dosing regimens, and analytical requirements. A specific pharmacokinetic study comparing nongeriatric and geriatric subjects in the same study (matched for relevant covariates, e.g., weight, sex) could achieve the same goals. More details on the pharmacokinetic approach (population pharmacokinetics, the appropriate design of a specific pharmacokinetic study) and assessment of drug-drug interactions can be discussed with the regulatory agencies.\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations; Geriatrics; Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.210097312927246", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important to ensure that the experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities of relevant stakeholders relating to the development and evaluation of the drug throughout its lifecycle are captured and meaningfully incorporated into drug development planning.\n\nClinical development may also feature requirements for co-development of validated biomarkers, diagnostic testing, or devices that facilitate the safe and effective use of a drug.\n\nThe types of studies that can contribute to drug development are described in subsections IV.2 (4.2) and IV.3 (4.3) and summarized in the Annex.\n\nQuality of Investigational Medicinal Product (4.1)\n\nEnsuring adequate quality and characterization of physicochemical properties of investigational medicinal product is an important element in planning a drug development program and is addressed in ICH and regional quality guidances. More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug's chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug's benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.029795711860060692", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Drugs should be studied in all age groups, including the elderly, for which they will have significant utility.

It likewise applies when the new formulation or new combination is likely to alter the geriatric patient's response (with regard to either safety/ tolerability or efficacy) compared with that of the non-geriatric patient in a way different from previous formulations.

It is also important not to exclude unnecessarily patients with concomitant illnesses; it is only by observing such patients that drug-disease interactions can be detected.

This document has been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, June 24, 1993. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and the USA. This guidance was published in the Federal Register on August 2, 1994 (59 FR 39398) and is applicable to drug and biological products. In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under SS 10.90(b) [21 CFR 10.90(b)], which provides for the use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising SS10.90(b). Therefore, this guideline is not being issued under the authority of SS10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges or benefits for or on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way.

An electronic version of this guideline is also available via Internet by connecting to the CDER FTP server (CDVS2.CDER.FDA.GOV) using the FTP protocol.\n\nDrugs should be studied in all age groups, including the elderly, for which they will have significant utility. Patients entering clinical trials should be reasonably representative of the population that will be later treated by the drug.\n\n3 SCOPE OF GUIDELINE\n\nThis guideline is directed principally toward new molecular entities that are likely to have significant use in the elderly, either because the disease intended to be treated is characteristically a disease of aging (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) or because the population to be treated is known to include substantial numbers of geriatric patients (e.g., hypertension). The guideline applies also to new formulations and new combinations of established medicinal products when there is specific reason to expect that conditions common in the elderly (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment, impaired cardiac function, concomitant illnesses or concomitant medications) are likely to be encountered and are not already dealt with in current labeling. It likewise applies when the new formulation or new combination is likely to alter the geriatric patient's response (with regard to either safety/tolerability or efficacy) compared with that of the non-geriatric patient in a way different from previous formulations. The guideline also applies to new uses that have significant potential applicability to the elderly.\n\nIt is recommended that exemptions from the guideline be determined in advance either by sponsors or, where feasible, by the sponsor and drug registration authorities, based, e.g., on estimates of the disease prevalence by age or through examination of the age distribution of usage for other drugs of the same class or drugs used for the same indication.\n\n4 Definition of the population\n\nThe geriatric population is arbitrarily defined, for the purpose of this guideline, as comprising patients aged 65 years or older. It is important, however, to seek patients in the older age range, 75 and above, to the extent possible. Protocols should not ordinarily include arbitrary upper age cutoffs. It is also important not to exclude unnecessarily patients with concomitant illnesses; it is only by observing such patients that drug-disease interactions can be detected. The older the population likely to use the drug, the more important it is to include the very old.\n\n5 Clinical experience\n\nGeriatric patients should be included in the Phase 3 database (and in Phase 2, at the sponsor's option) in meaningful numbers. The geriatric subpopulation should be represented sufficiently to permit the comparison of drug response in them to that of younger patients. For drugs used in diseases not unique to, but present in, the elderly, a minimum of 100 patients would usually allow detection of clinically important differences. For drugs to treat relatively uncommon diseases, smaller numbers of the elderly would be expected. Where the disease to be treated is characteristically associated with aging (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) it is expected that geriatric patients will constitute the major portion of the clinical database.\n\nThe overall database of the dossier should be examined for the presence of age-related differences, e.g., in adverse event rates, in effectiveness, and in dose-response. If these relatively crude overview analyses show important differences, further evaluation may be needed.\n\nThe geriatric data used in the overview can come either from the inclusion of elderly patients in all or most of the main Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 studies or from studies conducted exclusively in geriatric patients, at the sponsor's option. Inclusion of both groups in the same studies has the advantage of allowing direct comparisons of younger and older patients using data collected in similar ways. Such comparisons are more difficult when separate studies of young and old patients are used. Certain assessments, however, e.g., studies of cognitive function, require special planning and can be best accomplished in separate studies.\n\n6 Pharmacokine Studies\n\nMost of the recognized important differences between younger and older patients have been pharmacokinetic differences, often related to impairment of excretory (renal or hepatic) function or to drug-drug interactions. It is important to determine whether or not the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug in elderly subjects or patients is different from that in younger adults and to characterize the effects of influences, such as abnormal renal or hepatic function, that are more common in the elderly even though they can occur in any age group. Information regarding age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of the drug can come, at the sponsor's option, either from a Pharmacokine Screen (as described subsequently) or from formal pharmacokinetic studies, in the elderly and in patients with excretory functional impairment.\n\nIt is recognized that for certain drugs and applications (e.g., some topically-applied agents, some proteins) technical limitations such as low systemic drug levels may preclude or limit exploration of age-related pharmacokinetic differences.\nFormal PK studies can be done either in healthy geriatric subjects or in patient volunteers with the disease to be treated by the drug.\n\nThe initial PK study can be a pilot trial of limited size conducted under steady-state conditions to look for sizable differences between older and younger subjects or patients. A larger, single-dose PK study of sufficient size to permit statistical comparisons between geriatric and younger subjects' or patients' pharmacokinetic profiles is also acceptable.\n\nIn either case, if large (i.e., potentially medically important) age-related differences are found, the initial PK study may need to be followed by a multiple-dose PK study of sufficient size to permit statistical comparisons (geriatric vs. younger) at steady-state.\n\nB. Pharmacokine Screening Approach\n\nSponsors may opt, instead of conducting a separate PK evaluation of the elderly, to utilize a pharmacokinetic screen in conjunction with the main Phase 3 (and Phase 2, if the sponsor wishes) clinical trials program. This screening procedure involves obtaining, under steady-state conditions, a small number (one or two) of drug blood level determinations at \"trough\" (i.e., just prior to the next dose) or other defined times from sufficient numbers of Phase 2/3 clinical trials patients, geriatric and younger, to detect age-associated differences in pharmacokinetic behavior, if they are present. It is important to record time of dosing prior to blood concentration measurements, and relation of dosing to meals, and to examine the influence of demographic and disease factors, such as gender renal function, presence of liver disease, gastrointestinal disease or heart disease, body size and composition, and concomitant illnesses.\n\nSmall differences are unlikely to be of medical importance. Where the screen detects large differences, formal pharmacokinetic studies may be indicated unless the screen's results are sufficiently informative.\n\nThe advantage of a pharmacokinetic screen is that it can assess the effects, not only of age itself, but also of other factors associated with age (altered body composition, other drugs, concomitant illness) and their interactions.\n\n7 Pharmacokineics in Renaly or Hepatically Impaired Patients\n\nRenal impairment is an aging-associated finding that can also occur in younger patients. Therefore, it is a general principle, not specific to these guidelines, that drugs excreted (parent drug or active metabolites) significantly through renal mechanisms should be studied to define the effects of altered renal function on their pharmacokinetics. Such information is needed for drugs that are the subject of this guideline but it can be obtained in younger subjects with renal impairment.\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.544614791870117", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor a study intended to serve as a bridging study, the following points should be considered:\n\n2.2.2 Planning\n\nThe multi-regional trial would have to satisfy requirements of the region where the application is to be filed with respect to design and analysis (see answer to Q1). In general, a multi-regional study should be designed with sufficient numbers of subjects so that there is adequate power to have a reasonable likelihood of showing an effect in each region of interest. Minor differences in design (e.g., age inclusion criteria, concomitant medication, etc.) may be acceptable and prior discussion with regulatory agencies is encouraged. For safety evaluation, it is important to make as uniform as possible the method for collection and assessment of safety information among regions.\n\n2.2.3 Analysis\n\nGiven the goal of the multi-regional bridging study, it is critical to provide efficacy and safety results by region, with attention given to the usual analyses (e.g., demographic and baseline variables, patient disposition). It will be of interest also to examine consistency of effects across regions. In a dose response study, it will be especially important to analyze dose response relationships for efficacy and safety both within the regions and across the regions.\n\n2.2.4 Evaluation\n\nIt is difficult to generalize about what study results would be judged persuasive, as this is clearly a regional determination, but a \"hierarchy of persuasiveness\" can be described.\n\nStand Alone Regional Result\n\nThe most persuasive would be demonstration of the effect in the entire study, with the results of each region of interest also demonstrating a statistically significant result. It will also be important to compare results across regions.\n\nNo Significant Regional Result But Similar Results Across Regions\n\nWith an effect demonstrated in the entire study, an analysis of results by region might not show a significant result in a region of interest but the data might nonetheless be persuasive to regulators in that region. Consistent trends in endpoint(s) intended for comparison across the regions or, in the case of a dose-response study, similar dose-response relationships across regions, might support an argument that the drug is not sensitive to intrinsic or extrinsic ethnic factors. Other data, for example, from approved drugs in the same class within region(s) could support such a bridging conclusion.\n\nOther consideration\n\nThis Q&A discusses use of multi-regional studies as bridging studies. There are other possible uses of multi-regional studies. For example, at an early stage of development, such studies could compare various endpoints in an exploratory setting in different regions to guide a synchronized global development plan.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry E5 \u2013 Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data Questions and Answers\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.6072587966918945", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: The geriatric data used in the overview can come either from the inclusion of elderly patients in all or most of the main Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 studies or from studies conducted exclusively in geriatric patients, at the sponsor's option.

[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3.

Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) \"GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline\" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as \"a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\"17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject's legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is \"a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection.\" We consider an IEC to be \"adequately constituted\" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC's functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered \"adequately constituted\" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as \"a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.\"19 Informed consent is \"documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.\"20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC's written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., \"Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z\"); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., \"Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z\").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA's review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor's/applicant's compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission's cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor's compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (\"List and Description of Investigators\") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 \"Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports\"23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.3168274760246277", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Research With Noncommercial Intent\n\nSome believe that the IND regulations do not apply to clinical investigations that are not intended to investigate a drug's potential for commercial sale. Whether the IND regulations apply to a planned clinical investigation does not depend on whether the intent of the clinical investigation is commercial or noncommercial. Therefore, these types of studies would require an IND under part 312, unless they meet the criteria for an exemption in SSSS 312.2(b) or 320.31(b) (see section IV) or the criteria in SS 361.1, or the compound used is labeled with a cold isotope and used in the manner described in section V.\n\nVII Frequently asked questions\n\n1 Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?\n\nIf you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an unlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However, if you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the drug's ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance).\n\nIf a drug marketed for use in adults is studied in an investigator-initiated, single-center study involving children, is an IND needed?\n\nAn IND is required under part 312 unless the clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption in SS 312.2(b) (see section IV.A). The criterion of most importance for the exemption in this situation is whether the change in study population from adult to pediatric, or any other condition of use in the study, would significantly increase the risks (or decrease the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)). Whether risk would be significantly increased would depend on a variety of factors, including, for example, the age of the pediatric population being studied, the extent of prior pediatric experience with the drug in clinical studies or clinical practice, the amount of information available to support dosing in the study population, and the overall toxicity profile of the drug.\n\nThere are drugs on the market that have not been approved by FDA. Do clinical investigations using those drugs need an IND?\n\nThere are certain currently marketed drug ingredients that were first marketed before Congress passed the FD&C Act of 1938 (requiring demonstration of safety before marketing) or before it passed the 1962 amendments to the FD&C Act (requiring demonstration of effectiveness and safety before marketing). Sponsors of clinical investigations that use products with theseingredients should consult with FDA to determine whether the ingredient is lawfully marketed.23 If the ingredient is not lawfully marketed, an IND is required under part 312.\n\nFootnote 23: Ordinarily, such inquiries would be directed to CDER, Office of Compliance, Office of Unapproved Drugs & Labeling Compliance.\n\n4. Can I do research on radiolabeled endogenous peptides, such as neuropeptides, without an IND?\n\nIf the research is intended to obtain basic information about the metabolism of the peptide or its role in physiology, pathophysiology, and biochemistry, and the criteria in 21 CFR 361.1 are met (i.e., among other things, the dose of endogenous peptide to be administered is known not to cause a clinically detectable pharmacologic effect in humans), an IND is not required (see the RDRC guidance). However, if the study hypothesis concerns the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a disease in patients, or the criteria in SS 361.1 are otherwise not met, an IND is required under part 312.\n\n5. Do clinical investigations of positron emission tomography (PET) drugs need INDs?\n\nAn IND generally would be required for a PET drug investigation, unless the investigation meets the criteria in 21 CFR 361.1. To meet these criteria, the research must be intended to obtain basic information regarding the metabolism (including kinetics, distribution, and localization) of a radioactively labeled drug or regarding human physiology, pathophysiology, or biochemistry, but not intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes or to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug in humans for such purposes (i.e., to carry out a clinical trial) (21 CFR 361.1(a)).\n\n6. If a complementary or an alternative medicine that was derived from organic materials from a botanical source (e.g., broccoli, sprouts) is administered to subjects to study cancer prevention, is an IND required?\n\nA clinical investigation of a complementary or an alternative medicine derived from organic materials that is intended to evaluate the medicine's ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease requires an IND under part 312.24\n\nFootnote 24: See the guidance for industry on Rotanical Drug Products.\n\n7. Is an IND required if a product containing attenuated microorganisms is evaluated for amelioration of symptoms of a disease or prevention of the disease?\n\nEven when a microorganism is attenuated with the intention to increase safety of a product, a clinical investigation that evaluates the potential for that microorganism to relieve symptoms of a disease or prevent the disease requires an IND under part 312, unless the study meets the criteria for an exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf a product containing substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food is administered to subjects in a study intended to evaluate the effect of the substance on the pathogenesis of a human disease, is an IND required?\n\nSubstances designated as GRAS for use in food are generally not approved as drug products. A clinical investigation of a GRAS substance that is intended to evaluate the product's ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease requires an IND under part 312, unless the substance to be studied is also a lawfully marketed drug and the clinical investigation meets the criteria for exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b).\n\nFor purposes of the exemption from the IND requirements for studies using radioisotopes and FDA's exercise of enforcement discretion for studies using cold isotopes, what support is needed to determine that the labeled drug does not have a clinically detectable pharmacological effect?\n\nThere is no requirement for a formal dose-response study to define the lower threshold for a clinically detectable pharmacological effect, and, in some cases, a study may not be needed. For example, if the labeled drug is an endogenous compound and the circulating blood levels or excretion rates of the endogenously produced substance are well known, there could be a basis to conclude that some small fraction of these levels or rates of administration (e.g., administration over a given interval of a very low percentage of the amount of a substance that is produced endogenously during the same interval) represents an amount without detectable pharmacological effect. Similarly, if large amounts of a substance such as an amino acid or a sugar are regularly consumed as foodstuffs, it may be possible to conclude that consumption of a small amount of these substances (e.g., a small percentage of the amount usually consumed during a meal), at least by the oral route, would be without detectable pharmacological activity (also see footnote 11).\n\n10. Do I need an IND if my study uses a home-made version of a lawfully marketed drug?\n\nSome investigators, or research pharmacies affiliated with the institution in which an investigator is conducting a study, compound their own versions of lawfully marketed drug products for use in clinical studies. For example, FDA is aware of instances in which the methacholine used in respiratory studies for challenge purposes has been prepared locally from raw materials obtained from a chemical supply company. Studies that use a drug product that is prepared from raw materials in place of the approved, finished product marketed by the manufacturer must be conducted under an IND (21 CFR part 312). These studies cannot meet the criteria for an exemption from the IND requirements for marketed drugs (SS 312.2(b)) because the drug product manufactured by the investigator or research pharmacy is not considered to be the lawfully marketed drug.\n\n11. Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only a small number of subjects?\n\nThe number of subjects enrolled has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND regulations. The definition of clinical investigation specifically includes studies with as few as one subject (see section III.B).\n\n12 Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only healthy volunteers?\n\nThe clinical condition of study subjects (e.g., the presence or absence of disease) has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND requirements in part 312. The definition of clinical investigation refers only to subjects involved in an experiment. It makes no distinction between healthy subjects or those with a disease (see section III.B).\n\nVIII Process for addressing novelties concerning the application of the IND requirements\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1523802280426025", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product?

If a sponsor is uncertain, however, we recommend that the sponsor contact the appropriate review division (i.e., for the therapeutic area being studied) in the appropriate FDA center for advice about whether the IND regulations apply (21 CFR 312.2(e)). For products regulated by CDER, an inquiry concerning the application of the IND regulations should be directed to the Chief, Project Management Staff, in the appropriate CDER review division. For products regulated by CBER, the inquiry should be directed to the applications division of the appropriate review Office.\n\nOrganizational charts listing the CDER review divisions and their telephone numbers are available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OrganizationCharts/ucm135674.htm.\n\nOrganizational charts listing the CBER review divisions and their telephone numbers are available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/_OrganizationCharts/ucm135943.htm.\n\nIf the relevant review division is not known, we recommend the sponsor contact CDER's Division of Drug Information (druginfo@fda.hhs.gov) or CBER's Division of Manufacturer's Assistance and Training (matt@cber.fda.gov), Office of Communication, Outreach and Development (both addresses and telephone numbers are provided on the second title page of this guidance).\n\nFDA will categorize inquiries concerning the application of the IND regulations as either informal or formal based on the following factors:\n\nThe medium in which the inquiry is received\n\nThe relative complexity of the inquiry\n\nThe type of response requested by the inquirer or given by FDA\n\nInformal inquiries have the following features:\n\nThey can be communicated either orally or in writing (written communication includes email, fax, or other written correspondence).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]\n\nAppendix\n\nOther Guidances that May Be Relevant to Questions Concerning\n\nthe Application of the IND Requirements\n\nFDA has issued guidances in related areas.

[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 21: Regulations regarding treatment INDs and IDEs also use the terminology \u201cmay be effective.\u201d A request for a treatment IND for a drug or biologic intended to treat an immediately life-threatening disease may be granted when, among other things, there is evidence that the drug may be effective for its intended use in its intended population (21 CFR 312.320(a)(3)(ii)). For devices, a treatment IDE may be withdrawn if FDA determines that the available scientific evidence fails to provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the device \u201cmay be effective for its intended population\u201d (21 CFR 812. 36(d)(2)(iv)(A)). It should be noted that FDA\u2019s decisions on requests for EUAs and treatment INDs and IDEs involve product-specific and circumstance-dependent determinations of risks and benefits. FDA also notes that the amount, type, and quality of evidence available to support an EUA may not always be the same as that required for expanded access, IDEs, or humanitarian device exemptions under the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\n2.2.2 Risk-Benefit Analysis\n\nA product may be considered for an EUA if the Commissioner determines that the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat the identified disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. In making this assessment, FDA must take into consideration the material threat posed by the CBRN agent(s) identified in the HHS Secretary's declaration of emergency or threat of emergency if applicable (section 564(c)).\n\nIn determining whether the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, FDA intends to look at the totality of the scientific evidence to make an overall risk-benefit determination. Such evidence, which could arise from a variety of sources, may include (but is not limited to): results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, and in vitro data, available for FDA consideration. FDA will also assess the quality and quantity of the available evidence, given the current state of scientific knowledge. The types of evidence that FDA may consider and that should be submitted to support a request for an EUA are discussed more fully in section 3.2.2 of this guidance.\n\n2.2.3 No Alternatives\n\nFor FDA to issue an EUA, there must be no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the candidate product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the disease or condition. A potential alternative product may be considered \"unavailable\" if there are insufficient supplies of the approved alternative to fully meet the emergency need. A potential alternative product may be considered \"inadequate\" if, for example, there are contraindicating data for special circumstances or populations (e.g., children, immunocompromised individuals, or individuals with a drug allergy), if a dosage form of an approved product is inappropriate for use in a special population (e.g., a tablet for individuals who cannot swallow pills), or if the agent is or may be resistant to approved and available alternative products.\n\n2 Categories of Products\n\nMCMs that may be considered for an EUA include unapproved products as well as approved products intended for unapproved uses.22 Examples of \"unapproved uses of approved products\" include:\n\nFootnote 22: EUAs may be requested and issued to authorize prescribing for unapproved uses of approved products, often referred to as \u201coff-label\u201d uses because, under emergency circumstances, licensed prescribers may not be able to make the case-by-case individual patient prescribing decisions that occur within the practice of medicine. CDC, for example, may act as the nation\u2019s doctor in recommending an unapproved use of an approved product. In such cases, CDC may request that FDA issue an EUA to authorize such unapproved use, often with the intended purpose of preserving liability protections afforded under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, described in section VI of this guidance.\n\nUse of an approved antibiotic as prophylaxis based on exposure to, or treatment of, a disease caused by a bacterium (or class of bacteria) that is not included in the indications and usage section of the approved labeling for the antibiotic;\n\nSubstitution of a critical reagent of a cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) with another reagent that has not been cleared for use with the device.\n\nSubmission of an IND or IDE is not required for potential EUA products, although FDA anticipates that many unapproved products for which an EUA is requested will already be under evaluation through such mechanisms. In fact, human data derived in the course of studies conducted under an IND or IDE may help to support an FDA conclusion that the available evidence is adequate to support an EUA consistent with the statutory criteria for issuance.\n\n3 Pre-EUA Activities and Submissions\n\nEarly engagement between an industry or government sponsor23 and FDA about potential EUA products will facilitate more complete EUA requests and enhance FDA's ability to review and ultimately grant the EUA as appropriate. FDA also recognizes that circumstances can change rapidly, and planning for a potential emergency may unexpectedly transition to a response effort. Therefore, FDA strongly encourages the sponsor of a product that might be considered for an EUA, particularly one at an advanced stage of development, to contact the appropriate FDA Center before submitting a formal request for an EUA. For purposes of this guidance, these submissions and related interactions are referred to as \"pre-EUA\" activities.\n\nFootnote 23: For purposes of this guidance, the term \u201csponsor\u201d is used when referring to the applicant, submitter, or person requesting an EUA. If specifically referring to a government or industry sponsor only, then \u201cgovernment\u201d or \u201cindustry\u201d is used as an adjective to describe the specific type of sponsor, e.g. government sponsor or industry sponsor.\n\nFDA's review of a pre-EUA submission is not an indication of FDA's views on the product's potential to be used under an EUA, or that the sponsor has obtained or submitted all the information necessary for FDA to review a formal request for consideration of an EUA. Pre-EUA activities are not a substitute for sponsor efforts to develop the product toward approval, including submission and, when appropriate, implementation of proposals for clinical trialsdesigned to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition to design and implementation of clinical trials for development efforts in non-emergency settings, for some MCMs and for some emergency response plans, FDA encourages sponsors to design and propose appropriately controlled clinical trials that could be conducted during the emergency response either to run in parallel with an EUA or instead of an EUA.\n\nPre-EUA activities may include discussions with FDA about a potential EUA product. Such discussions may occur prior to the submission of a formal request for consideration of an EUA or issuance by the HHS Secretary of an EUA declaration. They may also include discussions about the appropriate vehicle to use (e.g., IND or IDE, Master File, pre-EUA submission) for submitting data on the product prior to submission of a formal request for consideration of an EUA.\n\nGenerally, FDA recommends that a sponsor submitting data as part of \"pre-EUA\" activities follow recommendations for submitting pre-IND, IND, and device pre-submissions to the relevant medical product Center.24 A \"pre-EUA\" submission is typically separate from other developmental submissions on file with FDA; its existence does not imply that any specific set of qualifications has been met but represents the initiation of a series of preliminary interactions to discuss potential suitability for EUA consideration. In addition, FDA requests that the sponsor follow the recommendations for the content of the submission outlined in section III.D.2 of this guidance and for the format of the submission contained in section III.D.3 of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 24: For detailed information on meetings about product development with CDER and CBER, see FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants (Revision 1).

If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on information to include in support of parametric release for sterile products2 terminally sterilized by moist heat when submitting a new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), new animal drug application (NADA), abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA), biologics license application (BLA), or supplement or other postmarketing report.\n\nFootnote 2: The term product includes final products that are regulated by CDER, CVM, and CBER.\n\nFootnote 3: See 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii)(a) or 21 CFR 514.1(b)(5)(vii)(b).\n\nCurrently, FDA requires that sterile products meet certain sterility requirements before release to the market.3.4 In many cases, the requirements for batch release are fulfilled by conducting a sterility test on finished units drawn from the batch. Parametric release is defined as a sterility assurance release program where demonstrated control of the sterilization process enables a firm to use defined critical process controls, in lieu of the sterility test, to fulfill the intent of 21 CFR 211.165(a), and 211.167(a).5 Under this strategy, market release of terminally sterilized products can be based upon meeting the defined sterilization parameters and not on performing an approved sterility test. Meeting the requirements of the parametric release process can provide greater assurance that a batch meets the sterility requirement than can be achieved with a sterility test of finished units drawn from the batch.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 211.167(a) for drug products or 21 CFR 610.12 for biologic products. In addition, refer to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapters: (<)1(>) (Injections), (<)71(>) (Sterility), and (<)1041(>) (Biologicals). Short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, including positron emission tomography (PET) drugs, are subject to sterility testing; however, they may be released prior to completion of this test (21 CFR 211.165(a)).\n\nFootnote 5: For information on how current good manufacturing practices will be applied for products subject to parametric release that are within the scope of this guidance, see the FDA Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 460.800.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\n[150] Risk Assessment, Process Understanding, and Prior Knowledge\n\n[152] Successful parametric release systems are based on the reliability of the control strategy of the sterility assurance program. We recommend that your risk assessment focus on the risk of failure to achieve the minimum required probability of a non-sterile unit for each unit of every batch. The risk assessment should include the following:\n\n[153] Consistency of performance of the terminal sterilization cycle within the validated limits.\n\n[154] A discussion of risk to the sterility of the product relative to the following: (1) the production terminal sterilization cycle, (2) the production loading patterns, (3) the container closure system (including secondary packaging), and (4) any potential contamination risks from the environment (as appropriate). For an approved application, you should indicate any changes to the above items and provide an assessment of the risk to the sterility of the product associated with those changes. For example, although the established minimum sterilization time cannot be lowered, the maximum sterilization time can be increased if the appropriate stability data are provided to support the increase.\n\n[167] Experience with the proposed or similar product (and container closure system) and proposed or similar sterilization process, the overall risks to sterility, and the steps you have taken to assess and control these risks. For new products, prior knowledge from developmental and registration/exhibit batches may suffice.\n\n[168] A discussion of your overall prior knowledge and production and testing experience relevant to the drug product that will be subject to parametric release.\n\n[169] Documentation for Parametric Release Process\n\n[170] The following information specific to the proposed parametric release process should also be included in your submission:\n\n[171] A citation to a complete and detailed description of the current relevant terminal sterilization cycle.\n\n[172] Identification of the critical process parameters (process/cycle parameters and appropriate load monitors essential for product release) for the product(s) proposed for parametric release, including the minimum and maximum limits for these critical parameters. The critical process parameters should be within the limits that have been validated and approved for sterility assurance of the subject product(s).\n\n[173] **Acknowledgement that adherence to the critical parameters of the parametric release program will substitute for the performance of a sterility test as the primary release criterion for the product and that sterility test results from the finished product will not be used to overrule any failure to meet the acceptance criteria of the parametric release program. In the event of failure, the specific sterilizer load will be rejected by the quality control unit and will not be released unless there is a provision for reprocessing.\n\nAcknowledgement that regardless of the batch release technique used, any specimen tested according to the reference test method for sterility (e.g., compendium or FDA regulations) will meet the criteria for sterility (such as during testing for stability or postmarketing investigations).\n\nA description of the sterilization load monitor that indicates the following: (1) the type of monitor being proposed, (2) how the load monitor will be used and analyzed, (3) what functions are being measured by the monitor, and (4) the rationale for the location of the monitor. Additionally, for indirect monitors, we recommend that you include a statement justifying the classification of the indirect indicator that you are using as defined by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI 2008). In certain circumstances a Class 3 indicator may be appropriate; however, a Class 5 indicator is recommended for most situations.\n\nDocumentation of the control system to verify exposure of the load to the sterilization process.\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission of Documentation in Applications for Parametric Release of Human and Veterinary Drug Products Terminally Sterilized by Moist Heat Processes Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.319103240966797", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: orIndustry/UCM052487.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm xi}) CVM GFI #64: Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology (July 1999).\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/Guidancef\n\norIndustry/UCM052379.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm xi}) CVM GFI #93/VICH GL11(R): Impurities in New Veterinary Medicinal Products (Revised) (November 2007).\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/Guidancef\n\norIndustry/UCM052432.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm iii}) United States Pharmacopoeia Chapter (<)661(>)Containers-Plastics.

An electronic version of this guidance is also available via Internet via World Wide Web (WWW) (connect to the FDA Home Page at WWW.FDA.GOV/CDER and go to the \"Regulatory Guidance\" section).\n\nFOR THE SUBMISSION OF\n\nDOCUMENTATION FOR STERILIZATION PROCESS VALIDATION IN APPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN AND VETERINARY DRUG PRODUCTS\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Purpose\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for the submission of information and data in support of the efficacy of sterilization processes in drug applications for both human and veterinary drugs. The recommendations in the guidance apply to applications for sterile drug products (new drug applications, new animal drug applications, abbreviated new drug applications, abbreviated antibiotic applications, and abbreviated new animal drug applications). These recommendations also apply to previously approved applications when supplements associated with the sterile processing of approved drugs are submitted. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may also be necessary in investigational new drug and investigational new animal drug applications.\n\nIn the FEDERAL REGISTER of October 11, 1991 (56 FR 51354), the agency published a proposed rule entitled \"Use of Aseptic Processing and Terminal Sterilization in the Preparation of Sterile Pharmaceuticalsfor Human and Veterinary Use.\" This guidance is not a substitution for or a supplement to that proposed rule. Regardless of whether the applicant uses terminal sterilization or aseptic processing to manufacture a drug product that is purported to be sterile, certain information about the validation of that process should be submitted for both of those types of sterilization.\n\nAppendix B Documenting Sterilization Process Validation\n\nThe efficacy of a given sterilization process for a specific drug product is evaluated on the basis of a series of protocols and scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that the sterilization process and associated control procedures can reproducibly deliver a sterile product. Data derived from experiments and control procedures allow conclusions to be drawn about the probability of nonsterile product units (sterility assurance level). Based on the scientific validity of the protocols and methods, as well as on the scientific validity of the results and conclusions, the agency concludes that the efficacy of the sterilization process is validated.\n\nWhether a drug product is sterilized by a terminal sterilization process or by an aseptic filling process, the efficacy of the sterilization process may be validated without the manufacture of three production batches.\n\nSterilization process validation data, however, should be generated using procedures and conditions that are fully representative and descriptive of the procedures and conditions proposed for manufacture of the product in the application.\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER's) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM's) review of the validation of the sterilization process consists of a scientific evaluation of the studies submitted in the applications. This review is conducted by FDA's review staff, and is part of a cooperative effort between the review staff, compliance staff, and field investigators to ensure the overall state of control of the sterile processing of human and veterinary drug products. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may be provided directly to the application or by specific reference to a drug master file (DMF), a veterinary master file (VMF), or another application. Letters of authorization to refer to the referenced files should be included.\n\nAppendix C Remarks\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide recommendations for the types of information applicants should include in human and animal drug applications.

Identify the autoclave(s) to be used for production sterilization, including manufacturer and model.\n4. Autoclave Loading Patterns A description of representative autoclave loading patterns should be provided.\n5. Methods and Controls to Monitor Production Cycles Methods and controls used to monitor routine production cycles (e.g., thermocouples, pilot bottles, and biological indicators) should be described, including the number and location of each as well as acceptance and rejection specifications.\n6. Requalification of Production Autoclaves A description of the program for routine and unscheduled requalification of production autoclaves, including frequency, should be provided.\n7. Reprocessing A description and validation summary of any program that provides for reprocessing (e.g., additional thermal processing) of product should be provided. Please note that the stability program is also affected by additional thermal processing. For further information concerning the stability program, reference is made to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research \"Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics\" and to the Center for Veterinary Medicine \"Drug Stability Guideline.\"\n8. Thermal Qualification of the Cycle\n9. Heat Distribution and Penetration Studies Heat distribution and penetration study protocols and data summaries that demonstrate the uniformity, reproducibility, and conformance to specifications of the production sterilization cycle should be provided. Results from a minimum of three consecutive, successful cycles should be provided to ensure that the results are consistent and meaningful.\n2. Thermal Monitors The number of thermal monitors used and their location in the chamber should be described. A diagram is helpful.\n3. The Effects of Loading on Thermal Input Data should be generated with minimum and maximum load to demonstrate the effects of loading on thermal input to product. Additional studies may be necessary if different fill volumes are used in the same container line. Data summaries are acceptable for these purposes. A summary should consist of, for example, high and low temperatures (range), average temperature during the dwell period, minimum and maximum (F_{0}) values, dwell time, run date and time, and identification of the autoclave(s) used. These data should have been generated from studies carried out in production autoclave(s) that will be used for sterilization of the product that is the subject of the application.\n4. Information Included in the Batch Record The batch record supplied with the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the application should identify the validated processes to be used for sterilization and for depyrogenation of any container-closure components. This information can be included in the batch record by reference to the validation protocol or standard operating procedure (SOP). Validation information should be provided as described above.\n\nMicrobiological Efficacy of the Cycle Validation studies that demonstrate the efficacy (Iethality) of the production cycle should be provided. A sterility assurance of 10-6 or better should be demonstrated for any terminal sterilization process. This level of sterility assurance should be demonstrated for all parts of the drug product (including the container and closure, if applicable), which are claimed to be sterile. The specific type of study and the methods used to carry out the study (or studies) are product and process specific and may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. In general, the following types of information and data should be provided.\n\nIdentification and Characterization of Bioburden Organisms Describe the methods and results from studies used to identify and characterize bioburden organisms. The amount and type of information supplied may be dependent on the validation strategy chosen. For example, more information may be needed for bioburden-based autoclave processes than for overkill processes. Information concerning the number, type, and resistance of bioburden organisms may be necessary, including those organisms associated with the product solution and the container and closure. It may be necessary to identify the most heat-resistant bioburden organisms.\n\nSpecifications for Bioburden Specifications (alert and action levels) for bioburden should be provided. A description should be included of the program for routinely monitoring bioburden to ensure that validated and established limits are not exceeded (e.g., frequency of analysis and methods used in bioburden screening). The methods provided should be specific.\n\nIdentification, Resistance, and Stability of Biological Indicators Information and data concerning the identification, resistance (D and Z values), and stability of biological indicators used in the biological validation of the cycle should be provided. If biological indicators are purchased from a commercial source, it may be necessary to corroborate the microbial count and resistance, and provide performance specifications.\n\nThe Resistance of the Biological Indicator Relative to That of Bioburden Studies characterizing the resistance of the biological indicator relative to that of bioburden may be necessary. Resistance in or on the product (i.e., in the product solution, or on the surface of container or closure parts or interfaces) should be determined as necessary. If spore carriers are used (e.g., spore strips), the resistance of spores on the carrier relative to that of directly inoculated product should be determined, if necessary.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]\n\nunits that have been exposed to the maximum sterilization cycle(s). If a product is exposed to more than one process, then exposure to the maximum cycle of all processes should be incorporated into the study design.\n3. Multiple Barriers Each barrier that separates areas of the drug product claimed to be sterile should be separately evaluated and validated.\n4. The Sensitivity of the Test The sensitivity of the experimental method used for container-closure integrity testing should be specified and provided.\n5. Integrity Over the Product Shelf Life Microbial integrity of the container-closure system should be demonstrated over the shelf life of the product. (See section V.A. of this guidance.)\n\nF. Bacterial Endotoxins Test and Method The bacterial endotoxins test used for the product should be described. The description should include qualification of the laboratory, inhibition and enhancement testing and results, determination of noninhibitory concentration and maximum valid dilution. For further information see the agency guidance entitled \"Guideline on Validation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test As An End-Product Endotoxin Test for Human And Animal Parenteral Drugs, Biological Products, and Medical Devices.\"\n6. Sterility Testing Methods and Release Criteria Sterility test methods should be described and should include the protocol for the selection of representative units during production. When test methods differ significantly from compendial test methods, a demonstration of the equivalency to the compendial method should be provided. Testing performed within barrier systems should be described, and information concerning validation of the barrier system may be necessary.\n\nH. Evidence of Formal, Written ProceduresSection 211.113(b) of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that written procedures, designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, be established and followed. Such procedures should include validation of any sterilization process. Therefore, evidence should be provided that there are formal, written procedures describing the elements listed above and that these procedures are followed. Such evidence may consist of SOP's, listing of SOP's, and protocols submitted as part of these elements.\n\n3 Other Terminal Sterilization Processes\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.4998395442962646", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix H Microbiology Considerations\n\nGenerally, FDA will RTR an ANDA if it contains certain deficiencies related to microbiology considerations.\n\nAn ANDA should contain all sterility assurance validation studies for terminally sterilized drug products and aseptically filled drug products, as described below67:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTerminally sterilized drug products\n\nValidation of production terminal sterilization process\n\nValidation of depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nAseptically filled drug products\n\nValidation of the sterilizing grade filters (bacterial retention studies)\n\nValidation of the sterilization of sterile bulk drug or product contact equipment, components, containers, and closures\n\nValidation of the depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of the aseptic filling process/line/room (media fills/process simulations)\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nIn addition, an ANDA should include at the time of submission, at minimum, summaries of validation studies.\n\nVI Bioequivalence and clinical deficiencies\n\nAs a general matter, ANDA applicants should refer to FDA's \"Product Specific Recommendations for Generic Drug Development\" website for Bioequivalence (BE) guidances regarding recommended in vivo and/or in vitro BE and other recommended studies.68\n\nFootnote 68: FDA\u2019s BE recommendations for specific products can be found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecompilianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm075207.htm.\n\nAppendix A Failed In Vivo BE Studies\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if only a failed in vivo BE study is submitted.69 FDA regulations require applicants to submit information on failed BE studies.70 Typically, a failed study is one that does not satisfy the 90% confidence interval (CI) criterion (e.g., falls outside of the 0.8-1.25 acceptance criterion limits) for either the area under curve (AUC) or peak plasma concentration (Cmax) parameter. If this occurs for highly variable drug products, the applicant may submit a study using a replicate study design and analyze data using a reference-scaled average (RSA) approach for the failed parameter. Applicants should refer to FDA's \"Product Specific Recommendations for Generic Drug Development\" website for BE guidances or submit BE guidance requests for proposed products to Generic Drugs@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFootnote 69: It is also recommended that a brief CMC summary of any failed studies be included in the Pharmaceutical Development report.\n\nFootnote 70: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(7)(i).\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA contains one or more in vivo studies that were not recommended in the BE guidance, without adequate justification.71 Adequate justification should include justification for an approach that deviates from FDA posted guidance, including data (Module 2.7 and Module 5) and appropriate references. Applicants should refer to FDA's \"Product Specific Recommendations for Generic Drug Development\" website for BE guidances or submit BE guidance requests for proposed products to Generic Drugs@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFootnote 71: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(7).\n\nFootnote 72: In such instances, bioequivalence is considered to be self-evident.\n\nFootnote 73: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(7).\n\nFootnote 74: BE tables can be found on FDA\u2019s Web site at the following location:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/Approv\n\nallApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM120957.pdf.\n\nQ1/Q2 Sameness Requirement for Consideration of an In Vivo BE Study Waiver\n\nCertain drug products may be eligible for a waiver from conducting in vivo BE studies typically required to support an ANDA. For example, in accordance with 21 CFR 320.22(b)(1), parenteral drug products, in addition to both ophthalmic and otic solutions, may be eligible for a waiver of BE studies, provided that their formulations are considered Q1/Q2 same as the RLD.72 If such a drug product is determined not to be Q1/Q2 same as the RLD, FDA will RTR the ANDA based on the determination that the drug product is ineligible for a waiver because of permissible formulation differences.73\n\nFootnote 73: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(7).\n\nFor ophthalmic solutions, it is critical to also complete and include the BE table Comparative Physicochemical Data of Ophthalmic Solution Drug Products74 in Module 2.7 of the ANDA submission to further support the waiver request. This table captures key information/data relevant to both the test product and the RLD. If this table is omitted, FDA will RTR the ANDA despite a determination that the test formulation is Q1/Q2 same as the RLD.75\n\nFootnote 75: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(7).\n\n4 Inadequate Dissolution Data (In Vitro Studies)\n\nFor any recommended dissolution study, it is critical that appropriate comparison data (i.e., test product and RLD) be provided.76 If there is evidence within the ANDA that the appropriate dissolution studies were not conducted or a supplemental study is omitted, FDA will RTR the ANDA.\n\nFootnote 76: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nThe BE guidances discussed in this section contain important details about the types of dissolution studies appropriate for the RLD and test products, along with information on waiver of an in vivo BE data requirement for any additional strengths for which approval is sought.77 In addition, these BE guidances may reference dissolution methods available through FDA's Web site that are specific to a particular drug product.78\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nOther suggested types of comparative (i.e. test product and RLD) supplemental dissolution studies include:\n\nAlcohol dose-dumping\n\nHalf-tablet dissolution for modified-release drug products with functional score marks79 performed for each strength of test and RLD in the recommended media, or quality control (QC) media if there is no recommendation (alcohol dose-dumping studies are not recommended for half-tablet dissolution studies)\n\nAny other product-specific dissolution study described in the BE recommendations for the relevant product\n\n5 Miscellaneous Factors\n\n5.0.1 Study Information BE Table80\n\nFootnote 80: A functional score mark enables delivery of a dose that is supported by RLD labeling.\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the Study Information BE table is incomplete.81 The Study Information BE table compiles important information about study type and site locations and should be placed in Module 2.7 of the ANDA (along with the other BE summary tables).\n\nApplicants should provide the requested information regarding sample storage and long-term storage. Receipt of the ANDA is also predicated on the following information that is captured in the table:\n\nFootnote 80: A copy of this BE table can be found on FDA\u2019s Web site at the following location:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/Approv\n\n5.0.2 Waiver of In Vivo BA or BE Studies for BCS Class I Drugs\n\nIf the applicant requests a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 1 BA/BE waiver, FDA will RTR the ANDA if any of the data needed to support such a waiver request are missing from the ANDA at the time of submission.82 Applicants should refer to FDA's guidance for industry Waiver of In Vivo Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Immediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Based on a Biopharmaceutics Classification System for details regarding waivers of any required in vivo bioavailability (BA) or BE studies for a BCS Class 1 drug substance.\n\nFootnote 82: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(7).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nOffice of Bioequivalence and Office of Pharmaceutical Quality Receipt Evaluations\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA, in certain cases, based on the recommendations of DBE, the Division of Clinical Review (DCR), and/or the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality. Deficiencies in these modules are generally associated with, but not limited to, various concerns with an in vivo BE or clinical endpoint BE study, or statistical data and/or design.\n\nvi.3.4 Drug-Device Combination Products\n\nOn a case-by-case basis and in consideration of preliminary evaluations performed by consultant offices, FDA will RTR an ANDA for a drug-device combination product if a device used to deliver the drug is not sufficiently similar to the device used to deliver the RLD. Any device used to deliver the drug should be similar enough to that used with/for the RLD so as to ensure, at a minimum, safe and proper administration of the product without the need for retraining by a health care professional and to ensure that its performance characteristics, operating principles, and critical design attributes will result in a product that will perform the same as the RLD under the conditions of use described in the labeling. In addition, the patient instructions in the labeling, as it concerns use of the device, should meet the same labeling requirement for ANDAs.83\n\nFootnote 83: Section 505(j)(2)(A)(v) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 314(a)(8)(iv).84 21 CFR 314.101(d)(3).\n\nvi.3.5 Missing Case Report Forms\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if a clinical study conducted does not contain copies of individual case report forms for patients enrolled in the study.84 Applicants should provide a random selection of at least 10% of all case report forms for any study that enrolls patients. Applicants should also include all case report forms for subjects removed from study analysis for any reason. In addition, applicants should provide copies of individual case report forms for each patient who died during a clinical study or who did not complete the study because of an adverse event, whether believed to be drug-related or not, including patients receiving reference drugs or placebo, consistent with 21 CFR 314.50(f)(2).\n\nFootnote 84: 21 CFR 314.101(d)(3).\n\nVII Dispute of a Refuse-to-Receive Decision\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDA Submissions -- Refuse-to-Receive Standards Rev.2 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.1291699409484863", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: #238\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nModified Release Veterinary Parenteral Dosage Forms: Development, Evaluation, and Establishment of Specifications\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance at any time.

These approaches are detailed in the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Guidance for Industry (GFI), \"Q8(R2) Pharmaceutical Development\" (International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH]) Q8(R2)) (November 2009).1 Product specifications are linked directly to the in vitro release test method.\n\nFootnote 1: https://www.cds.org/\n\nProduct in vitro drug release specifications provide a metric for confirming that the in vivo drug release characteristics will be consistent with the intended therapeutic objectives. Empirical (minimal) approaches base product specifications on batch data at the time of registration, and these specifications then serve as the primary means of product control. In this approach, the prognostic potential of the drug-release method is constrained by the limits of the information about which the specifications can be based. In contrast, the systematic (enhanced) quality-by-design (QbD) approach incorporates product specifications as a component of the overall quality-control (QC) strategy. The QbD approach establishes specifications based upon the design space.\n\nA greater understanding of the product and its manufacturing process may create a basis for flexible and innovative regulatory approaches. But the scope of that flexibility will depend, in part, on the relevant scientific knowledge provided in the registration application. It is the knowledge gained and submitted to the authorities that forms the basis for science- and risk-based submissions and regulatory evaluations.\n\n3 Scope\n\nThis document provides:\n\nSuggestions for development of an in vitro drug release test method\n\nA discussion of the components of a drug release method\n\nThe role of an in vivo/in vitro correlation (IVIVC) or an in vivo/in vitro relationship (IVIVR) in a product application. Throughout this document, we use the term \"IVIVC/R\" to denote text pertaining to IVIVC and/or IVIVR.\n\nMethods for establishing IVIVC/R for a parenteral product\n\nSuggestions for establishing clinically relevant in vitro drug release specifications\n\nMethods for using in vitro product specifications for setting expiry and for supporting batch release\n\nRecommendations for filing information for in vitro drug release methods and data as well as material for the Pharmaceutical Development Report, and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls technical section for modified-release parenteral dosage forms.\n\nThis guidance does not describe post-approval changes of in vitro methods or development of suitable correlation for oral modified release dosage forms and nanotechnology products.\n\nIV General Considerations for the Development of a Drug Release Method\n\nThe in vitro drug release test method should be established during the early phases of product development so that it can be used to characterize the preliminary formulations, the formulations used in the Target Animal Safety and Effectiveness studies,[20] and to provide the assessment of the stability lots. The establishment of product release specifications should be based upon in vitro performance of those lots used during the pivotal studies used to demonstrate drug product safety and effectiveness. However, a widening of the specifications may be deemed acceptable based upon additional in vivo and in vitro data gathered during product development.\n\nPrior to proceeding with development of the drug release method, the following information should be considered and discussed with CVM:\n\nFormulation development, including assessment of the need for an initial burst release (loading dose) and rate and duration of drug release\n\nAssessment of the excipient(s) or dosage form that may impact the rate and duration of drug release\n\nDevelopment of an in vitro test that adequately describes the formulation attributes\n\nEvaluation of the method as a QC test to support batch release at the initial time point and ensure product performance throughout expiry\n\nEvaluation of the impact of manufacturing process changes on product performance\n\nEvaluation of the impact of changes in supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and critical excipients\n\nSubstantiation of CMC-associated label claims (such as product drug release characteristics).\n\nV In vitro Drug Release Test Method Parameters:\n\nThe in vitro drug release method should be capable of identifying formulation differences that affect in vivo product performance. This necessitates that the method is sensitive to the rate limiting factor impacting in vivo drug release. [11] Method sensitivity can be confirmed during the formulation screening stage. Often, this evaluation compares the results provided across several in vitro release methods. Once a sponsor develops a discriminating system, a consistent set of testing conditions should be maintained across all formulations and manufacturing lots used during target animal safety and clinical effectiveness trials.\n\nIn most circumstances, the in vitro method should employ sink conditions to reflect the relationship between product formulation and the rate and extent of drug release. In those rare situations where sink conditions cannot be achieved, justification for an assay that does not achieve sink conditions should be submitted in a protocol or with the application.\n\nCVM recommends the following information to support the proposed drug release method and apparatus of choice:\n\nDescription of the apparatus used: United States Pharmacopeia (USP) chapters (<)711(>)iv or (<)724(>)v can be referenced if a sponsor uses one of the USP apparatus. If the sponsor selects a different apparatus, the description should include the vessel (shape, dimension, and its material, etc.), motor, shaft, collection basket or device, water bath or heating device, and how a sponsor performs sampling throughout the duration of the test.\n\nDescription of physical design and set up conditions of the apparatus. A picture of the equipment and set up with identification of the specific parts of the equipment is helpful. Include the dimensions and tolerances of the specific components and their related position to the whole assembly.\n\nCharacterization of temperature conditions of the vessel and how they can be maintained consistently during the run.\n\nJustification of apparatus suitability: 1. Determination of the apparatus suitability. This information should include conformance to the measurements (width, length, etc.) and specifications (degree of tolerance) of the specific components. 2. Performance validation and verification of the apparatus: 1. If the apparatus is a USP apparatus, follow the USP procedure as described in (<)711(>) or (<)724(>) to demonstrate the suitability of the apparatus.\n\nIf the apparatus is not described in the USP, information from the manufacturer can be used as a point of reference. 3. Acceptable performance of the apparatus assembly should be verified periodically and the conditions by which the apparatus is deemed acceptable for use should be described.\n\nDescription of the type of media and justification for its selection.\n6 Description of sample and standard preparation, including storage conditions and any precaution in handling and sampling techniques.\n7 Description of other assay parameters; i.e., temperatures, mix rates, duration of the test, degradation rate, release rate, sampling points and techniques, etc.\n\nDemonstration of sink conditions: Provide data that defines the volume of fluid necessary to insure that the concentration of drug in the medium at 100% release does not exceed one-third of the saturation concentration, where saturation concentration is defined by the maximum mg/mL of drug that can be solubilized in the release medium.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #238 Modified Release Veterinary Parenteral Dosage Forms- Development, Evaluation, and Establishment of Specifications \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.5763731002807617"], "As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Class III devices generally are those for which insufficient information exists to determine that general or special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

Examples of diagnostics include in vitro diagnostic reagents and test kits such as pregnancy test kits, and imaging systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n4 What is a premarket notification (510(k)) submission?\n\nA premarket notification, or 510(k), is submitted to FDA before a manufacturer proposes to market a medical device. If FDA agrees the new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device for which premarket approval is not required, the manufacturer may market it immediately. FDA does not require clinical data in most 510(k)s. However, if clinical data are necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence, the clinical study must comply with the IDE, IRB, and human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) regulations. See section 520(g) of the act and 21 CFR Parts 812, 56 and 50.\n\n5 What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n\nA premarket approval (PMA) application is the most stringent type of device marketing application for medical devices. FDA approves a PMA if it determines that the application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).\n\n6 Where can I find more information about 510(k)s and PMAs?\n\nAdditional information is available about these programs on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's website at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/.\n\n7 What is a humanitarian use device (HUD)?\n\nAn HUD is a device that is intended to benefit patients in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases or conditions that affect or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States per year. The Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) determines if a device meets specific requirements, including scientific rationale and population prevalence, for designation as a HUD.\n\n8 What is a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application?\n\nA Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application is similar to a PMA, but because a HUD is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA, an HDE application is not required to contain the results of scientifically valid clinical investigations demonstrating that the device is effective for its intended purpose. However, the HDE must contain sufficient information for FDA to determine that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment. Section 520(m)(2)(C). An approved HDE authorizes marketing of an HUD.\n\nUnder the statute, once the HDE is approved, the HDE holder is responsible for ensuring that the approved HUD is only administered at institutions that have an IRB constituted and acting pursuant to 21 CFR 56, including conducting continuing review of the use of the HUD. In addition, an HUD should be administered only if such use has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) located at the facility, or by a similarly constituted IRB that has agreed to oversee such use and to which the local IRB has deferred in a letter to the HDE holder. An HDE holder may wish to ensure that this happens by not shipping the HUD to the facility until it has received confirmation of IRB approval.\n\nNOTE: HUDs should not be used until AFTER the HDE applicant obtains approval of the HDE from FDA and the IRB approves its use. IRBs should ensure that HDE approval has been granted before approving the device for use at their institution.\n\n9 What are the responsibilities of the IRBs regarding HDEs?\n\nInitial review:\n\nInitial IRB approval should be performed at a convened IRB meeting. The IRB does not need to review and approve individual uses of an HUD, but rather the IRB may approve use of the device as it sees fit. That is, the IRB may approve use of the HUD without any further restrictions, under a protocol, or on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContinuing review:\n\nIRBs may approve the use of the device for a period of time, not to exceed one year. 21 CFR 56.109(f). In some higher risk cases, IRBs have approved HUDs for a specific number of patients and have required a summary report before approving the use in additional patients. Continuing review should follow the requirements found at 21 CFR 56, and may be conducted using the expedited review procedures (see 21 CFR 56.110) unless the IRB determines that full board review should be performed. The agency believes that the expedited review procedures are appropriate for continuing review since the initial review would have been performed by the full board and use of the HUD within its approved labeling does not constitute research.\n\n10 Is informed consent required when treating/diagnosing a patient with an HUD?\n\nThe act and the HDE regulations do not require informed consent. Because an HDE provides for marketing approval, use of the HUD does not constitute research or an investigation which would normally require consent from the study subjects. However, there is nothing in the law or regulations that prohibits a state or institution from requiring prospective informed consent, when feasible. In fact, most HDE holders have developed patient labeling that incorporates information that may be used to assist a patient in making an informed decision about the use of the device. For example, the patient labeling may contain a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of the HUD, as well as any procedures associated with the use of the device. The HUD labeling also states that the device is a humanitarian use device for which effectiveness for the labeled indication has not been demonstrated. See 21 CFR 814.104(b)(4)(ii).\n\nUnless it is an emergency, before an HUD is used off-label, the agency recommends that the HDE holder obtain FDA approval of the use following the compassionate use policy for unapproved devices. (See Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the \"IDE Policies and Procedures Guidance.\"2) If FDA approves the compassionate use request, the physician should ensure that the patient protection measures are addressed before the device is used and should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient. If the situation is life-threatening and there is not time to get FDA approval for the off-label use, FDA recommends that the emergency use procedures outlined in the above referenced guidance be followed.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance may be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\nSometimes a physician or HDE holder may develop a research protocol designed to collect safety and effectiveness data to support a PMA for the device. In that case, an IDE is not needed if the research is within the approved labeling; however, IRB approval for the investigational study must be obtained before the research may begin. Informed consent must also be obtained from the subjects participating in the study. If the research is for a new use, the IDE regulation must be followed. 21 CFR Parts 812, 50, and 56.\n\n11 What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n\nIn accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA's human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.1070761680603027", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.1 Premarket Approval Applications (PMA)\n\nPMA approval is required by FDA before devices that are class III25 can be legally marketed.26 PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to reasonably assure that the device or device-led combination product is safe and effective for its intended use(s).27 Sponsors should ensure that PMA applications for device-led combination products contain sufficient data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the combination product as a whole, including data regarding all constituent part(s). The PMA includes sections containing, among other things, technical data, non-clinical laboratory studies, and clinical investigations.28 Before approving or denying a PMA, the appropriate FDA advisory committee29 may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether FDA should approve the submission.30\n\nFootnote 25: Class III devices are devices (1) for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls and special controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and (2) which are purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury (see section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act).\n\n2.2.2 De Novo Classification Requests\n\nDevices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified or reclassified based on the criteria in section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act are automatically classified into class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, and may be classified into class I or class II under the De Novo classification process.\n\nIf a sponsor believes its product is appropriate for classification into class I31 or class II,32 it may submit a request for De Novo classification.33 If the sponsor demonstrates that the criteria in section 513(a)(1)(A) or (B) of the FD&C Act are met, FDA grants the request for De Novo classification and issues a written order classifying the specific product and product type in class I or class II. If the product is classified as class II, it is granted marketing authorization subject to general controls, as well as identified special controls which provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.34 Such a product may serve as a legally marketed (predicate)35 product for future 510(k) submissions. If the product cannot be classified as class I or II, the De Novo request is declined and the product remains in class III and subject to PMA approval.\n\nFootnote 31: Class I products are subject to a set of regulatory authorities called general controls (see section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). General controls include, but are not limited to, provisions that relate to establishment registration and listing, premarket notification, prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding, records and reports, and good manufacturing practices.\n\nFootnote 32: Class II products are products for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the product, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls necessary to provide such assurance (see section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Special controls are product type-specific and may include promulgation of performance standards, requirements for postmarket surveillance, patient registries, labeling, and performance testing and clinical/non-clinical data.\n\nFootnote 33: See section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 860, subpart D (86 FR 54826, October 5, 2021). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation)(October 2021).\n\nFootnote 34: Such special controls will generally be established through consultation and alignment with the non-lead center.\n\nFootnote 35: A legally marketed (predicate) device to which a new device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I, or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process (see 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)).\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nFootnote 37: See section 513(f)(2)(A)(ii) and (iv) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 38: For example, blood, gene therapies, or human cellular or tissue products.\n\nSpecial controls set forth criteria for class II products that are necessary to provide the assurance of safety and effectiveness to justify classification in class II. To be class II by being within the same type as the product that was the subject of the De Novo, future products must be found substantially equivalent and comply with general controls and applicable special controls for the product type; a failure to comply with special controls will cause the product to be class III and subject to PMA approval.36\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nA sponsor may request De Novo classification without submitting a 510(k) first; FDA may decline to undertake such request if FDA identifies a predicate product that could provide a reasonable basis for review of substantial equivalence, or if FDA determines either that the product submitted is not of low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls to mitigate the risks cannot be developed.37 Among other considerations, understanding of the biological product or drug constituent parts, including limitations of such understanding, need to be considered when determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway for such device-led combination products. Because certain products present unique concerns (such as, for certain biological products,38 considerations associated with infectious disease transmission and challenges associated with ensuring reproducibility of such biological products), management of such concerns should be considered in determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway.\n\nSee annex for illustrative examples on how these principles can be applied.\n\niii.1.3 Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions\n\nThe 510(k) review standard (substantial equivalence of a new product to a predicate product) differs from the PMA and De Novo review standards. The 510(k) review standard is comparative, whereas the PMA and De Novo review standards rely on an independent demonstration of safety and effectiveness. Nonetheless, the principles of safety and effectiveness underlie the substantial equivalence determination in every 510(k) review.\n\nThe standard for a determination of substantial equivalence in a 510(k) review is set out in section 513(i) of the FD&C Act. A product is substantially equivalent to a predicate product if it:\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product; and\n\nhas the same technological characteristics as the predicate product;\n\nor\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product;\n\nhas different technological characteristics39; and\n\nthe information submitted to FDA, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary, demonstrates that the product:\n\nFootnote 39: Different technological characteristics are defined as \u201csignificant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features\u201d from the predicate. Section 513(i)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.100(b)(2)(ii)(A).\n\ndoes not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product; and\n\ndemonstrates that the product is as safe and effective as the predicate product.40\n\nFootnote 40: See section 513(i)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 807.100(b). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n\nFDA considers the product's relative safety and effectiveness in the substantial equivalence determination, and safety and effectiveness considerations are also critical to the Agency's evaluation of compliance with any applicable special controls, all of which FDA has determined to be necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product type.\n\nThe following products cannot be cleared in a 510(k) submission:\n\nProduct with a new intended use as compared to the predicate product\n\nProduct with different technological characteristics than the predicate product if such differences raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product.41\n\nFootnote 41: Ibid.\n\nGenerally, a device that is not combined with a drug or biological product constituent part could not be successfully used as a predicate for a 510(k) for a device-led combination product. This is because the addition of the drug or biological product constituent part would likely result in a new intended use and/or constitute a different technological characteristic that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate. In addition, a product with a different active ingredient from a predicate would differ significantly in features such as design and materials, which would likely raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as well.42\n\nFootnote 42: In certain instances, it may be possible for special controls to specify multiple specific active ingredients or an active ingredient class, provided general and special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8952479362487793", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA\n\nStaff\n\nPremarket Approval Application\n\nModular Review\n\nDocument issued on: November 3, 2003\n\nThis document supersedes and replaces, \"A Modular Approach to PMA Review,\" dated January 29, 1998, and \"Guidance for the Medical Device Industry on PMA Shell Development and Modular Review,\" dated November 6, 1998.\n\nFor questions regarding this document, contact Thinh Nguyen (CDRH) at 240-276-4010 or by e-mail at thinh.nguyen@fda.hhs.gov.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nAppendix I Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide industry and FDA staff with information regarding the premarket approval application (PMA) modular review program and to outline the procedures for submitting or reviewing a modular PMA.\n\nThis guidance supersedes and replaces the documents entitled, \"A Modular Approach to PMA Review,\" dated January 29, 1998, and \"Guidance for the Medical Device Industry on PMA Shell Development and Modular Review,\" issued on November 6, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the 1998 Guidances).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nAppendix II Background\n\nIn a traditional PMA, the applicant submits all PMA data, as outlined in 21 CFR 814.20, at the same time, regardless of when testing is completed. FDA begins its review only upon receipt of all the required information In 1998, however, as part of CDRH's reengineering effort, FDA issued the above mentioned guidances. In these documents, FDA described a new policy whereby applicants could submit \"Modular PMAs.\" The goal of FDA's 1998 Guidances was to increase the efficiency of the PMA review process by allowing applicants to submit discrete sections (modules) of the PMA to FDA for review soon after completing the testing and analysis.\n\nFDA intends the modular review approach to provide a mechanism by which applicants may submit preclinical data and manufacturing information for review while still collecting, compiling, and analyzing the clinical data. Therefore, a modular PMA is a compilation of sections or \"modules\" submitted at different times that together become a complete application. Additionally, the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any deficiencies noted by FDA earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional PMA application.\n\nOn October 26, 2003, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUMFA), Pub lic Law 107-250 was enacted. Section 209 of MDUFMA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the act) to codify the modular review approach.1 In recognition that the agency would need to issue updated guidance to reflect the new statutory provision n, FDA requested comments on its modular PMA review program. On February 4, 2003, FDA published a Federal Register notice entitled, \"Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Establishment of a Public Docket (68 FR 5643)(hereinafter referred to as the MDUFMA Docket). In addition, FDA issued a guidance entitled, \"Assessing User Fees: PMA Supplement Definitions, Modular PMA Fees, BLA and Efficacy Supplement Definitions, Bundling Multiple Devices in a Single Application, and Fees for Combination Products.\"2 In the guidance, FDA asked for comments on the various topics discussed in the document, including modular review of PMAs.\n\nFootnote 1: Section 515(c) of the act, as amended by section 209 of MDUFMA.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance was issued on February 25, 2003 and can be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/1201.html (hereinafter referred to as the Assessing User Fees guidance.)\n\nSince 1998, FDA has gained considerable experience with modular PMA submissions. Based on FDA's experience prior to the enactment of MDUFMA and comments submitted to the MDUFMA Docket, FDA is issuing this guidance to replace the 1998 Guidances. These changes include:\n\nclarifying that modular review should be limited to original PMAs (i.e., modular review is not ordinarily appropriate for PMA supplements)\n\nmodifying the procedures for preparing and submitting a modular PMA\n\nexplaining the significance of timing for submission of the modules\n\nrevising the sample shell and specifying the expected content of the modules\n\nsuggesting limitations to the total number of modules that should be submitted.\n\nThe agency expects these changes to: 1) help clarify which PMAs are appropriate for modular review, 2) simplify submission procedures, and 3) improve the efficiency of FDA's review. Additionally, we have added guidance addressing user fee payment procedures for modular PMAs.\n\nThe Least Burdensome Approach\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarket Approval Application Modular Review Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.24974533915519714", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA and Industry Actions on\n\nPremarket Approval Applications\n\n(PMAs): Effect on FDA Review\n\nClock and Goals\n\nGuidance for Industry and\n\nFood and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on October 3, 2022.\n\nDocument originally issued on October 8, 2003.\n\nThis document supersedes FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs): Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals\n\nissued October 2, 2017.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Regulatory Programs/Division of Submission Support/PMA, HDE, Q-Submission, and Device Tracking Lifecycle Team at 301-796-5640, or by email at\n\n(\\underline{\\text{\\small{OPEQSubmissionSupport}}})_a_fda.hhs.gov.

The additional funds obtained from user fees will enable FDA, with the cooperation of industry, to improve the device review process to meet certain performance goals and implement improvements for the medical device review process.\n\nFootnote 1: See Title II of the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-180).\n\nPerformance goals were negotiated and agreed to under MDUFA V for PMAs received in FY 2023-2027. These performance goals and process improvements are outlined in the letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Congress2 (MDUFA V Commitment Letter) and are further described below.\n\nFootnote 2: See 168 CONG. REC. S5194-S5203 (daily ed. September 28, 2022) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization). The MDUFA V Commitment Letter is also available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/158308/download.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThis guidance document describes:\n\nthe different FDA actions that may be taken on premarket approval applications (PMAs);\n\n2027); and\n\nthe different industry actions that may be taken on PMAs.\n\nIII. FDA Actions\n\nThe PMA regulation outlines the various actions FDA may take on an original PMA or PMA supplement during the course of our review.3 For original PMAs, panel-track supplements, and 180-day supplements,4 the following responses are considered FDA actions:\n\nFootnote 3: See 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart C.\n\nFootnote 4: For more detailed information, see FDA\u2019s guidance document, \u201cUser Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and Device Biologics Licences Applications,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/user-fees-and-refunds-premarket-approval-applications-and-device-biologics-license-applications or the guidance document entitled, \u201cModifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process.\n\napproval order;\n\napprovable letter;\n\nmajor deficiency letter;\n\nnot approvable letter; and\n\ndenial order.\n\nFor real-time supplements, all of the above responses apply with the exception of a major deficiency letter.\n\nFurthermore, of these FDA actions, all but a major deficiency letter are a \"MDUFA decision\" under FDA's commitment letters and are measured against a MDUFA IV/V goal. These FDA actions are described below.\n\nAppendix A Approval Order\n\nFDA will issue an approval order (letter) informing the applicant that the PMA is approved and that the applicant may begin commercial distribution of the device in accordance with any prescribed conditions of approval after we have completed our review and:\n\nnone of the reasons listed in 21 CFR 814.45 for denying approval applies;\n\nthere is reasonable assurance the device is safe and effective (using the criteria provided in 21 CFR 860.7) for its intended use as prescribed in the product labeling; and\n\nthe device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls were found to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation (21 CFR Part 820).\n\nAn approval order shuts off the review clock, marks the end of FDA review, and is considered a final action.\n\nAppendix B Approvable Letter\n\nFDA will issue an approvable letter informing the applicant that we have completed our review of the application and determined that there needs to be:\n\nresolution of minor deficiencies,5 which are identified in the approvable letter (21CFR 814.44(e)); and/or Footnote 5: Minor deficiencies may include, for example, clarifications of previously submitted information, revisions to the labeling, and revisions/development of a post approval study protocol.\n\ncompletion of an FDA inspection that finds the manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls in compliance with the Quality System (QS) regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, and, if applicable, verifies records pertinent to the PMA as per 21 CFR 814.44(e)(1)(iii). When this is the case, the approvable letter states that the device is \"approvable pending GMP inspection.\"\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable letter pending resolution of minor deficiencies, we stop the review clock and place the application on hold. When FDA receives a complete response to an approvable letter, we will resume the clock with a new FDA response timeframe to reach a final decision. FDA will issue a decision within 60 calendar days of the sponsor's response to the approvable letter, as resources permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative review timelines and statutory obligations.\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable pending GMP inspection letter, we stop the review clock. Once FDA determines that the device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls arefound to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation, 21 CFR part 820, we will issue an approval order.\n\nAppendix C Major Deficiency Letter\n\nFDA will issue a major deficiency letter6 informing the applicant that the PMA lacks significant information necessary for FDA to complete our review and requests the applicant to amend the application to provide the necessary information regarding the device (21 CFR 814.37(b)), such as:\n\nFootnote 6: For additional information about deficiencies, see FDA\u2019s guidance document, \u201cDeveloping and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/developing-and-responding-deficiencies-accordance-least-burdensome-provisions.\n\na detailed re-analysis of previously submitted data (e.g., alternative statistical method);\n\nadditional test data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the device (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, biocompatibility, reliability, software, labeling, animal testing, sensitivity and specificity in a certain population);\n\nscientific rationale for test data critical to determining reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device provided in the submission; or\n\nnew validation data and analyses (e.g., due to device modifications made during the course of the PMA review).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs)- Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4345400631427765", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: In requesting additional information with respect to a premarket approval application (PMA), \"the Secretary shall consider the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.\"6 Footnote 5: Section 515(c)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\n\"[T]he Secretary shall consider the role of postmarket information in determining the least burdensome means of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.\"7 Footnote 7: Section 515(c)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe term \"necessary\" in the least burdensome provisions means the \"minimum required information\" that would support a determination of substantial equivalence or a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.8 Footnote 8: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iii), 513(i)(1)(D)(ii), and 515(c)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe least burdensome provisions do not change the standards for premarket approval or substantial equivalence.9 Footnote 9: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iv), 513(i)(1)(D)(iii), and 515(c)(5)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA issued least burdensome guidance documents after the enactment of FDAMA. \"Suggested Format for Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions of FDAMA\" (\"Deficiencies Guidance\") was issued on November 2, 2000. In that guidance document, FDA recommended that its staff use a specific format for requests for additional information needed to make a decision on a medical device marketing submission (often called \"deficiencies\" or \"deficiency letters\") to be in accordance with least burdensome principles. This format was intended to directly connect FDA requests to applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for a decision and optimize the time and effort of both industry and FDA. That guidance document also included a recommended format for industry responses to FDA deficiencies.\n\nWith the enactment of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (Public Law 115-52, SSSS 201-210) (MDUFA IV), FDA committed to updating the Deficiencies Guidance. Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions was issued on September 29, 2017.10 The Deficiencies Guidance was updated to recommend that all deficiency letters include a statement regarding the basis for each deficiency and provides details regarding supervisory review, major/minor deficiencies, additional considerations, and prioritization of deficiencies.\n\nFootnote 10: https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM073680.\n\n\"The Least Burdensome Provisions of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997: Concept and Principles\" was issued on October 4, 2002 (\"2002 Least Burdensome Guidance\"). The guidance stated that, while the least burdensome provisions from FDAMA applied to PMA and 510(k) submissions, FDA believed that least burdensome principles should be implemented for all medical device premarket regulatory activities. The document also defined the term \"least burdensome\" and included suggested approaches for industry and FDA staff to use least burdensome principles in PMA and 510(k) review, including focusing on the statutory and regulatory criteria for marketing authorization. The guidance also described general applications of least burdensome approaches to activities such as postmarket controls, and recommendations for how the Agency should communicate requests for additional information to industry.\n\nThis guidance document replaces the 2002 Least Burdensome Guidance. The statutory updates in FDASIA and the Cures Act clarified the original least burdensome provisions and further recognized the role of postmarket activities as they relate to premarket decisions. FDA believes,as a matter of policy, that least burdensome principles should be consistently and widely applied to all medical device regulatory activities in the premarket and postmarket settings to remove or reduce unnecessary burdens so that patients can have earlier and continued access to high quality, safe and effective devices. The Agency is applying tools in our implementation of these principles, such as regular internal training on least burdensome principles.\n\nThis guidance, therefore, reflects FDA's belief that least burdensome principles should be applied throughout the medical device total product lifecycle. The least burdensome concept remains the same in that the principles are based on sound science, the intent of the law, the use of alternative approaches, and the efficient use of resources to effectively address regulatory issues. We have provided contemporary examples for both premarket and postmarket settings to demonstrate approaches that FDA and industry can take to ensure that least burdensome principles are implemented for all device-related applications and interactions with FDA.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThe least burdensome concept and this guidance apply to all products that meet the statutory definition of a device,11 including device constituent parts of combination products. The policy in this guidance applies to all activities (including premarket and postmarket actions) pertaining to the regulation of medical devices. The policy in this guidance applies, but is not limited, to:\n\nFootnote 11: Section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nPremarket submissions, including premarket approval applications (PMAs), premarket notifications (510(k) submissions), De Novo classification requests, humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications, and investigational device exemption (IDE) applications\n\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver by Applications\n\nAdditional Information and Major Deficiency Letters\n\nQ-Submissions, including Pre-Submissions\n\nInformal or interactive inquiries regarding device development\n\nPanel review and recommendations\n\nPostmarket surveillance, including Medical Device Reports (MDRs) and Post-Approval Studies\n\nReclassifications and 510(k) exemptions\n\nGuidance documents and their application\n\nCompliance-related interactions* Regulation development\n\nIV Guiding Principles\n\nFDA defines least burdensome to be the minimum amount of information necessary to adequately address a relevant regulatory question or issue through the most efficient manner at the right time (e.g., need to know versus nice to know). Our least burdensome definition and principles do not change the applicable statutory and regulatory standards, such as the device approval or clearance standards, nor the applicable requirements, including premarket submission content requirements and the requirement for valid scientific evidence.12\n\nFootnote 12: Sections 513(i) and 515 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E, Parts 812 and 814, and 860.7(c).\n\nNotwithstanding references to what industry should do, our guiding principles explain FDA's commitments for least burdensome device review. FDA intends to, and industry should, apply the following guiding principles when taking a least burdensome approach to a particular question or issue at any point in the total product lifecycle:\n\nFDA intends to request the minimum information necessary to adequately address the regulatory question or issue at hand.\n\nIndustry should submit material, including premarket submissions, to FDA that are least burdensome for FDA to review. * Industry should submit well-organized, clear, and concise information. * Industry should not submit information unrelated to the regulatory decision to FDA. * Industry should reference applicable FDA guidance documents where FDA recommendations were considered.\n\nFDA intends to use the most efficient means to resolve regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to use all reasonable measures to streamline processes and policies, as well as render regulatory decisions within appropriate timeframes, such as MDUFA performance goals. * FDA intends to routinely use both formal and informal interactive approaches, whenever possible, to resolve questions and issues. * FDA intends to, and industry should, use reasonable, tailored approaches that have been adapted to individual circumstances and needs to address regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to take appropriate consideration of the time and resource implications of its requests.\n\nThe right information should be provided at the right time (e.g., just-in-time data collection) to address the right questions. * FDA intends to, and industry should, consider the use of postmarket data collection to reduce premarket data collection whenever appropriate and feasible.\n\nRegulatory approaches should be designed to fit the technology, taking into account its unique innovation cycles, evidence generation needs, and timely patient access.\n\nFDA intends to leverage data from other countries and decisions by, or on behalf of, other national medical device regulatory authorities to the extent appropriate and feasible.\n\nFDA intends to apply least burdensome principles in international medical device convergence and harmonization efforts. * FDA intends to actively engage in the development, recognition, and use of voluntary consensus standards published by international and other standards development organizations.\n\nProviding excellent customer service is critical to successfully applying least burdensome principles. FDA strives for clear and concise communication of its requests, expectations, processes, policies, and decisions, as well as the rationale behind them. Industry can help us apply least burdensome principles by providing FDA with clear and concise requests, premarket submissions, and responses, along with their rationales. Excellent customer service and open lines of communication between FDA and its customers will help to provide regulatory outcomes that best serve patients.\n\nV Applications of Least Burdensome Principles\n--------------------\nContext title: The Least Burdensome Provisions- Concept and Principles Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.48346734046936035", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 23: See section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(1)(C)).\n\nFootnote 24: See sections 513(a)(2), 515(d)(1)(A), and 515(d)(2)(A)-(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(2), 360c(d)(1)(A) and (d)(2)(A)-(B)); see also 21 CFR 860.7(b), (d), and (e).\n\nFootnote 25: Section 513(a)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(3)(A)).\n\nFor information regarding PMAs, see FDA's guidance entitled \"Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,\" dated August 24, 2016.

Additionally, the guidance document entitled \"Acceptance and Filing Reviews for Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs); Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\" dated January 30, 2018, may provide useful information to manufacturers when preparing PMAs. Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulation andguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm313368.pdf.\n\n4 Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)\n\nAn HDE provides a regulatory path for devices that are intended to benefit patients with rare diseases or conditions. To be eligible for an HDE, a device must first be designated as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD).26 Additional information about the HUD designation process can be found in the draft guidance document entitled \"Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program; Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\" dated June 13, 2018,\"27 available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm389275.pdf.\n\nFDA understands that applicants may have questions prior to submitting a premarket application. We have established a structured process for managing the various types of requests for feedback prior to a premarket submission, referred to as \"Q-Submissions.\" FDA has issued guidance that provides an overview of the mechanisms available toapplicants through which they can request feedback from FDA regarding potential or planned medical device IDE applications or other premarket submissions, such as PMA applications, HDE applications, De Novo requests, 510(k)s, and BLAs.28\n\nFootnote 28: See Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff: Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff, dated September 29, 2017, available at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm311176.pdf.\n\nIV Combination Products\n\nConsistent with section 503(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, added by the Cures Act, and the Agency's approach to simplifying and streamlining the regulatory requirements for combination products in general, single entity combination products are generally reviewed under a single application.29 Devices intended for use with a specific RMAT may, together with the RMAT, be considered to comprise a biologic-led combination product and be evaluated for marketing under a BLA in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), with consulting review by other center(s) as appropriate.30\n\nFootnote 29: Section 503(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(g)(1)(B)) provides that FDA shall review combination products in a single application, whenever appropriate. Note that under section 503(g)(6) of the FD&C Act, also added by the Cures Act, a sponsor may choose to submit separate applications for the constituent parts of a combination product, unless FDA determines that a single application is necessary.\n\nFootnote 30: See SMG 4101: Inter-Center Consult Request Process, June 2018, available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/StaffManualGuides/UCM283569.pdf.\n\nSome devices that can be used with approved RMATs may be evaluated independently using premarket submissions pathways identified in section III.B of this guidance. Examples may include some devices used in recovery (e.g., surgical tools, syringes, apheresis collection devices), or delivery (e.g., syringe, catheter). When a separate premarket application for a device to be used with an RMAT is appropriate, FDA will apply the least burdensome provisions of the FD&C Act as noted above to determine the \"minimum required information\" necessary for marketing authorization of that device.\n\nIn some instances, the device constituent part of an RMAT that is a combination product may be separately packaged. Separate marketing applications for each product may be appropriate, particularly, for example, if the delivery device may ultimately be labeled for use with multiple RMATs that have similar characteristics and administration requirements. In instances where there are separate applications for the RMAT(s) and device(s), fulfillment of regulatory requirements may be simplified or streamlined to reduce or avoid redundancy. For example, when appropriate and legally permissible, clinical or performance data generated in association with studies of one product may be submitted to support certain aspects of the approval or clearance of other, related product applications. It may also be possible for one regulatory submission to cross-reference existing performance data in another regulatory submission when available and when such reference is permissible. FDA intends to apply the least burdensome concept and principles in the guidance entitled, \"The Least Burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\" datedFootnote 20: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nFootnote 21: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFebruary 5, 2019,31 in determining the data and information necessary to support marketing authorization for the device for its intended use. FDA intends to apply these least burdensome concept and principles in the manner described regardless of how the device is presented for review, e.g., under a standalone application for more general use; or a constituent part, reviewed under a separate device application, of an RMAT that is a combination product; or under a single application for a combination product as a whole.\n\nFootnote 31: The draft guidance is available at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nV Factors to Consider for when a device may be intended for use with only one particular type of cell-based RMAT or with more than one type of cell-based RMAT\n\nRMAT designation is granted for a specific therapeutic product and specific intended uses.\n\nRMATs may represent a highly diverse group of products with distinct biological and physical characteristics. These characteristics, along with other factors such as target patient population (e.g., adult vs pediatric), intended use and conditions for use must be considered when determining which device, or devices, may be suitable for use with a specified RMAT or type of RMAT. These same factors will influence when a device may be limited to a specific intended use with only one particular cell-based RMAT or type of cell-based RMAT.\n\nRMATs are likely to differ with regard to characteristics that can impact the way they interact with different devices, which may affect the RMAT's safety and effectiveness. In the case of cellular products that are RMATs, including cellular products that are constituent parts of combination products, the interaction between cells and a device can have an impact on critical characteristics, such as cell viability, differentiation potential, activation state and ability to respond to stimuli after administration. Further, differences in physical characteristics such as cell size and sensitivity to shearing forces can directly impact the potential utility of a given device with a specific RMAT or type of RMAT. For example, it may not be possible to use a small bore catheter or pen/jet injector to deliver an RMAT that contains a large delicate cell type because the shearing forces may negatively impact cell viability. In contrast, an RMAT that contains a smaller, more robust cell type may require the use of a small bore catheter to facilitate delivery to a specific tissue site, but have special requirements to prevent the cells from adsorbing to the interior catheter surface or to each other, resulting in occlusion of the tip. Such factors along with the demonstrated performance will influence whether the device can obtain marketing authorization for a broader use or should be limited to use with a specific RMAT(s).\n\nBecause cellular products can possess extremely variable sensitivities to physical and chemical stimuli, it may be necessary to repeat testing to assess interactions of each new device-RMAT combination. To leverage compatibility data for a different device-RMAT combination, a detailed and specific scientific rationale for the applicability of this data would be needed. Sufficient compatibility data should be provided to the Agency prior to initiation of clinical trials.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Evaluation of Devices Used with Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9399811029434204"], "Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nCharacterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates and Other Biological Materials Used in the Production of Viral Vaccines for Infectious Disease Indications\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nWe, FDA, are providing you, manufacturers of viral vaccines, guidance for the characterization and qualification of cell substrates, viral seeds, and other biological materials used for the production of viral vaccines for human use.\n\nThis guidance applies to the development of viral vaccines for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases that are regulated by the Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR) of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nCell substrates are cells used to produce vaccines. The scope of this guidance document is limited to cell substrates of human or animal (including insect) origin and does not cover characterization of unicellular organisms, such as bacteria or yeast. In this document, cell substrates are categorized as primary (cells, including eggs, derived directly from an animal source and that are not stored as cell banks), diploid (cells with a normal or near-normal karyotype and that are stored as cell banks prior to use in vaccine manufacture), or continuous (cells that are immortal and do not undergo senescence). This guidance also applies to the characterization and qualification of viral seeds and other biological materials (including vaccine intermediates) used in vaccine manufacture.\n\nThis guidance finalizes the draft guidance entitled \"Guidance for Industry: Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates and Other Biological Starting Materials Used in the Production of Viral Vaccines for the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases,\" dated September 2006 (71 FR 57547). In addition, this document replaces the information pertaining to viral vaccines for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases that we provided in the document entitled \"Points to Consider in the Characterization of Cell Lines Used to Produce\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nBiologicals,\" dated 1993 (Ref. 1). This document also supplements the recommendations on the production of viral vaccines for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, provided in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) documents Q5A and Q5D (Refs. 2 and 3, respectively). For the production of biological products not covered under this guidance, we recommend that you refer to the \"Points to Consider in the Characterization of Cell Lines Used to Produce Biologicals,\" dated 1993 (Ref. 1).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in a guidance document means that something is recommended, but not required.\n\nII Definition\n\nFor the purpose of this document, viral vaccines are a heterogeneous class of preventive, and in some cases, therapeutic medicinal products that when administered are intended to elicit immune responses that could prevent and/or lessen the severity of one or more infectious diseases. These products include live attenuated preparations of viruses, inactivated (killed) whole or subunit virions, purified recombinant proteins, synthetic antigens, or live viral vectors expressing specific heterologous vaccine antigens. Therapeutic vaccines for non-infectious diseases (e.g., certain cancer vaccines) and monoclonal antibodies used as immunogens (e.g., anti-idiotypic antibodies) are not considered here. A glossary defining scientific terms in this guidance is located in Section V below.\n\nIII Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates, Viral Seeds, Biological Raw Materials and Vaccine Intermediates\n\nSelection of a cell substrate influences the safety and purity of the biological product manufactured in it. The evaluation (e.g., the particular tests and methodologies chosen) should be specifically tailored to the cell substrate and vaccine product to be developed to assure vaccine safety and purity. FDA recognizes that technology in this area is evolving. This section describes general parameters to be considered in the characterization of cell substrates, viral seeds, biological starting materials and vaccine intermediates. To maximize the value of the recommendations in this document, it is important that you perform each test at the stage of production at which contamination is most likely to be detected.\n\nTests to characterize and qualify cell substrates, biological materials, vaccine seeds, and vaccine intermediates are described in Section IV.\n\n1 Product-Specific Parameters Influencing Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates\n\n1 Vaccine Purity\n\nThe regulations, in 21 CFR 610.13, state in part that \"Products shall be free of extraneous material except that which is unavoidable in the manufacturing process described in the approved biologics license application.\" In 21 CFR 600.3(r), purity is defined as the \"relative freedom from extraneous matter in the finished product, whether or not harmful to the recipient or deleterious to the product.\"\n\nLive attenuated viruses, whole inactivated virions, or virus-like particles often cannot be purified as rigorously as viral subunit vaccines; as a consequence, the potential for contamination is greater than that of subunit vaccines. Generation of live viral vaccines often involves cell disruption, which may add cellular components to the vaccine bulk. In addition, such vaccines often are minimally purified and are not subjected to inactivation steps. Comprehensive testing and qualification of the biological starting materials and lot-by-lot testing for adventitious agents are particularly important because it is not possible for a manufacturer of live viral vaccines to validate the process for clearance of adventitious agents.\n\nIn contrast, for more highly purified products where viral clearance can be demonstrated during downstream processing, you can place more reliance on process validation (Ref. 2). For inactivated vaccines, the concern is that the process used to inactivate the vaccine virus may not inactivate all adventitious agents potentially present (as occurred with early inactivated poliovirus vaccines [Ref. 4]). Therefore, you should validate your process for inactivation of adventitious agents using different model viruses (Ref. 2). The choice of tests and the stages at which the tests are applied will depend on your inactivation process. The degree of viral clearance that is feasible may influence the sensitivity of the testing you should perform to demonstrate the absence of contaminants in your product.\n\nIf a viral vaccine seed was exposed to a known adventitious agent or if the passage history of a virus seed is unclear, you should purify the viral seed (e.g., by molecular cloning, serial passage in medium containing neutralizing antibody directed against the adventitious agent, or plaque purification). If your purification method is demonstrated to be capable of removing all adventitious agents from a viral seed to within an acceptable safety margin, this approach could be used to qualify a seed. If you are planning to perform seed purification, you should discuss your proposed methodology and its validation with us as early as is feasible.\n\n2 Potential Sources of Contamination\n\nIt is important that you identify and examine all potential sources of contamination of your product. For example, a viral seed could be exposed to the following potential sources of contamination: the person or animal from which it was isolated; the cells and raw materials (e.g., serum or trypsin) used in its isolation and attenuation; materials used in banking and propagation of cells for viral seed growth; and other materials used during production and filling of the seed. You should also consider the species of origin of your cell substrates, viral seeds, and other biological starting materials in selecting your tests to ensure the absence of contaminants. Furthermore, you should consider any infectious viruses (including those that infect nonhuman species) as potential contaminants if there is the possibility of contact with your product or cell substrate at any time during development or production. Retrovirus may be either endogeneous (i.e., encoded by the cell substrate genome) or exogenously acquired. Retrovirus testing should address the possibility that either type of retrovirus could contaminate a product. Finally, you should consider the possibility of contamination from unusual sources, as exemplified by the reported presence of minute virus of mice (MVM) in some lots of recombinant proteins (Ref. 5). The susceptibility of the cell substrate to infection by agents of potential concern can influence the tests needed to assure absence of contamination.\n\nUse of qualified raw materials can reduce the risk of introducing adventitious agents. For example, inactivation of viruses by irradiation of serum could provide additional assurance regarding the purity of the final product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates and Other Biological Materials Used in the Production of Viral Vaccines for Infectious Disease Indications Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.220965385437012", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: Chapter 5 Manufacturing Biological Intermediates and Biological Drug Substances Using Spore-Forming Microorganisms\n\nAdditional copies of this guidance are available from the Office of Communication, Training and Manufacturers Assistance (HFM-40), 1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852-1448, or by calling 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, or from the Internet at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.htm.\n\nFor questions on the content of this guidance, contact Cynthia Kelley at 301-827-0636 or John\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nSeptember 2007\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI INTRODUCTION................................................................................................................................................................**\n\nII: SCOPE................................................................................................**\n\nIII: BACKGROUND................................................................................**\n\nIV: MANUFACTURING WITH SPORE-FORMERS IN A SEPARATE DEDICATED BUILDING................................................**\n\nA.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe former regulations at 21 CFR 600.11(e)(3) (SS 600.11(e)(3)) required that all work with spore-bearing microorganisms (spore-formers) be conducted in an entirely separate building, or in a completely walled-off portion of a multiproduct building. This isolated building had to be dedicated exclusively for the manufacturing or storage of spore-formers. Previously, areas in a multiproduct building used for manufacturing with spore-formers were required to be constructed to prevent cross-contamination of other areas, and were required to include entrances that were separate and independent from the remainder of the facility. All equipment used for manufacturing spore-formers was to be permanently identified and reserved exclusively for use with those microorganisms. Any materials destined for further manufacture were to be removed from this area only under conditions that prevented the introduction of spores into other manufacturing areas.\n\nWe, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), modified the regulatory requirements for the manufacturing of biological products with spore-formers to allow greater manufacturing flexibility. Under the revised regulation1 we no longer require the use of permanently dedicated buildings and equipment for spore-formers, if certain controls and precautions are applied. We recognize that advances in facility, system, equipment design, testing, and sterilization technologies have increased the ability of manufacturers to control and analyze the manufacture of biological products. As industry has gained experience with these new technologies, we found that manufacturers could evaluate aspects of a biological product's safety and purity with testing. The use of appropriate procedural controls, validated processes, and enhanced testing capability provide the manufacturer with a degree of confidence that their biological productachieves the expected levels of safety and purity. Areas of special concern, such as process containment, contamination with pathogenic and/or toxic agents, sterilization, and disinfection can be addressed using currently available procedures and processes.\n\nWe recognize that spore-formers are currently used in manufacturing processes and there will likely be a need to use them in the immediate future. However, for the production of future biological products, manufacturers are encouraged to identify alternatives to the use of spore-forming microorganisms whenever possible. Such alternatives could include the use of sporulation deficient strains, or recombinant proteins expressed in nonspore-forming microorganisms. We anticipate that certain second-generation vaccines, including those against anthrax, botulism, and tetanus will likely contain recombinant proteins. The revised regulation uses the term \"spore-forming\" microorganisms to describe organisms that are capable of spore production. The term \"spore-bearing\" microorganism, which was used in the earlier regulation, is not used because the term spore-forming microorganism is the more commonly accepted description of this class of microorganisms. For the purposes of this guidance, the term spore-forming microorganism (or \"spore-former\") includes both the spore and vegetative forms of the organism.\n\nThis guidance document finalizes the draft guidance entitled \"Guidance for Industry: Manufacturing Biological Drug Substances, Intermediates, or Products Using Spore-Forming Microorganisms\" dated February 2005 (February 24, 2005; 70 FR 9084).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance describes the agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide to you, manufacturers of biological intermediates and biological drug substances using spore-forming microorganisms, guidance in response to changes made to SS 600.11(e)(3). The revised regulation describes the requirements for manufacturing using spore-forming microorganisms and allows manufacturers greater flexibility than under the prior regulation. We are limiting the scope of this guidance to biological intermediates and biological drug substances as spore-formers should not be present in the finished dosage form (biological drug product). Once the biological intermediates or biological drug substances have been separated from the viable spore-forming microorganism, the concern for cross-contamination diminishes. We recommend that you establish a distinct crossover point in the separation process.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Manufacturing Biological Intermediates and Biological Drug Substances Using Spore-Forming Microorganisms \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.270751953125", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance document finalizes the draft guidance entitled \"Guidance for Industry: Manufacturing Biological Drug Substances, Intermediates, or Products Using Spore-Forming Microorganisms\" dated February 2005 (February 24, 2005; 70 FR 9084).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.

Once the biological intermediates or biological drug substances have been separated from the viable spore-forming microorganism, the concern for cross-contamination diminishes. We recommend that you establish a distinct crossover point in the separation process.\n\nThis guidance applies to biological manufacturing processes utilizing spore-forming microorganisms regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act), the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and the applicable regulations in 21 CFR Parts 600 through 680. Section 501(a)(2)(b) of the Act requires that the methods used in, or the facilities or controlsused for, the manufacture, processing, packing or holding of drugs, including biological intermediates and biological drug substances, conform to or are operated and administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of the Act as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is represented to possess.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to allergenic and fungi source material, in vitro diagnostics, or therapeutics. Additionally, this guidance does not apply to spore-forming microorganisms used for the supplemental sterilization procedure control test described in SS 600.11(e)(2).\n\nWhen the spore-former used in the manufacturing process is a pathogen or is potentially pathogenic, the stricter requirements related to equipment and supplies between SS 600.11(e)(5) and revised SS 600.11(e)(3) must be applied.\n\n3 Background\n\nSpore-formers are used in the production of certain biological products. Biological intermediates or biological drug substances derived from spore-formers may be used as source material for further manufacture into final biological drug products, such as vaccines. Bacteria produce spores as a means to survive adverse environmental conditions. In general, spores show enhanced resistance over bacteria to high temperatures, freezing, dryness, antibacterial agents, radiation, and toxic chemicals. Under favorable conditions, spores can germinate into actively growing vegetative bacterial cells. Some of these spore-formers are human pathogens and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to their unique survival properties, spore-formers pose great challenges to manufacturers. In order to ensure the safety of a product manufactured in a facility in which spore-formers are present, these microorganisms must be kept under stringent control in order to avoid the release of spores into the manufacturing area where they have the potential to cross-contaminate other products and areas. (SS 600.11(e)(3)(i)).\n\nManufacturing with spore-formers requires varying levels of control depending on the characteristics (e.g., virulence toward humans) of the microorganism that is utilized in a manufacturing process. The level of confidence a specific process provides for safety and purity may also be a factor in deciding the level of manufacturing control necessary. You must institute the appropriate controls in the manufacturing facility, associated equipment, and manufacturing procedures to avoid contamination. (SSSS 600.11(a), 600.11(e)(3)(i), 600.11(e)(5)). The recommendations described in this guidance are intended for manufacturing with the type of spore-formers that are currently used by the regulated industry and included in the scope of this guidance. Any atypical or novel spore-formers may require specific controls that are unique for that particular microorganism.\n\nPrevention of spore contamination can be achieved by using a separate dedicated building or by using process containment if manufacturing is conducted in a multiproduct manufacturing building. Containment is established by facility design and/or the use of procedures and equipment that prevent the release of spores into adjacent areas. (SS 600.11(e)(3)).\n\nIV Manufacturing with spore-formers in a separate dedicated building\n\nThis section applies if you choose to use a separate dedicated building configuration for manufacturing with spore-formers. Although you are no longer required to use this type of configuration, if you do so, you must follow the applicable requirements in SS 600.11(e)(3)(i) to avoid having to satisfy the process containment requirements in subsection (e)(3)(ii). This section of the guidance document reiterates the requirements in subsection (e)(3)(i) applicable to separate dedicated buildings, and provides additional recommendations for using this configuration.\n\nPhysical Establishment and Equipment\n\nThe use of a separate dedicated building for manufacturing processes involving spore-formers is the simplest means to prevent cross-contamination. The separate dedicated building configuration is not intended to accommodate the manufacturing of multiple products using spore-formers. If multiple products are manufactured in the same area or within the same building using spore-formers, then additional criteria will apply. See SS 600.11(e)(3)(ii) and section V. below.\n\nContainment\n\nBuilding Construction and Configuration\n\nIf you choose to use a separate dedicated building configuration for manufacturing processes involving spore-formers, your building must be constructed to prevent contamination. (SS 600.11(e)(3)(i)). Your separate dedicated building should be constructed with walls that extend to the ceiling with properly sealed joints at wall/ceiling intersections, separate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), water drops, sewer line, and an independent entrance thereby containing the building from surrounding areas.\n\nWe recommend that all surfaces be solid, hard, non-porous, and cleanable, including ceilings and walls. To the extent you are using aseptic processing, floors, walls, and ceilings should have smooth, hard surfaces that are easily cleanable.2\n\nFootnote 2: Please refer to FDA\u2019s guidance for industry entitled \u201cSterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing \u2013 Current Good Manufacturing Practice,\u201d dated September 2004 (October 4, 2004, 69 FR 59258) (http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5882fnl.htm), for the agency\u2019s current thinking on aseptic processing.\n\nAir Handling Units (AHUs)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Manufacturing Biological Intermediates and Biological Drug Substances Using Spore-Forming Microorganisms \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.635534763336182", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: Performing manufacturing operations under conditions and controls that protect against the potential for growth of microorganisms and the potential for contamination (21 CFR 111.365(a));\n\nWashing or cleaning components that contain soil or other contaminants (21 CFR 111.365(b));\n\nUsing water that, at a minimum, complies with the applicable Federal, State, and local requirements and does not contaminate the dietary supplement when the water may become a component of the finished batch of dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.365(c));\n\nPerforming chemical, microbiological, or other testing, as necessary to prevent the use of contaminated components (21 CFR 111.365(d));\n\nSterilizing, pasteurizing, freezing, refrigerating, controlling hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), controlling humidity, controlling water activity (aw), or using any other effective means to remove, destroy, or prevent the growth of microorganisms and prevent decomposition (21 CFR 111.365(e));\n\nHolding components and dietary supplements that can support the rapid growth of microorganisms of public health significance in a manner that prevents the components and dietary supplements from becoming adulterated (21 CFR 111.365(f));\n\nIdentifying and holding any components or dietary supplements, for which a material review and disposition decision is required, in a manner that protects components or dietary supplements that are not under a material review against contamination and mix-ups with those that are under a material review (21 CFR 111.365(g));\n\nPerforming mechanical manufacturing steps (such as cutting, sorting, inspecting, shredding, drying, grinding, blending, and sifting) by any effective means to protect the dietary supplements against contamination (21 CFR 111.365(h));\n\nUsing effective measures to protect against the inclusion of metal or other foreign material in components or dietary supplements (21 CFR 111.365(i));\n\nSegregating and identifying all containers for a specific batch of dietary supplements to identify their contents and, when necessary, the phase of manufacturing (21 CFR 111.365(j)); and\n\nIdentifying all processing lines and major equipment used during manufacturing to indicate their contents, including the name of the dietary supplement and the specific batch or lot number and, when necessary, the phase of manufacturing (21 CFR 111.365(k)).

However, you have flexibility to develop and use other mechanisms to satisfy this requirement. For example, if you make one type of product that you distribute to a select few customers, you may be able to trace the dietary supplement using dates on distribution records to such customers, by using different containers, or by labeling other than a batch, lot, or control number affixed to the label.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34900)3.

For example, a viral seed could be exposed to the following potential sources of contamination: the person or animal from which it was isolated; the cells and raw materials (e.g., serum or trypsin) used in its isolation and attenuation; materials used in banking and propagation of cells for viral seed growth; and other materials used during production and filling of the seed. You should also consider the species of origin of your cell substrates, viral seeds, and other biological starting materials in selecting your tests to ensure the absence of contaminants. Furthermore, you should consider any infectious viruses (including those that infect nonhuman species) as potential contaminants if there is the possibility of contact with your product or cell substrate at any time during development or production. Retrovirus may be either endogeneous (i.e., encoded by the cell substrate genome) or exogenously acquired. Retrovirus testing should address the possibility that either type of retrovirus could contaminate a product. Finally, you should consider the possibility of contamination from unusual sources, as exemplified by the reported presence of minute virus of mice (MVM) in some lots of recombinant proteins (Ref. 5). The susceptibility of the cell substrate to infection by agents of potential concern can influence the tests needed to assure absence of contamination.\n\nUse of qualified raw materials can reduce the risk of introducing adventitious agents. For example, inactivation of viruses by irradiation of serum could provide additional assurance regarding the purity of the final product.\n\n3 Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and Cell Substrate Development\n\nConcepts of quality design consistent with cGMP (see 21 CFR Part 211) are relevant to the selection of suitable cell substrates and viral seeds. If your cell substrate or viral seed was not originally derived under concepts consistent with cGMP, additional documentation (e.g., donor and source of raw materials), testing, and production steps might be necessary to support its use. This may include having some virus seeds re-derived or further purified to reduce the possibility of adventitious agent contamination.\n\n4 Use of Control-Cell Cultures\n\nWe recommend the use of control cells when it is not feasible to directly test cells or product at various stages of manufacture. For example, if you are using primary cell cultures to propagate your vaccine virus, complete testing of the primary culture might not be feasible prior to inoculation of virus. In this situation, when possible, you should produce and test uninfected control-cell cultures that are derived in parallel with, and handled in the same manner as, the production culture.\n\nControl-cell cultures are also useful for testing in situations when your vaccine virus can interfere with the results of testing of the virus seed or vaccine product (e.g., when the virus cannot be adequately neutralized to permit testing for adventitious agents). Control cell cultures should be propagated under conditions similar to conditions of manufacture for a time appropriate to the reason for performing the cultures. This time period may be 14 days or more, when needed to allow for detection of potential adventitious agents that may be latent, endogenous, or poorly replicating. Control-cell cultures should be processed simultaneously with your production culture, but left uninfected. Control cells should be evaluated for the presence of adventitious agents using the same tests that would have been performed on the production cultures, if it were feasible. Tests for adventitious agents should be performed on control cells at times at which you would perform similar tests on your manufactured product. Testing of control cells does not always eliminate the need for testing final product (see Section III.F.6).\n\nAssay Validation\n\nYou should demonstrate the reliability of assays or tests used to evaluate your cell substrate in the context of intended use. Assays related to assurance of safety should be scientifically valid (for example, by formal validation and/or inclusion of appropriate controls or standards) prior to initiation of clinical trials. Guidance regarding validation of analytical assays may be obtained from the ICH Q2(R1) documents (Ref. 6). Test methods should be validated according to the principles defined in these guidance documents. Certain \"compential\" tests (for example, those promulgated by the USP) might not require full validation, as long as you verify their suitability for their intended purpose under your actual conditions of use (Ref. 7). You should use appropriate statistical analyses to support your assay validation. This may include assessment of assay accuracy, precision, limits of detection, limits of quantification, specificity, linearity and range, ruggedness and robustness, and system suitability. Further guidance in this regard may be obtained from the ICH Q2(R1) document (Ref. 6).\n\nAppendix B Properties of the Cell Substrate\n\nThe cell substrate you choose for production of your viral vaccine should be well characterized. Your application should address the following issues.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProperties Relevant to Cell Substrate Selection\n\nAssuming that the vaccine virus strain remains stable during passage in cell culture is an important component of cell substrate selection. Different cell lines may apply different selective pressures on the vaccine virus, which could alter its sequence and possibly its phenotype. For example, when Sabin poliovirus strains are grown in different cells, their likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence is different (Ref. 8). If attenuating mutations or other genetic markers (including expression of antigens relevant to immune response) of the vaccine virus are known, data regarding the influence of serial passage in the cell substrate on retention of these markers can be useful in characterizing the genetic stability of the vaccine virus.\n\nWhatever starting materials are used for the generation of the cell substrate (e.g., parent cells or plasmids used for genetically engineered cells), any available information about those starting materials and their characterization (e.g., sequence of the plasmid) should be provided. If a sponsor starts with a primary cell to generate a novel cell substrate, complete information on donor screening and testing should be provided.\n\nSource\n\nYou should document the species of origin and the tissue type of your cell substrate. You should also document the medical history of the donor and the results of any screening and testing performed on the donor or on samples from the donor. When feasible, human donors should be screened and tested in a manner comparable with whole blood or source plasma donors, as described in 21 CFR Part 640. Animal donors should be screened and tested by applying similar concepts, and should be in general good health (except in cases where the cell substrate is derived from a tumor) and free from symptoms of infectious diseases. Ideally, animals intended to be donors should be quarantined prior to sacrifice or obtaining the sample to be used to generate the cell substrate (Ref. 9). (Issues specific to bovine- and porcine-derived materials are discussed in Sections IV.A.2.f and IV.A.2.g.) The species of origin is highly relevant, because different animal species have different potential contaminants, and some animal cells might be capable of propagating human viruses that are of potential concern as adventitious agents. Tissue type is also an important element for you to describe and consider in deciding on testing strategies. For example, neuronal cells might be more likely to harbor latent viruses (e.g., herpesvirus) or express infectious prion proteins (PrP) and should be evaluated for these potential adventitious agents. Additional considerations might apply to cells that are tumor-derived.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nHistory (including identifying characteristics) and other important characteristics\n\nThe history of your vaccine cell substrate must be identified under 21 CFR 610.18(c)(1)(i) and should include, to the extent available: sources and testing of the raw materials to which it was exposed in its passage history; listing of any other agents handled or grown in the same biosafety cabinet or incubators around the time of cell substrate passage; and the conditions under which it was passaged (including adherence to cGMPs, if applicable). In some cases (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] cells and Vero cells), multiple related cell lines or cell clones exist, and it is important to specify which of these related lines are being used, including the source from which it was obtained and its passage (or population doubling) level. All available documentation of all raw materials of human or animal origin you used for the entire passage history should be retained and considered in developing a testing program.

This outcome is distinct from outcomes limited to \"temporary increase in clear nail\" in nails which are fungally-infected, which is considered an aesthetic endpoint, and does not necessarily signify successful eradication of fungal infection, but rather an effect on the structure/function of the nails. The Agency recognizes that this endpoint may have functional benefits as well, which may be of some value to the patient if the improvement in appearance or function is clinically significant and if the benefits outweigh potential risks of the treatment. Nonetheless, claims related to appearance remain distinct from claims of eliminating fungal infection.\n\nThis guidance addresses patient populations in the United States as the intended demographic for intervention. The recommendations regarding clinical trial design may be applicable for any medical device type that is intended for temporary increase of clear nail or to treat onychomycosis (fungal nail infection). These recommendations would apply to clinical performance data submitted in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions, Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designations (de novo submissions), and Premarket Approval (PMA) applications, as well as for Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs).2\n\nFootnote 2: Currently marketed devices indicated for temporary increase in clear nail have been cleared through the 510(k) pathway. As such, this guidance refers to \u201cclearances\u201d and \u201cdevices cleared.\u201d However, wherever such terminology is used in this document, the recommendations and considerations may apply to all premarket submission types (e.g., PMA, de novo).\n\nThe need for clinical performance data will be dependent on the design and use of the device.3 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss this with the agency. In addition, we recommend that you contact the Agency through the pre-submission process prior to starting any clinical study for these nail indications. For information on the pre-submission process see FDA's guidance\n\nFootnote 3: One example of a device type that has been cleared for the indication of \u201ctemporary increase in clear nail\u201d is light-based devices. Refer to the Appendix for an example of the information that FDA recommends be submitted in a regulatory application for this device class.\n\n\"Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu\n\nments/UCM311176.pdf).\n\nThis guidance is not intended to replace the policies described in other guidance documents. In cases where questions arise, consult the appropriate FDA review division directly or the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Division of Industry and Consumer Assistance (DICE).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nNail dystrophy is commonly due to fungal infection (onychomycosis), but approximately 40% of nails which appear abnormal may be due to other clinical conditions.4 A wide variety of disorders, including inflammatory, metabolic, genetic, and non-fungal infectious diseases, as well as physical trauma to the nail, can create abnormal nail structures. These changes, which include separation of the distal nail from the nail bed, nail thickening, and color changes within the nail, can be visually indistinguishable from onychomycosis.5 However, it cannot be assumed that treatments that alter the appearance of nails are necessarily effective in eliminating onychomycosis. Conversely, it cannot be assumed that treatments that are effective in treating onychomycosis would necessarily alter the appearance of nails, if the abnormal nail growth or appearance (dystrophy) were caused by a condition other than onychomycosis. It is therefore important to distinguish the indications of \"temporary increase of clear nail in patients with onychomycosis\" and \"treatment of onychomycosis,\" so as to differentiate the treatment goals.\n\nFootnote 4: Gupta AK, Jain HC, Lynde CW, Watteel GN, Summerbell RC. Prevalence and epidemiology of unsuspected onychomycosis in patients visiting dermatologists\u2019 offices in Ontario, Canada\u2013a multicenter survey of 2001 patients. International Journal of Dermatology. 1997;36(10):783-7.\n\nFootnote 5: Fletcher CL, Hay RJ, and Smeeton NC. Observer agreement in recording the clinical signs of nail disease and the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of fungal and non-fungal nail disease. British Journal of Dermatology. 2003;148, 558\u201362.\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide information related to both indications, when the device is applied to nails with confirmed fungal infection. The considerations in this guidance may not be equally applicable to nails whose appearance is altered by non-fungal causes. Therefore, prior to pursuing treatment of abnormally structured or dystrophic nails, it is critical to diagnose the underlying cause, and to base treatment decisions on proven therapies for the identified cause.\n\nTemporary increase of clear nail\n\nHistorically, devices have been cleared with the Indications for Use (IFU) of \"temporary increase of clear nail in patients with onychomycosis (e.g., dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and/or yeasts Candida albicans, etc.).\" This indication has been used to highlight that the outcomes for which the device has provided support are limited to visual improvement, an aesthetic endpoint, and not for mycological cure, which would constitute a medical endpoint. Several aspects of this IFU are noteworthy:\n\nThis IFU is not intended to mean that the treatment eliminates fungal infection. It does, however, convey that clinical studies performed in support of the IFU included nails with confirmed fungal infection.\n\nThe devices have primarily been assessed for their effectiveness in nails infected with the common fungal organisms; the effectiveness may not be comparable in nails infected with rare species.\n\nAs stated above, this indication should not be assumed to demonstrate effectiveness in other causes of nail dystrophy. Therefore dystrophic nails should be confirmed as fungally-infected prior to initiation of clinical trials or treatments that employ devices cleared with this IFU.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFinally, we recognize that some patients seek total clearing of their nails rather than partial clearance and this expectation should be clarified. Labeling and promotional materials should provide a transparent portrayal of representative results that were achieved in the clinical trials, both in terms of the extent of nail clearance and the timeline of effect.\n\nTreatment of onychomycosis\n\nIn contrast to treatments for increase in clear nail, treatments aimed at treating a fungal infection require evidence of an antifungal effect. Specifically, devices marketed with an indication of treating fungal infections of the nail are expected to provide evidence that the fungal infection in the nail has been eliminated. For treatment of toenail fungal infection, this indication, in most cases, will be supported by evidence of visual improvement in conjunction with negative fungal cultures and stains.\n\nFungal species: geographic and demographic considerations\n\nClinical studies performed outside the United States may not be applicable to the U.S. population due to different prevailing fungal organisms that may affect the nails. Therefore, studies performed in the U.S. are recommended. Data from clinical studies performed outside the U.S. should include a comprehensive analysis of all fungal species detected in the nails of the population screened for enrollment in the clinical study, and the analysis reveals a similar spectrum and distribution of fungal species.\n\nSpecial populations, including individuals with certain chronic diseases, occupational risks, or immune compromise, may have different or additional organisms in the nail, and the effectiveness demonstrated in clinical studies performed in healthy adults may not be sufficiently informative about these populations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Devices and Clinical Trial Design for the Treatment or Improvement in the Appearance of Fungally-Infected Nails Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.56811809539795"], "Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1997-D-0056)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-1997-D-0056\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1997-D-0056).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Label Warning Statements for Iron-Containing Supplements and Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.137066602706909", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2009-D-0260\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Submitting a Report for Multiple Facilities to the Reportable Food Electronic Portal (Spanish Translation) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.9874136447906494", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2009-D-0260\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260).\n\n(\\copyright) Search for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Submitting a Report for Multiple Facilities to the Reportable Food Electronic Portal (French Translation) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.93217134475708", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) -

[Moved to Final from Draft September 2021]\n\nA.I.24.: When an applicant is seeking licensure for an indication for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity, an applicant should submit data and information to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for this indication.18 For example, an applicant may submit data and information intended to provide sufficient scientific justification for extrapolation to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for one or more indications, including an indication(s) for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity. In reviewing such information under section 351(k), FDA will not approve the proposed product for the protected indication(s).19\n\nFootnote 19: See License for Fewer than All Conditions of Use Guidance for information about timing of submissions for supplements seeking licensure for indications protected by unexpired exclusivity. This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nII Provisions Related to Requirement to Submit a Bla for a \"Biological Product\"\n\nThis question and its answer have been withdrawn. For information on the definition of \"protein\" in section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act, see Final Rule on Definition of the Term \"Biological Product\" (85 FR 10057, February 21, 2020) and 21 CFR 600.3(h)(6). [\\ast\\ast\\ast\\ast]\n\nHow is \"product class\" defined for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period? [Final April 2015]\n\nFor purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA, a proposed biological product will be considered to be in the same product class as a protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, if both products are homologous to the same gene-coded sequence (e.g., the INS gene for insulin and insulin glargine) with allowance for additional novel flanking sequences (including sequences from other genes). Products with discrete changes in gene-coded sequence or discrete changes in post-translational modifications may be in the same product class as the previously approved product even if the result may be a change in product PK.\n\nFor naturally derived protein products that do not have identified sequences linked to specific genes and that were approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, a proposed biological product is in the same product class as the naturally derived protein product if both products share a primary biological activity (e.g., the 4-number Enzyme Commission code for enzyme activity).\n\nHowever, for any protein product (whether naturally derived or otherwise), if the difference between the proposed product and the protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act alters a biological target or effect, the products are not in the same product class for purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA.\n\nQ.II.3: What type of marketing application should be submitted for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.II.3. A BLA should be submitted for a proposed monoclonal antibody that is linked to a drug (antibody-drug conjugate). FDA considers an antibody-drug conjugate to be a combination product composed of a biological product constituent part and a drug constituent part (see 21 CFR 3.2(e)(1); 70 FR 49848, 49857-49858 (August 25, 2005)).\n\nCDER is the FDA center assigned to regulate antibody-drug conjugates, irrespective of whether the biological product constituent part or the drug constituent part is determined to have the primary mode of action. For more information, see section 503(g) of the FD&C Act; see also, e.g., Transfer of Therapeutic Biological Products to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (June 30, 2003), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm136265.htm; Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (October 31, 1991), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm121179.htm.\n\nTo enhance regulatory clarity and promote consistency, CDER considered several factors to determine the appropriate marketing application type for antibody-drug conjugates, including the relative significance of the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the constituent parts, particularly the highly specific molecular targeting by the antibody to a cell type, cellular compartment, or other marker at the site of action (as distinguished from mere alteration of systemic PK).\n\nIn light of such factors, CDER considers submission of a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act to provide the more appropriate application type for antibody-drug conjugates.\n\nSponsors seeking to submit a BLA for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate may contact CDER's Office of New Drugs at 301-796-0700 for further information.\n\nIII Exclusivity\n\nCan an applicant include in its 351(a) BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act? [Final December 2018]\n\nYes. An applicant may include in its BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act, and FDA will consider the applicant's assertions regarding the eligibility of its proposed product for exclusivity. For more information, see FDA's draft guidance for industry Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products Filed Under Section 351(a) of the PHS Act.20 The draft guidance describes the types of information that reference product sponsors should provide to facilitate FDA's determination of the date of first licensure for their products. Footnote 20: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nHow can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nThe FDA's Orphan Drug Product designation database is available to search for orphan drug designations and/or approvals. The database is updated monthly (see https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/index.cfm). FDA will not approve a subsequent application for the same drug for the same indication during the 7-year period of orphan exclusivity, except as otherwise provided in the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 316.\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.63975191116333", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: A.I.7. An applicant generally may obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nFor information about the licensure of a proposed interchangeable product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.5\n\nFootnote 5: As explained in that guidance, FDA generally expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product\u2019s licensed conditions of use.\n\nQ.1.8. Can a sponsor use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.8. A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.\n\nIf a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. As a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies(e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compare all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product), and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK data or, when appropriate, PD data, for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the prespecified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed. A final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge will be made during the review of the application.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include but are not limited to the following:\n\nRelevance of the design of the clinical program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product for the condition(s) of use and patient population(s) for which licensure is sought\n\nRelationship between the license holder for the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and BLA holder for the U.S.-licensed reference product\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was manufactured in a facility(ies) licensed and inspected by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) countries)\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries) and the duration and extent to which the product has been marketed\n\nScientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK or, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on product performance\n\nA sponsor should also address any other factors that may affect the relevance of comparative data with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to an assessment of biosimilarity with the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA sponsor may submit publicly available information regarding the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to justify the extent of comparative data needed to establish a bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. The complexity of the products, particularly with respect to higher order structure, post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), and the degree of heterogeneity associated with the product may affect the considerations for the scientific justification regarding the extent of bridging data. Additional factors that FDA may consider regarding the extent of bridging data include but are not limited to the following:\n\nWhether the formulation, dosage form, and strength of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products are the same\n\nRoute of administration of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products\n\nDesign of the physicochemical and biological/functional assessments and the use of multiple orthogonal methods with adequate sensitivity to detect differences among the products\n\nScientific justification for the selection of the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used to establish the scientific bridge and how the selected lots relate to the material used in the nonclinical and clinical studies; the scientific bridge should include a sufficient number of lots of non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to adequately capture the variability in product quality attributes, and when possible, the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used in the nonclinical or clinical studies should be included in the assessment performed to establish the analytical bridge\n\nSponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of this scientific justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFor more information about whether a non-U.S.-licensed comparator can be used in studies intended to support the additional criteria required for a determination of interchangeability with the reference product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.\n\nQ.I.9.: Is a clinical study to assess the potential of the biological product to delay cardiac repolarization (a QT/QTc study) or a drug-drug interaction study generally needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.9. In general, a 351(k) application for a proposed biosimilar product may rely upon the Agency's previous determination of safety, purity, and potency for the reference product, including any clinical QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential and drug-drug interactions. If such studies were not required for the reference product, then these data generally would not be needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, if the BLA holder for the reference product has been required to conduct postmarket studies or clinical trials under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to assess or identify a certain risk related to a QT/QTc study or a drug-drug interaction study and those studies have not yet been completed, then FDA may impose similar postmarket requirements on the 351(k) applicant in appropriate circumstances.\n\nQ.1.10: How long and in what manner should sponsors retain reserve samples of the biological products used in comparative clinical PK and/or PD studies intended to support a 351(k) application? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.10.: Reserve samples establish the identity of the products tested in the actual study, allow for confirmation of the validity and reliability of the results of the study, and facilitate investigation of further follow-up questions that arise after the studies are completed. FDA recommends that the sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product retain reserve samples for at least 5 years following the date on which the 351(k) application is licensed, or, if such application is not licensed, at least 5 years following the date of completion of a comparative clinical PK and/or PD study of the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product (or other clinical study in which PK or PD samples are collected with the primary objective of assessing PK or PD similarity) that is intended to support a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Contact FDA for specific advice if an alternative approach is being considered. For a three-way PK similarity study, FDA recommends that samples of both comparator products be retained, in addition to samples of the proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor most protein therapeutics, FDA recommends that a sponsor retain the following quantities of product and dosage units, which are expected to be sufficient for evaluation by state of the art analytical methods:\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.5892608165740967", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: b. Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product's proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product's proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word \"biosimilar.\"For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product's indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n\nImmunogenicity information for therapeutic protein products is usually placed in a subsection in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section entitled Immunogenicity. To help health care providers interpret the significance of the information, the following or a similar statement should be included as the first paragraph in the subsection, preceding the immunogenicity data based on the reference product labeling:\n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other [core name] products may be misleading.\n\nFda-Approved Patient Labeling\n\nIf a Medication Guide is required, applicants must follow existing Medication Guide regulations for biosimilar product labeling.17 If the FDA-approved patient labeling for the reference product includes Patient Information, applicants should develop Patient Information for the biosimilar product, incorporating relevant information from the Patient Information for the reference product, with appropriate modifications.\n\nFootnote 17: See 21 CFR part 208.\n\nIf the FDA-approved patient labeling for the reference product includes Instructions for Use (IFU), the IFU for the proposed biosimilar product should incorporate relevant information from the IFU for the reference product and present the information in a similar manner. The proposed IFU may differ from the IFU for the reference product where, for example, modified language or images are needed to describe the biosimilar product accurately. If other changes are proposed beyond those necessary to describe the biosimilar product accurately, applicants should discuss proposed changes with the Agency, including whether such changes are appropriate and whether additional data to support such changes are warranted. Additionally, if there are plans to conduct a human factors study and the applicant intends to submit a protocol for FDA's review, the applicant should seek FDA input on the proposed IFU when the human factors study protocol is submitted for FDA review. A full and final review of proposed product labeling, including the IFU, will occur in the context of the planned 351(k) application and may be informed by any human factors study findings submitted or other relevant data included in the application.\n\nVI Revising Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nUpdating Safety Information\n\nDuring the lifecycle of a biological product, changes in the labeling may be necessary to provide updated information needed for the safe and effective use of the product. As the reference product and biosimilar product are used more widely or under diverse conditions, new information may become available. This may include new risks or new information about known risks. A biosimilar product application holder must comply with applicable requirements regarding adverse experience review, reporting, and recordkeeping (see 21 CFR 600.80).\n\nWhen new information becomes available that causes information in labeling to be inaccurate, false, or misleading, the application holder must take steps to change the content of its product labeling, in accordance with 21 CFR 601.12.18 All holders of marketing applications for biological products have an ongoing obligation to ensure their labeling is accurate and up to date.19 A biological product is misbranded, in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (FD&C Act), when its labeling is false or misleading; does not provide adequate directions for use and adequate warnings; or prescribes, recommends, or suggests a dosage, manner, frequency, or duration of use of the drug that is dangerous to health (see 21 U.S.C. 331(a) through (b) and 352(a), (f), and (j)).\n\nAdditional Conditions of Use\n\nFDA recognizes that a biosimilar product application holder may be interested in seeking licensure for an additional condition(s) of use after product licensure in the following scenarios:\n\nThe biosimilar product applicant originally obtained licensure for fewer than all of the conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is seeking licensure for one or more of the remaining licensed conditions of use of the reference product.\n\nThe biologics license application (BLA) holder for the reference product received licensure for a new condition of use for the reference product after the original licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nThe biosimilar product applicant may seek licensure for an additional condition(s) of use of the reference product in these scenarios by submitting a prior approval supplement(s) to the 351(k) application that contains the necessary data and information, including draft labeling revised to include the additional condition(s) of use sought. For more information on how to support licensure of the biosimilar product for an additional condition(s) of use for which the reference product is licensed, refer to the guidance documents on biosimilar product development on FDA's website.20\n\nFootnote 20: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm290967.htm\n\nVII How to submit initial and revised labeling\n\nNew BLAs and supplement submissions for biosimilar product labeling should include the following:\n\nA clean version of reference product labeling that was used to develop the biosimilar product labeling\n\nA tracked changes and annotated version of proposed biosimilar product labeling explaining the differences from the reference product labeling\n\nA clean version of the proposed biosimilar product labeling_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nVIII Interchangeable Products\n\nAny specific recommendations for labeling for interchangeable products, including any interchangeability statement similar to the biosimilarity statement described in section IV.C.1.b of this guidance, will be provided in future guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3750580549240112", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6615872383117676", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA's draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9039720892906189", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: The BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nAn exclusivity period for the first biological product determined to be interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use, during which a second or subsequent biological product may not be determined interchangeable with that reference product (see section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act)\n\nProcedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(l) of the PHS Act)\n\nTransition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously would have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below:\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class4 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010. Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term \u201cproduct class\u201d for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term \u201creference product\u201d means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)\") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\" provision\n\nFDA's Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s draft guidance for industry The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.5630764961242676"], "Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: VIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of \"Serving size,\" \"Calories,\" and the numerical value for \"Calories,\" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and \"Nutrition Facts\" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., \"Amount Per Serving\" and \"% Daily Value\") and footnotes (e.g., \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n\nIntermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, have different type size requirements. All information within the nutrition label must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). However, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than eight dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). Similarly, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)).\n\nThe footnote stating that the \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\" is required if the percent DV is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)). On labels of products represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, the footnote statement must read: \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet\" if the % Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)).\n\nIf there is inadequate space to list the required information vertically, the list may be split. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent DV information given to the left (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). The column headings are also repeated (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). Figure 17 reflects this label formatting.\n\nIX When Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nIf you have $10 million or more in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2020. If you have less than $10 million in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2021.\n\nIf you manufacture single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, or other pure sugars and syrups, as well as the cranberry products discussed in the Final Guidance (Ref. 1), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2021, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label rule and the Serving Size rule.\n\nIf you manufacture certain dried cranberry products with added flavorings (Ref. 11), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2020, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule.\n\nX Why Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nFailure to comply with the final rule will render the covered food misbranded under section 403(q) of the FD&C Act and potentially other sections as well. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is misbranded constitutes a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act. Among potential consequences, committing a prohibited act can result in injunction and/or seizure (see sections 302 and 304 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 332 and 334)).\n\nFigure 17: Supplement Facts Label \u2013 Split List (101.36(e)(12))\n\nXI References\n\nThe following references are on display at the Dockets Management Staff ((HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852) and are available for viewing by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday; they are also available electronically at https://www.regulations.gov.

The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(v)\n54. Are there special requirements that I must follow for the labeling of dietary supplements for children? Yes. On products for children less than 2 years of age, other than infant formula, you must not declare calories from fat, calories from saturated fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and cholesterol. Also, on products for children less than 4 years of age, you may not include % DVs for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, or potassium.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

We now allow for the following additional abbreviations on labels for small and intermediate-sized packages: \"vitamin\" may be abbreviated as \"Vit.,\" \"potassium\" may be abbreviated as \"Potas.,\" and \"Includes\" may be abbreviated as \"Incl.\" These abbreviations will further conserve label space. In addition, we allow the abbreviations of \"Total carb.\" and \"Incl.\" to be used on dual-column display labels (see section VIII.D).\n\n3.3 What Type Size Must be Used for the Declaration of Calories on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nThe numeric value for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 14 point, and the word \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.4 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages Differ from the Standard Label Version?\n\nThe \" -- servings per container\" declaration immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading, as in the standard label version; however, it must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). If a linear display is used, then the actual number of servings (i.e., \"Servings\" as shown in Fig 10) may be listed instead of the servings per container declaration.\n\nThe declaration of \"Serving size,\" which follows below the \" -- servings per container\" or \"servings\" declaration, is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages. See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n11.3.5 Is the \"% Daily Value*\" Footnote Required on Foods in Small and Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nFor products in small and intermediate-sized packages that qualify for the use of the tabular or linear format as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), there is no longer a requirement to place an asterisk, followed by the statement \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,\" at the bottom of the label if the footnote corresponding to \"% Daily Value\" is omitted. If \"Daily Value\" is not spelled out in the heading, then an asterisk can be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement \"% DV = % Daily Value\" in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.6 VIII.D How Do I Comply with the Nutrition Labeling Formatting Requirements when Dual Column Labeling is Required or Provided Voluntarily?\n\nDual column labeling is required under certain conditions, and can be used in other situations. In the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 9003), we announced the availability of a separate Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That CanReasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry,\" which, among other topics, discusses a new requirement regarding the use of dual-column labeling (Ref. [9]). In the Federal Register of December 31, 2019 (84 FR 72230), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Sizes-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics.\" This final guidance also discusses formatting issues for dual-column labeling (Ref. [10]).\n\nRegarding specific formatting for dual column labeling, the final rule updates certain requirements. Directly following the serving size declarations, each column of nutrition information must contain a heading that accurately describes why a dual column is being utilized. For example, a product may provide nutrition information for two different RDI groups, like in Figure 11 below. A product may also provide nutrition information for two different forms of the same food (e.g., \"Per 1/4 cup mix\" and \"Per prepared portion\"), as in Figure 12 below (21 CFR 101.9(e)). The quantitative information by weight and percent DV must be presented for each column, and the columns are to be separated by vertical lines (21 CFR 101.9(e)(3)). Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals must be separated from the information on other nutrients by a bar and be arrayed vertically in the required order (21 CFR 101.9(e)(4)). Note that the \"Amount per serving\" statement is not required for the dual column formats (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)). See Figures 11 through 15 (see also 21 CFR 101.9(e)(5) and (e)(6)(i)).\n\nFigure 11: Dual Column Display for 2 different RDI Groups (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 12: Dual Columns, Two Forms of the Same Food (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 13: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Container (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15 shows the use of dual columns in a tabular display format for products. As mentioned above, \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, and the numeric amount for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). \"Serving size\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point; however, the \" - servings per container\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, as with the standard label version (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i) and (ii)). \"Amount per serving\" is not required (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)).\n\nVIIILE When Can the Simplified Format Be Used?\n\nYou can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). For foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, you can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total\n\nFigure 14: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Unit (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15: Tabular Dual Column Display (101.9(e)(6)(ii))\n\ncarbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). The definition of \"insignificant amount\" has not changed.\n\nThe footnote requirement which states, \"Not a significant source of (\\underline{\\ })\" (listing the name(s) of any nutrients listed in this paragraph that are present in insignificant amounts) still exists (21 CFR 101.9(f)(4)). While the full \"% Daily Value\" footnote (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)) is not required for the simplified format, the column header \"% Daily Value\" can be abbreviated as \"% DV.\" If this abbreviation is used, then an asterisk must be placed at the end of the abbreviation and the corresponding footnote must read, \"% DV = % Daily Value\" (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). No footnote is required if \"Daily Value\" is spelled out in the column header (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). Figure 16 displays an example of a simplified format label.\n\nVIIILF Are Foods in Small Packages with a Total Surface Area Available to Bear Labeling of Less than 12 Square Inches Exempt from the Nutrition Facts Labeling Requirements?\n\nNot always. Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are not exempt from bearing a Nutrition Facts label if a nutrition claim or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)) is used or as outlined for covered vending machine food (see 21 CFR 101.8(c)). However, as previously allowed, if your product qualifies for and uses the exemption (i.e., claims or other nutrition information are not presented on the label or in labeling or advertising), then you must list an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)(A)).\n\nVIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of \"Serving size,\" \"Calories,\" and the numerical value for \"Calories,\" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and \"Nutrition Facts\" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., \"Amount Per Serving\" and \"% Daily Value\") and footnotes (e.g., \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.873632550239563", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: 9.21 Containers should be clean and, where indicated by the nature of the intermediate or API, sanitized to ensure that they are suitable for their intended use.

Detailed discussion of experimental design (i.e., choice of species, dose and dosing frequency justifications, etc.) is outside the scope of this guidance. However, dosages should be appropriate to address any identified cause for concern or to provide exposure margins that are clinically relevant (e.g., when conducting a study with two early stage agents). & Because of the potential complexity of performing and interpreting a combination toxicity study with more than two entities, it is generally more practical for initial studies to evaluate combinations of no more than two entities.

(3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: For combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n\nCombination genotoxicity, safety pharmacology, or carcinogenicity studies generally are not recommended to support clinical trials or marketing if the individual agents have been tested according to current standards. In those cases where the patient population includes WOCBP and studies with the individual agent(s) have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk, combination studies are not recommended as a potential human developmental hazard has already been identified. If nonclinical embryo-fetal studies have indicated that neither agent poses a potential human developmental risk, combination studies are not recommended unless concerns exist, based on the properties of individual components, that their combination could give rise to a hazard for humans. In circumstances when the individual agents have been tested in embryo-fetal studies but embryo-fetal studies of the drug combination are warranted, the study(ies) of the combination should be available to support the marketing application.\n\nXviii. Continuing efforts to improve harmonization (18)\n\nIt is recognized that significant advances in harmonization of the timing of nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials for pharmaceuticals have already been achieved and are detailed in this guidance. However, differences remain in a few areas. Regulators and industry will continue to consider these differences and work towards further improving the drug development process.\n\nXix Endnotes (19)\n\nNote 1: In this document, exposure generally means group mean AUC. In some circumstances (e.g., if the compound or compound class is known to produce acute functional cardiovascular changes or central nervous system-related clinical signs), it might be appropriate to base the exposure margin on group mean Cmax values rather than AUC.\n\nNote 2: An assessment of male and female fertility by thorough standard histopathological examination on the testis and ovary in a repeated-dose toxicity study (generally rodent) of at least 2-week duration is considered to be as sensitive as fertility studies in detecting toxic effects on male and female reproductive organs (Refs. 3, 15, 16).\n\nNote 3: Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed.\n\nNote 4: A preliminary embryo-fetal study useful for this purpose is one with adequate dose levels; that includes assessment of fetal survival, body weight, and external and visceral examinations; that uses a minimum of six dams per group; and that has dams treated over the period of organogenesis. This preliminary nonclinical study should be conducted under high-quality scientific standards with data collection records readily available or under GLP conditions.\n\nNote 5: The pregnancy rate of women initially attempting to become pregnant is (\\sim)17 percent per menstrual cycle. Pregnancy rates estimated from phase 3 studies conducted in WOCBP were observed to be (<)0.1 percent per menstrual cycle. During these studies, subjects were encouraged to avoid pregnancy and measures were instituted to prevent pregnancy. Survey information from earlier phase 2 studies suggests that the pregnancy rates were lower than in phase 3 studies but the extent of further reduction could not be estimated due to the limited number of women enrolled. Based on the above phase 3 experience, phase 2 trials enrolling 150 WOCBP for 3 months are estimated to result in significantly less than 0.5 pregnancies per pharmaceutical under development.\n\nNote 6: Testing for photocarcinogenicity in rodents using currently available models (e.g., hairless rodent) is not considered useful in support of pharmaceutical development and generally is not recommended. If the phototoxicity assessment suggests a potential photocarcinogenic risk and an appropriate assay becomes available, the study should usually be completed before marketing and the results should be considered in the human risk assessment.\n\nReferences (20)\n\n[1] ICH S6 Safety Studies for Biotechnological Products\n\n[2] ICH E8 General Considerations for Clinical Trials\n\n[3] ICH S5(R2) Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products and Toxicity to Male Fertility\n\n[4] ICH S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals\n\n[5] ICH S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals\n\n[6] ICH S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of QT Interval Prolongation\n\n[7] ICH S3A Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies\n\n[8] National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research.

What are \"data to support a rationale for the combination study\"? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: Because existing developmental and regulatory pathways focus primarily on assessment of the safety and effectiveness of a single new investigational drug acting alone, or in combination with a previously approved drug, FDA believes guidance is needed to assist sponsors in the codevelopment of two or more new investigational drugs. Although interest in codevelopment has been most prominent in oncology and infectious disease settings, codevelopment also has potential application in other therapeutic settings. Therefore, this guidance is intended to describe a high-level, generally applicable approach to codevelopment of two or more new investigational drugs. It describes the criteria for determining when codevelopment is an appropriate option, makes recommendations about nonclinical and clinical development strategies, and addresses certain regulatory process issues.\n\nIII Determining Whether Codevelopment is an Appropriate Development Option\n\nCodevelopment generally will provide less information about the clinical safety and effectiveness and dose-response of the individual new investigational drugs intended to be used in combination than would be obtained if the individual drugs were developed alone. How much less information will vary depending on a variety of factors, including the stage of development at which the individual new investigational drugs cease to be studied independently. For example, in codevelopment scenarios in which rapid development of resistance to monotherapy is a major concern, it may not be possible or appropriate to obtain clinical data for each drug in the combination beyond phase 1 testing. Because co-development generally will provide less information about the individual new investigational drugs, it may present greater risk comparedto clinical development of an individual drug. Given this concern, FDA believes that codevelopment should ordinarily be reserved for situations that meet all of the following criteria:\n\nThe combination is intended to treat a serious disease or condition.4 Footnote 4: For purposes of this guidance, the term serious disease or condition refers to a disease or condition associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning. Short-lived and self-limiting morbidity will usually not be sufficient, but the morbidity need not be irreversible, provided it is persistent or recurrent. Whether a disease or condition is serious is a matter of clinical judgment, based on its impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the disease, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one. This definition is consistent with various statutory and regulatory provisions concerning the use of FDA-regulated medical products to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. See, e.g. \u00a7 561 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 USC \u00a7 360bbb) and corresponding regulations (21 CFR part 312 subpart I) regarding expanded access to unapproved therapies and diagnostics; \u00a7 505-1 of the FD&C Act (21 USC \u00a7 355-1) regarding Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies; FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 314 subpart H and 21 CFR part 601 subpart E regarding accelerated approval; and \u00a7 506 of the FD&C Act (21 USC 356 regarding fast track development and designation. 5 For purposes of this guidance, the term \u201cavailable therapy\u201d is interpreted as it is described in the guidance for industry on Available Therapy. This guidance is available on the CDER guidance page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nA full nonclinical characterization of the activity of both the combination and the individual new investigational drugs, or a short-term clinical study on an established biomarker, suggests that the combination may provide a significant therapeutic advance over available therapy and is superior to the individual agents5 A nonclinical model should demonstrate that the combination has substantial activity and provides greater activity, a more durable response (e.g., delayed resistance), or a better toxicity profile than the individual agents. Footnote 5: For purposes of this guidance, the term \u201cavailable therapy\u201d is interpreted as it is described in the guidance for industry on Available Therapy. This guidance is available on the CDER guidance page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThere is a compelling reason why the new investigational drugs cannot be developed independently (e.g., monotherapy for the disease of interest leads to resistance, one or both of the agents would be expected to have very limited activity when used as monotherapy). FDA recommends that sponsors consult with FDA on the appropriateness of codevelopment before initiation of clinical development of a combination.\n\nIV Nonclinical development\n\nDemonstrating the Biological Rationale for the Combination\n\nThe biology of the disease, pathogen, or tumor type should be sufficiently understood to provide a plausible biological rationale for the use of combination therapy to treat the disease or condition. For example, in an oncology setting, the biological rationale may be to intervene at different steps in the cell proliferation pathway. The biological rationale for a combination anti-infective therapy may be to target different metabolic pathways or different steps in the replication cycle of the pathogen to reduce the chance of developing resistance to the therapy or increase efficacy in treating disease caused by resistant organisms (e.g., multidrug-resistant tuberculosis).\n\nSponsors should develop evidence to support the biological rationale for the combination in an in vivo (preferable) or in vitro model relevant to the human disease or condition the product is intended to treat. The model should compare the activity of the combination to the activity of the individual drugs. The model should demonstrate that the combination has substantial activity and provides greater activity, a more durable response (e.g., delayed resistance), and/or a better toxicity profile than the individual new investigational drugs. In addition to valuable activity data, a relevant model may provide information about the relative doses of the individual new investigational drugs.\n\nNonclinical Safety Characterization\n\nFor detailed recommendations regarding nonclinical safety characterization for two or more new investigational drugs to be used in combination, sponsors should consult the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance on nonclinical safety studies (ICH M3(R2)).6 Section XVII of ICH M3(R2) (Combination Drug Toxicity Testing) includes a discussion of nonclinical safety studies appropriate in a combination drug development setting involving two early stage entities. ICH M3(R2) defines early stage entities as compounds with limited clinical experience (i.e., phase 2 studies or less), so the discussion is specifically applicable to the type of development described in this guidance. In situations in which it is possible to obtain only limited clinical data for the individual new investigational drugs, additional nonclinical data for the individual drugs or combination may be needed before beginning human studies with the combination (e.g., see section V.A.1 below). For codevelopment of anticancer combinations, sponsors should consult the guidance for industry ICH S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceticals.7\n\nFootnote 6: See the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceCollianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. ICH M3(R2) is a revision of the 1997 ICH guidance M3 Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals.\n\nV Clinical Codevelopment\n\nThis section provides a general roadmap and guiding principles for concurrent clinical development of two or more new investigational drugs to be used in combination. It includes recommendations for characterizing the clinical safety and effectiveness of the combination and, to the extent needed or possible, the individual drugs in the combination.\n\nNote: The appropriate review division should be consulted on the specifics of a given clinical development program.\n\nEarly Human Studies (Phase 1)\n\nThe main objectives of early studies in humans are to characterize the safety and pharmacokinetics of both the individual new investigational drugs and the combination and to provide data to support appropriate dosing for the combination in phase 2 testing.\n\nv.1.1 Safety of the Individual New Investigational Drugs\n\nWhenever possible, the safety profile of each individual new investigational drug should be characterized in phase 1 studies in the same manner as would be done for the development of a single drug, including determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the nature of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and pharmacokinetic parameters. If there is a useful measure (e.g., biomarker) of pharmacologic activity, it will also be important to determine dose-response for that measure. If testing in healthy volunteers is not possible (e.g., if nonclinical data suggest a drug may be genotoxic or otherwise unacceptable for studies in healthy volunteers), the safety profile of the individual drugs should be evaluated in patients with the disease of interest. These safety data will guide decisions in later studies about starting doses, dose escalation increments, and final dose selection.\n--------------------\nContext title: Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.9143295288085938", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study.

The phrase \"responses to a medicinal product\" means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.\n\nRegarding marketed medicinal products: A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases or for modification of physiological function (see the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting).\n\nAdverse Event (AE)\n\nAny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (see the ICH Guidance for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting).\n\nAmendment (to the protocol)\n\nSee Protocol Amendment.\n\nApplicable Regulatory Requirement(s)\n\nAny law(s) and regulation(s) addressing the conduct of clinical trials of investigational products.\n\nApproval (in relation to institutional review boards (IRBs))\n\nThe affirmative decision of the IRB that the clinical trial has been reviewed and may be conducted at the institution site within the constraints set forth by the IRB, the institution, good clinical practice (GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nAudit\n\nA systematic and independent examination of trial-related activities and documents to determine whether the evaluated trial-related activities were conducted, and the data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, sponsor's standard operating procedures (SOPs), good clinical practice (GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).\n\nAudit Certificate\n\nA declaration of confirmation by the auditor that an audit has taken place.\n\nAudit Report\n\nA written evaluation by the sponsor's auditor of the results of the audit.\n\nAudit Trail\n\nDocumentation that allows reconstruction of the course of events.\n\nBlinding/Masking\n\nA procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are kept unaware of the treatment assignment(s).

What are \"data to support a rationale for the combination study\"? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: If in vitro studies, in vivo animal models, or phase 1 or other early clinical studies indicate that each new investigational drug has some activity, but the combination appears to have greater activity, and rapid development of resistance is not a concern, a four-arm, phase 2 trial in the disease or condition of interest comparing the combination to each drug alone and to placebo or standard of care (SOC) (AB v. A v. B v. SOC or placebo8) should be used to demonstrate the contribution of the individual drugs to the combination and proof of concept. If SOC is a known effective therapy (not solely palliative), a study design in which each of the arms is added to SOC could be used (AB + SOC v. A + SOC v. B + SOC v. placebo + SOC).\n\nFootnote 8: Note that in this scenario the placebo arm is intended to show the effect size compared to no treatment, not to show the contribution of each drug.\n\nAn adaptive trial design9 with the same four treatment arms might also be used where appropriate, initially using the treatment arms described above and terminating the single-drug arms early if it becomes clear that the single agents have much less activity than the combination. Such a design may demonstrate the contribution of each drug to the activity of the combination without exposing the large number of patients typically required for phase 3 trials to therapeutic products with inadequate activity. When determining whether to terminate monotherapy treatment arms early, it may be necessary to use endpoints that provide evidence of treatment effect more readily than endpoints that would be used in confirmatory phase 3 trials to minimize the amount of time subjects may be exposed to a low activity drug. For example, it may be preferable to use viralload, response rate, or a persuasive pharmacodynamic or other biomarker rather than survival or cure rate.\n\nScenario 2: The individual new investigational drugs in the combination cannot be administered separately\n\nIf in vitro studies, in vivo animal models, or phase 1 or other early clinical studies indicate that the individual new investigational drugs in the combination cannot be administered separately in clinical trials in the disease of interest (e.g., because such testing would involve administering treatment known to be ineffective as monotherapy), or cannot be administered as monotherapy for the duration needed to evaluate effectiveness (e.g., because of rapid development of resistance), proof-of-concept evidence for the combination ordinarily should come from a study directly comparing the combination (AB) to SOC. Alternatively, if SOC is known effective therapy (not solely palliative), an add-on design could be used comparing the combination plus SOC to placebo plus SOC.\n\nIn some resistance scenarios, it may be possible to administer the individual drugs in the combination as monotherapy for a short duration, but long enough to establish proof of concept in humans. For example, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to treat chronic hepatitis C virus infection could be administered as monotherapy for 3 days to establish antiviral activity and for initial dose exploration. For DAA studies of longer duration, the combination should be used or the individual drugs should be added to an active control.10\n\nFootnote 10: See the draft guidance for industry Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection: Developing Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents for Treatment (section III.A.4.b \u2013 Phase 1b (proof-of-concept) trials)) or consult the Division of Antiviral Drug Products in CDER for more specific recommendations. This draft guidance is available on the CDER guidance page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nScenario 3: When administered separately, one new investigational drug in the combination is active and one is inactive\n\nIf in vitro studies, in vivo animal models, or phase 1 or other early clinical studies suggest that one of the new investigational drugs in the combination is inactive or minimally active and one drug is modestly active, but the combination has substantial activity, the more active drug generally will require greater scrutiny and should ordinarily be studied as a single drug in a phase 2 study. The minimally active drug generally would not require study as a single drug beyond initial phase 1 safety studies. In this scenario, proof of concept and the contribution of each new investigational drug could be demonstrated using a three-arm comparison of the active drug alone, the combination, and SOC (A v. AB v. SOC), or the combination and the individual drug added to SOC where SOC is a known effective therapy (AB + SOC v. A + SOC v. placebo + SOC).\n\nIf the inactive drug in a combination contributes to the activity of the combination only by increasing the systemic concentrations of the active drug, human pharmacokinetic data may provide adequate evidence to support the contribution of the inactive drug. A confirmatory study of the combination would usually be needed to provide evidence of effectiveness for the combination (see section V.D).\n\nDose Finding -- Dose-finding studies could be very important to refine the combination dose or doses and select doses for phase 3 trials. Depending on the role of each new investigational drug, it may be useful to test multiple doses of both drugs to establish the optimal combination dose in terms of risks and benefits. If one new investigational drug in a two-drug combination is more active than the other, it may be more important to study multiple doses of the more active drug (as part of the combination). For the same reason, it may be more important to study multiple doses of a drug that is significantly more toxic than the other drug in the combination. Other study designs and types of studies also may be appropriate.\n\nConfirmatory Studies (Phase 3)\n\nThe appropriate phase 3 study design generally will be a case-by-case determination based on what has been previously demonstrated about the effects of the combination and the individual new investigational drugs, the feasibility of monotherapy and SOC alone treatment arms, and other factors. For example:\n\nIf findings from in vivo or in vitro models and/or phase 2 trials adequately demonstrate the contribution of each new investigational drug to the combination, phase 3 trials comparing the combination to SOC or placebo generally will be sufficient to establish effectiveness.\n\nIf the contribution of the individual new investigational drugs is not clear and it is ethically feasible to use one or more of the individual drugs as monotherapy in a study arm, the contribution of the individual drugs could be demonstrated using a factorial design (see Scenario 1 in section V.C). It may be possible to do a factorial study using only active drug treatment arms (AB v. A v. B). This design would be adequate to demonstrate the contribution of each new investigational drug, but would not be able to directly measure the overall treatment effect. However, if the effect of SOC is well-established and known to be small, it may be possible to estimate the treatment effect of the combination without a concurrent SOC or placebo arm.\n\nIf phase 2 data do not provide sufficient evidence of the contribution of each new investigational drug in a two-drug combination, but do provide strong evidence that the combination is superior to one of the drugs alone, a two-arm design comparing the combination to the more active drug alone (AB v. A) may be needed to demonstrate that the less active drug (B) contributes to the activity of the combination. In this situation, it may be useful to study more than one dose of the more active drug.\n\nUnexpected toxicity (e.g., serious adverse events observed at higher than expected rates) in phase 2 trials is a potential complication for development of a combination and progressing to phase 3 trials. If the toxicity can be attributed to one drug in the combination, it may be possible to conduct phase 3 trials with the combination using a lower dose or doses of the more toxic drug.\n\n3.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the toxicity cannot be attributed to an individual drug in the combination, additional studies may be needed to identify the more toxic drug and appropriate dosing for the combination before initiating phase 3 trials. The specifics of any phase 3 design should be discussed with the appropriate FDA review division at an end-of-phase 2 meeting.\n\nVI Regulatory Process Issues in Codevelopment\n\nSponsors should consider a number of regulatory issues when planning the codevelopment of two or more new investigational drugs for use in combination. Key issues are outlined below.\n\nEarly Interaction with FDA\n\nSponsors are encouraged to communicate as early as possible (e.g., pre-IND meeting) with the appropriate CDER review division when considering codevelopment. Sponsors also are encouraged to consult FDA as needed throughout the development process. We expect that such communication will help facilitate development of the combination therapy.\n\nInvestigational New Drug Applications (INDs)\n\n1.1.1 INDs for the Combination and the Individual New Investigational Drugs\n\nDecisions about IND submissions required under 21 CFR part 312 for the combination and individual new investigational drugs in the combination will depend on the development objectives and the timing of the decision to pursue codevelopment. The following general principles apply:\n\nIf a sponsor intends to undertake codevelopment as described in this guidance, there should be one IND for the combination that covers all of the drugs in the combination at the point in time at which the sponsor initiates clinical studies of the combination.\n--------------------\nContext title: Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.522552967071533"], "After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product's standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a \"2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for packages and in a \"linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using \"human-readable or machine-readable methods.\"11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled \"Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,\" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency's thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A \"product\" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a \"prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.\"\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of \u201ctransaction\u201d (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a \"product\" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining \u201cproduct.\u201d\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of \u201cproduct\u201d under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered \u201cradioactive drugs\u201d or \u201cradioactive biological products\u201d, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: \u00a7 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

Product Identifier is defined in section 581(14) and includes the product\u2019s standardized numerical identifier, which is composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number (see section 581(20)).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nProduct Tracing and Verification\n\nUnder section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act, trading partners are required to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information22 for each transaction23 involving a DSCSA-covered MMA product. For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA\u2019s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA's view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, \u201cSubmission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,\u201d on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA's initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated \"May Proceed\" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA's timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA's website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2014 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019).

The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: \"Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry\" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3508355617523193", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProceduralProduct Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -\n\nCompliance Policy\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are availablefrom:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{\\text{th}}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drug/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: (ocod)@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers \"affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce\" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms \u201chomogeneous\u201d and \u201chomogenous\u201d are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term \u201chomogenous\u201d throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product's standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA's draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for \"products,\" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. \"Prescription drugs\" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of \"labeling\" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant's annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., \"lot number\" and \"expiration date\") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3506312072277069", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n\nDispensers should refer to the Verification Systems Draft Guidance for a detailed description of responsibilities that are applicable to them, as the compliance policy described in this section applies only to the dispenser requirements regarding verification of product identifiers described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act and does not apply to any other provision in section 582 of the FD&C Act. This compliance policy does not address any of the other verification requirements set forth in section 582(d)(4) of the FD&C Act. For example, this compliance policy does not affect the requirement that as of November 27, 2020, a dispenser may engage in transactions involving a product only if such product is encoded with a product identifier (except as provided pursuant to section 582(a)(5) of the FD&C Act),29 and this compliance policy does not affect the other activities required by section 582(d)(4)(A) and section 582(d)(4)(B) by incorporation (e.g., dispensers must still quarantine product, conduct investigations, and disposition illegitimate product). This compliance policy does not relieve a manufacturer of its verification obligations pursuant to section 582(b)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act upon receiving a request for verification from an authorized dispenser.\n\nFootnote 29: See section 582(d)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis compliance policy aligns with the statutory requirements for an enhanced drug distribution system discussed above in section III of this guidance. When effective on November 27, 2023,the enhanced system must include as part of the transaction information the product identifier for each package in the transaction.30 The enhanced system must also allow for the verification of product at the package level.31 In addition, the enhanced system must allow for the ability to promptly generate and provide specific product and transaction documentation upon request by FDA, another Federal or State official, or an authorized trading partner for purposes of investigating suspect or illegitimate product.32 FDA believes that dispensers can use this 3-year period to ensure the systems and processes that are put into place to meet the enhanced system requirements by November 27, 2023, will also fulfill all dispenser verification requirements under section 582(d)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 582(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 31: See section 582(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 32: See section 582(g)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1241271495819092"], "Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA's human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, \"Investigational Device Exemptions.\"\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA's letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA's letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA's IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, \u201cProcedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices\u201d at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor's description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of \"significant risk\" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.7779570817947388", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFactors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nGuidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor- Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on January 13, 2017.\n\nThis guidance will have a 60 day implementation period.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on June 18, 2015.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Device Evaluation, Office of the Director, Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) Staff at 301-796-5640.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is committed to improving U.S. patient access to new devices by strengthening and streamlining the clinical trial enterprise so that medical device clinical trials are conducted in the U.S. in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining appropriate patient and research participant protections.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide greater clarity for FDA staff and investigational device exemption (IDE) sponsors and sponsor-investigators1 regarding the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing the benefits and risks of IDE applications for human clinical studies.\n\nConsistent with applicable laws and regulations, FDA may disapprove an IDE application if, among other reasons, \"[t]here is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained.\"2 In many cases, the Agency believes that effective risk management, including the application of risk controls, which includes risk mitigation measures, can result in a favorable IDE benefit-risk determination.\n\nFDA recognizes that in assessing risks and anticipated benefits, the medical device total product lifecycle should be considered, and that earlier stages of device development and investigational clinical study are typically associated with greater uncertainty (i.e., a lower level of evidence). A primary goal of this guidance is to clarify the factors that FDA considers when assessing risks and anticipated benefits as significant contributors to the decision to approve IDE studies, and how uncertainty may be offset by a variety of risk mitigation measures which can ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings. For proposed IDE studies, at earlier stages of device development, FDA considers appropriate mitigation measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages, FDA considers whether risk mitigation measures focus on the most probable risks.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\nAnother important goal of this guidance is to characterize benefits in the context of investigational research, which includes direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for evaluating marketing applications, FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting in which the study is being proposed, including but not limited to characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed, the availability of and risks associated with alternative treatments or diagnostics. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and their perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment. See for more information FDA Guidance, Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA believes use of this benefit-risk framework will facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. FDA envisions this will facilitate a common understanding between FDA and sponsors/sponsor-investigators by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors influence FDA's decisions. This guidance document will also help improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for IDE applications.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing benefits and risks of original IDE applications, IDE amendments and IDE supplements for human clinical investigations of certain medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness. The approach discussed in this guidance is applicable to studies subject to the IDE requirements in 21 CFR part 812, including postmarket studies. In general, IDE applications are required for clinical investigations of significant risk devices to determine safety and effectiveness.3 This guidance applies to both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This guidance is not intended to provide recommendations regarding device-specific data or study requirements.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7972300052642822", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Clinical Policy\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nAugust 2023\n\nGood Clinical Practice\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]\n\nInformed Consent\n\nGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance document was developed by the Office of Clinical Policy (OCIIP), in coordination with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.459129273891449", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: If a clinical study is needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to obtaining 510(k) clearance of the device, the study should generally be conducted under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, 21 CFR 812. Generally, we believe PTA balloon catheters and specialty catheters addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of 21 CFR part 812. Please see the FDA guidance, \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.\"13 In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR part 812, sponsors of such trials must comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR part 50). When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States are submitted to FDA for PTA and specialty catheters, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply.14 21 CFR 812.28 outlines the conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations conducted outside the US when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more information, see the FDA guidance, \"Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.\"15\n\nFootnote 13: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/significant-risk-and-nonsignificant-risk-medical-device-studies\n\nFootnote 14: Applies to data from clinical investigations that began on or after February 21, 2019 and are submitted to support a premarket submission, including IDEs, PMAs, and 510(k)s.\n\nFootnote 15: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/acceptance-clinical-data-support-medical-device-applications-and-submissions-frequently-asked\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nIn some cases, \"real-world data\" (RWD) may be used to support expansion of the indication for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be required. For additional information regarding this topic, please refer to the FDA Guidance entitled \"Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices.\"16\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nAppendix J Labeling\n\nThe regulatory submission must include proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e) for premarket notifications. Labeling for PTA balloon catheters and specialty balloons should include all applicable information, including indications, contraindications, warnings, product information, a summary of the clinical data (if applicable), and directions for use.\n\nAs prescription devices, PTA balloon and specialty catheters are exempt from having adequate directions for lay use under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as long as the conditions in 21 CFR 801.109 are met. For instance, labeling must include adequate information for practitioner use of the device, including indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration (e.g., infusion time, inflation duration), and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR 801.109(d)).\n\nAppendix K Modifications\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device change or modification \"that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device\" or represents \"a major change or modification in the intended use of the device\" requires a new 510(k).17 The changes or modifications listed below are examples of changes that may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that are likely to require submission of a new 510(k). For additional details, please see FDA guidance \"Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.\"18\n\nFootnote 17: Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, Title III of Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (\u201cFDORA\u201d), enacted on December 29, 2022, added section 515C \u201cPredetermined Change Control Plans for Devices\u201d to the FD&C Act (section 515C). Under section 515C, FDA can approve or clear a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) for a device that describes planned changes that may be made to the device and that would otherwise require a supplemental premarket approval application or premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that a supplemental premarket approval application (section 515C(a)) or a premarket notification (section 515C(b)) is not required for a change to a device if the change is consistent with a PCCP that is approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides that FDA may require that a PCCP include labeling for safe and effective use of a device as such device changes pursuant to such plan, notification requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan, and performance requirements for changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your marketing submission, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH.

Additionally, the test results should fall within the acceptance criteria previously found to be acceptable.\n--------------------\nContext title: Peripheral Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) and Specialty Catheters - Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.628494143486023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: The sponsor must advise its clinical investigators about the SR status and obtain their agreement to comply with the applicable regulations governing such studies (i.e., 21 CFR Parts, 50, 56, 812) (See 21 CFR 812.43(c)(4)(i)). Sponsors should provide the IDE number and/or a copy of the IDE approval letter to the IRB when requested.\n\nSponsors may send their SR device study to an IRB for review before the IDE application is approved by FDA. However, FDA cautions that an SR device study may not begin until FDA approves the IDE.\n\nV What Are the IRB's responsibilities when it receives a device study for review?\n\nIRBs should have standard operating procedures that explain how the IRB makes SR and NSR determinations and that the decision should be documented. FDA considers this determination to be part of the IRB's responsibilities for conducting its initial review of a study. (See 21 CFR 56.108)\n\nIRBs should make the SR or NSR determination about a study by reviewing relevant information at a convened meeting. This information includes the description of the device, reports of prior investigations conducted with the device, the proposed investigational plan, and subject selection criteria. The sponsor should provide the IRB with a risk assessment and the rationale used in making its SR or NSR determination.\n\nAn IRB may agree or disagree with the sponsor's initial NSR assessment.\n\nIf the IRB determines the study is NSR, the IRB may approve the study using the criteria at 21 CFR 56.111. The study may begin without submission of an IDE application to FDA.\n\nIf the IRB disagrees with the sponsor's NSR assessment and decides the study is SR, the IRB must tell the clinical investigator, and where appropriate, the sponsor. (See 21 CFR 812.66)* An IRB may approve the study as an SR device study, but the study may not begin until FDA approves the sponsor's IDE application.\n\nTo facilitate the IRB's review of the study, an IRB may ask the sponsor for proof (i.e., a copy of FDA's approval or conditional approval letter) that an SR study has an FDA-approved IDE application.\n\nThe IRB should document its SR/NSR determination in the IRB meeting minutes.\n\nVI What Should Irbs Consider When Making the SR and Nsr Determination?\n\nWhat is the basis for the risk determination? The risk determination is based on the proposed use of a device in an investigation, and not on the device alone.\n\nWhat is the nature of harm that may result from use of the device? SR studies are those that present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. See the question \"What is a Significant Risk Device Study?\" for further information.\n\nWill the subject need to undergo an additional procedure as part of the investigational study, for example, a surgical procedure? IRBs should consider the potential harm the procedure could cause as well as the potential harm caused by the device. Several examples follow:\n\nThe study of a change to a commercially available pacemaker (e.g., new leads, battery pack, or software) poses an SR because the device is used to support or sustain human life and it presents a potential for serious harm to the subjects. This is true even though the changed pacemaker may potentially pose less risk, or only slightly greater risk, in comparison to the commercially available model.\n\nThe study of an extended wear contact lens is SR because wearing the lens continuously overnight while sleeping presents a potential for injuries not normally seen with daily wear lenses, which are NSR.\n\nAn investigational study of a sensor pad to find out if the device can detect the electrical activity of the spinal cord may be NSR, if the study of the sensor pad takes place at the same time as the planned surgical repair of the spinal cord, if all the following are true: - repair of the spinal cord would occur anyway;the sensor pad does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject (for example, placing the pad would not prolong or interfere with the operation); - the sensor pad is not implanted; - the pad is not of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease.\n\nVII How does an IRB document the SR or NSR determination?\n\nThe IRB should write its decision in the meeting minutes. The minutes should describe the IRB's reason for its SR or NSR determination and may also include the documentation used to establish the IDE status for the study. For an SR determination, such documentation may include, for example, a copy of the IDE approval or conditional approval letter from FDA. For an NSR determination, the documentation may include FDA's NSR determination where the agency has made the determination. FDA will issue an NSR letter upon written request.\n\nVIII What should an IRB do for device studies that are exempt from the requirements of the ide regulations (21 CFR 812.2(c))?\n\nFor studies that are exempt from the IDE regulations, the IRB does not need to decide whether the study poses a significant risk or nonsignificant risk. However, the IRB must still review the study in accordance with the IRB regulations before the investigation may begin.\n\nIRBs should understand distinctions between certain important concepts that are frequently confused:\n\nDifference between NSR and Minimal Risk Determinations\n\nIRBs should not confuse their responsibility to make an SR/NSR determination for a device study with the concept of \"minimal risk.\" \"Minimal Risk\" is a term used in the IRB regulations in part to identify certain studies that IRBs may approve through an expedited review procedure. For a device study to be eligible for expedited review, it must be an NSR study AND present no more than minimal risk to the subject. (See 21 CFR 56.110)\n\nDifference Between SR/NSR Determinations and Approval Decisions\n\nIRBs should not confuse their responsibility to review and approve research for conduct at a clinical site with the SR/NSR determination. IRBs make the SR/NSR determination before the IRB conducts its review of the study under Part 56. The judgment about whether a study poses a significant risk or nonsignificant risk is based on the significance of the potential harm that may result from participation in the study, including the use of the device; whereas the IRB's decision to approve a study for implementation is based on the study's risk-benefit assessment.\n\n6 What Are Fda's Responsibilities?\n\nAs discussed, FDA is the final arbiter in deciding whether a device study poses a significant or nonsignificant risk. It should be noted, however, that FDA generally only sees those studies that sponsors submit to the agency or those studies for which an IRB or clinical investigator asks for FDA's opinion.\n\nIf FDA disagrees with an IRB's NSR decision and determines that the study poses a significant risk, the sponsor may not begin their study until FDA approves an IDE. (See 21 CFR 812.42)\n\nIf a sponsor submits an IDE to FDA because the sponsor presumed it to be an SR study, and FDA determines that the device study poses a nonsignificant risk, FDA will tell the sponsor in writing. The study may then be reviewed by the IRB as an NSR study.\n\n7 Examples of Nsr and Sr Devices\n\nThe following examples may help sponsors and IRBs in making SR and NSR determinations. The list includes many commonly studied medical devices. Inclusion of a device in the NSR list is not a final determination because the evaluation of risk must reflect the proposed use of a device in a study.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Devices\n\nCaries Removal Solution\n\nContact Lens Solutions intended for use directly in the eye (e.g., lubricating/rewetting solutions) using active ingredients or preservation systems with a history of prior ophthalmic/contact lens use or generally recognized as safe for ophthalmic use\n\nConventional Gastroenterology and Urology Endoscopes and/or Accessories\n\nConventional General Hospital Catheters (long-term percutaneous, implanted, subcutaneous and intravascular)\n\nConventional Implantable Vascular Access Devices (Ports)\n\nConventional Laparoscopes, Culdoscopes, and Hysteroscopes\n\nDaily Wear Contact Lenses and Associated Lens Care Products not intended for use directly in the eye (e.g., cleaners; disinfecting, rinsing and storage solutions)\n\nDental Filling Materials, Cushions or Pads made from traditional materials and designs\n\nDenture Repair Kits and Realigners\n\nDigital Mammography* Electroencephalography (e.g., new recording and analysis methods, enhanced diagnostic capabilities, measuring depth of anesthesia if anesthetic administration is not based on device output)\n\nExternally Worn Monitors for Insulin Reactions\n\nFunctional Non-Invasive Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulators\n\nGeneral Biliary Catheters\n\nGeneral Urological Catheters (e.g., Foley and diagnostic catheters) for short term use ((<28) days)\n\nJaundice Monitors for Infants\n\nLow Power Lasers for treatment of pain\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Devices within FDA specified parameters\n\nManual Image Guided Surgery\n\nMenstrual Pads (Cotton or Rayon, only)\n\nMenstrual Tampons (Cotton or Rayon, only)\n\nNonimplantable Electrical Incontinence Devices\n\nNonimplantable Male Reproductive Aids with no components that enter the vagina\n\nOb/Gyn Diagnostic Ultrasound within FDA approved parameters\n\nPartial Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis (PORP)\n\nTotal Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis (TORP)\n\nTranscutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Devices for treatment of pain (except for chest pain/angina)\n\nUreteral Stents\n\nUrethral Occlusion Device for less than 14 days\n\nWound Dressings, excluding absorbable hemostatic devices and dressings (also excluding Interactive Wound and Burn Dressings that aid or are intended to aid in the healing process)\n\nB. Significan t Risk Devices\n--------------------\nContext title: Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5857903957366943", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors must also report such information to FDA. Sponsors of drug/biologic studies are required under 21 CFR 312.31(a)(2) to report to FDA any information regarding the discontinuation of a clinical investigation in an information amendment to the Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Sponsors of device studies are required under 21 CFR 812.150(b)(2) to notify FDA and all reviewing IRBs and participating investigators of any withdrawal of IRB approval of an investigation or a part of an investigation within 5 working days after receipt of the withdrawal.\n\n(5) Confirming or establishing the date for the next continuing review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB performs a review at the time of clinical investigation transfer (whether an initial or a continuing review), it may choose to maintain the anniversary date of approval established by the original IRB or decide to establish a new anniversary date. If the receiving IRB decides to establish a new anniversary date, the new date must be within one year of the receiving IRB's review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB does not conduct a review of the clinical investigation at the time of transfer, the date of clinical investigation approval by the original IRB is presumed to remain in effect for the full approval period established at the time of the most recent review by the original IRB. For example, if the original IRB initially approved the clinical investigation for one year effective July 1, 2011, and the clinical investigation is transferred to a new IRB effective October 1, 2011, the expiration date of IRB approval would continue to be July 1, 2012, unless or until the receiving IRB establishes a new expiration date. Note that review in accordance with a newly established expiration date would nonetheless need to be conducted prior to the original July 1, 2012 expiration date.\n\n(6) Determining whether the consent form needs to be revised.\n\nThe informed consent document is required to contain \"[a]n explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject.\"35 Therefore, when a change in IRB oversight results in changes in the contact information regarding subject rights and/or whom to contact in the event of research-related injury, the new contact information must be provided to subjects. For subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active), this may be accomplished in a number of ways, including sending a letter providing the relevant contact information.36 For new subjects, the informed consent, assent, and/or parental permission form must be revised to reflect the new contact information.37 The clinical investigator should promptly notify the IRB of any such administrative changes to the consent form.\n\nFootnote 36: FDA does not require subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active) to be re-consented for such minor changes; however, IRBs may choose to do so.\n\nFootnote 37: 21 CFR 50.25(a)(7).\n\nOther changes to the consent form may also be necessary, for example, if the receiving IRB requires modifications to the consent form at the site(s) under its jurisdiction as a condition of approval (e.g., changes in template language, changes in risks, etc.).38 Depending upon the types of changes needed, they may be conveyed to the clinical investigator and sponsor as required modifications to secure IRB approval for the clinical investigation at that site or sites and may require reporting to FDA.39\n\nFootnote 38: 21 CFR 56.109(a) and (b).\n\nFootnote 39: 39 See, e.g., 21 CFR 56.109(a), 21 CFR 312.31, and 21 CFR 812.35.\n\nFootnote 40: 21 CFR 312.31(a).\n\n(7) Notifying the key parties.\n\nAs discussed above, all key parties involved in the transfer of oversight (e.g., clinical investigator, sponsor, and original and receiving IRBs) should discuss their respective responsibilities before implementing the transfer. In addition, the sponsor should notify pertinent entities involved in the clinical investigation (e.g., institutional members, Data Safety Monitoring Board, CRO), as and when appropriate. After IRB transfer of oversight for the clinical investigation is complete, the sponsor must update the associated IND40 or IDE41 with the name and contact information of the receiving IRB and should include the effective date of transfer.\n\nFootnote 41: 21 CFR 812.35(a)(4).\n\nFor studies for which the original IRB acts as a central IRB, those local institutions/IRBs that have written agreements with the original IRB (to transfer review responsibility to that original IRB) should be notified that responsibility for the study is now being transferred to a new central IRB (receiving IRB). We recommend that those local institutions/IRBs be given the option to enter into new written agreements with the receiving IRB or opt out of the central review arrangement if they do not believe central review by the receiving IRB is appropriate for their local institution (e.g., are concerned about the ability of the receiving IRB to adequately address local issues).42\n\nFootnote 42: For more information on the responsibilities of central IRBs and local institutions/IRBs with respect to central IRB review, see \u201cUsing a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,\u201d available at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127004.htm.\n\nAdditionally, when an IRB declines to accept oversight of a clinical investigation, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the appropriate party(ies) who initiated the transfer process (refer to page 3 for further information; parties responsible for initiating the transfer may not be those responsible for securing IRB review) to enable the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to make alternate arrangements for IRB review.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]\n\nthe reasons for the transfer and the risk posed by the study. In the case of a natural disaster, although the transfer may initially be thought to only be required for a short period of time, additional time may ultimately be needed before the original IRB is able to resume its oversight responsibilities. The original and receiving IRBs would need to ensure that study oversight does not lapse; adverse events are reported to the appropriate IRB, etc. during this interim period.\n\nAppendix B Transfer of a Clinical Investigation to a New Research Site Requiring IRB Review\n\nA sponsor may decide to transfer a clinical investigation to a different research site when, for instance, a clinical investigator relocates to that new site. Because the transfer involves changes to the research (i.e., conducting the research in a new location, consent form revisions, possible changes in key staff, etc.), the sponsor or investigator must submit these changes to the receiving IRB for review and approval, prior to implementing the changes.44 In many cases, these changes represent a \"minor change\" to the research, which the IRB may review under an expedited review procedure.45\n\nSuch a move to a new research site may or may not entail changing the IRB. If the reviewing IRB changes as a result, then the considerations described in Section III apply, except initial or continuing IRB review must be conducted (an IRB may not approve a change in research without first conducting an initial or continuing review).46\n\nFDA notes that, even if the IRB remains the same when a study is transferred to a new research site, IRB review/approval for the new research site is required because such a move is considered a change in previously approved research.47 Additionally, the sponsor must notify FDA of any change in research site, clinical investigator, and/or IRB. For drug or biologics studies, this notification can generally be accomplished through an IND protocol or information amendment, whereas for device studies it can generally be accomplished in an IDE annual report.48\n\nFootnote 44: 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4). For drug/biologic studies, clinical investigators are responsible for securing IRB approval under 21 CFR 312.66; for device studies, the sponsor is responsible under 21 CFR 812.35(a)(1) and (3).\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2).\n\nFootnote 46: 21 CFR 56.103(a), 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4), and 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2). There is an exception to this general requirement: changes necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects may be initiated without IRB review and approval, as described in 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: 21 Didd.\n\nFootnote 48: 21 CFR 312.30, 21 CFR 312.31, 21 CFR 812.35, and 21 CFR 812.150(b)(5).

Test reports should comply with the requirements of the corresponding test plans.\n\nSoftware products that perform useful functions in medical devices or their production are often complex. Software testing tools are frequently used to ensure consistency, thoroughness, and efficiency in the testing of such software products and to fulfill the requirements of the planned testing activities. These tools may include supporting software built in-house to facilitate unit (module) testing and subsequent integration testing (e.g., drivers and stubs) as well as commercial software testing tools. Such tools should have a degree of quality no less than the software product they are used to develop. Appropriate documentation providing evidence of the validation of these software tools for their intended use should be maintained (see section 6 of this guidance).\n\nTypical Tasks - Testing by the Software Developer\n\nTest Planning\n\nStructural Test Case Identification\n\nFunctional Test Case Identification\n\nUnit (Module) Tests to Detailed Design\n\nIntegration Tests to High Level Design\n\nSystem Tests to Software Requirements\n\nUnit (Module) Test Execution\n\nIntegration Test Execution\n\nFunctional Test Execution\n\nSystem Test Execution\n\nAcceptance Test Execution\n\nTest Results Evaluation\n\nError Evaluation/Resolution\n\nFinal Test Report\n\nUser Site Testing\n\nTesting at the user site is an essential part of software validation. The Quality System regulation requires installation and inspection procedures (including testing where appropriate) as well as documentation of inspection and testing to demonstrate proper installation. (See 21 CFR SS820.170.) Likewise, manufacturing equipment must meet specified requirements, and automated systems must be validated for their intended use. (See 21 CFR SS820.70(g) and 21 CFR SS820.70(i) respectively.)\n\nTerminology regarding user site testing can be confusing. Terms such as beta test, site validation, user acceptance test, installation verification, and installation testing have all been used to describe user site testing. For purposes of this guidance, the term \"user site testing\" encompasses all of these and any other testing that takes place outside of the developer's controlled environment. This testing should take place at a user's site with the actual hardware and software that will be part of the installed system configuration. The testing is accomplished through either actual or simulated use of the software being tested within the context in which it is intended to function.\n\nGuidance contained here is general in nature and is applicable to any user site testing. However, in some areas (e.g., blood establishment systems) there may be specific site validation issues that need to be considered in the planning of user site testing. Test planners should check with the FDA Center(s) with the corresponding product jurisdiction to determine whether there are any additional regulatory requirements for user site testing.\n\nUser site testing should follow a pre-defined written plan with a formal summary of testing and a record of formal acceptance. Documented evidence of all testing procedures, test input data, and test results should be retained.\n\nThere should be evidence that hardware and software are installed and configured as specified. Measures should ensure that all system components are exercised during the testing and that the versions of these components are those specified. The testing plan should specify testing throughout the full range of operating conditions and should specify continuation for a sufficient time to allow the system to encounter a wide spectrum of conditions and events in an effort to detect any latent faults that are not apparent during more normal activities.\n\nSome of the evaluations that have been performed earlier by the software developer at the developer's site should be repeated at the site of actual use. These may include tests for a high volume of data, heavy loads or stresses, security, fault testing (avoidance, detection, tolerance, and recovery), error messages, and implementation of safety requirements. The developer may be able to furnish the user with some of the test data sets to be used for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to an evaluation of the system's ability to properly perform its intended functions, there should be an evaluation of the ability of the users of the system to understand and correctly interface with it. Operators should be able to perform the intended functions and respond in an appropriate and timely manner to all alarms, warnings, and error messages.\n\nDuring user site testing, records should be maintained of both proper system performance and any system failures that are encountered. The revision of the system to compensate for faults detected during this user site testing should follow the same procedures and controls as for any other software change.\n\nThe developers of the software may or may not be involved in the user site testing. If the developers are involved, they may seamlessly carry over to the user's site the last portions of design-level systems testing. If the developers are not involved, it is all the more important that the user have persons who understand the importance of careful test planning, the definition of expected test results, and the recording of all test outputs.\n\nTypical Tasks - User Site Testing\n\n(\\bullet) Acceptance Test Execution\n\n(\\bullet) Test Results Evaluation\n\n(\\bullet) Error Evaluation/Resolution\n\n(\\bullet) Final Test Report\n\nMaintenance and Software Changes\n\nAs applied to software, the term maintenance does not mean the same as when applied to hardware. The operational maintenance of hardware and software are different because their failure/error mechanisms are different. Hardware maintenance typically includes preventive hardware maintenance actions, component replacement, and corrective changes. Software maintenance includes corrective, perfective, and adaptive maintenance but does not include preventive maintenance actions or software component replacement.\n\nChanges made to correct errors and faults in the software are corrective maintenance. Changes made to the software to improve the performance, maintainability, or other attributes of the software system are perfective maintenance. Software changes to make the software system usable in a changed environment are adaptive maintenance.\n\nWhen changes are made to a software system, either during initial development or during post release maintenance, sufficient regression analysis and testing should be conducted to demonstrate that portions of the software not involved in the change were not adversely impacted. This is in addition to testing that evaluates the correctness of the implemented change(s).\n\nThe specific validation effort necessary for each software change is determined by the type of change, the development products affected, and the impact of those products on the operation of the software. Careful and complete documentation of the design structure and interrelationships of various modules, interfaces, etc., can limit the validation effort needed when a change is made. The level of effort neededto fully validate a change is also dependent upon the degree to which validation of the original software was documented and archived. For example, test documentation, test cases, and results of previous verification and validation testing need to be archived if they are to be available for performing subsequent regression testing. Failure to archive this information for later use can significantly increase the level of effort and expense of revalidating the software after a change is made.\n\nIn addition to software verification and validation tasks that are part of the standard software development process, the following additional maintenance tasks should be addressed:\n\nFor software that was previously validated, the existing software validation plan should be revised to support the validation of the revised software. If no previous software validation plan exists, such a plan should be established to support the validation of the revised software.\n\nSoftware organizations frequently maintain documentation, such as software problem reports that describe software anomalies discovered and the specific corrective action taken to fix each anomaly. Too often, however, mistakes are repeated because software developers do not take the next step to determine the root causes of problems and make the process and procedural changes needed to avoid recurrence of the problem. Software anomalies should be evaluated in terms of their severity and their effects on system operation and safety, but they should also be treated as symptoms of process deficiencies in the quality system. A root cause analysis of anomalies can identify specific quality system deficiencies. Where trends are identified (e.g., recurrence of similar software anomalies), appropriate corrective and preventive actions must be implemented and documented to avoid further recurrence of similar quality problems. (See 21 CFR 820.100.)\n\nAll problems discovered during maintenance of the software should be documented. The resolution of each problem should be tracked to ensure it is fixed, for historical reference, and for trending.\n--------------------\nContext title: General Principles of Software Validation Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.981088876724243", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturing processes must consistently meet their parameters, and in-process materials must meet acceptance criteria or limits (SS 211.110(b) and (c)) so that, ultimately, finished pharmaceutical products will meet their acceptance criteria. Under a quality system, selected data are used to evaluate the quality of a process or product. In addition, data collection can provide a means to encourage and analyze potential suggestions for improvement. A quality systems approach calls for the manufacturer to develop procedures that monitor, measure, and analyze the operations (including analytical methods and/or statistical techniques). Monitoring of the process is important due to the limitations of testing. Knowledge continues to accumulate from development through the entire commercial life of a product. Significant unanticipated variables should be detected by a well-managed quality system and adjustments implemented. Procedures should be revisited as needed to refine operational design based on new knowledge. Process understanding increases with experience and helps identify when change will lead to continual improvement. When implementing data collection procedures, consider the following:\n\nAre data collection methods documented?\n\nWhen in the product life cycle will the data be collected?\n\nHow and to whom will measurement and monitoring activities be assigned?\n\nWhen should analysis and evaluation (e.g. trending) of laboratory data be performed? (see IV.D.1)What records should be collected?\n\nA modern quality system approach indicates that change control is warranted when data analysis or other information reveals an area for improvement. Changes to an established process must be controlled and documented to ensure that desired attributes for the finished product will be met (SS 211.100(a)).\n\nChange control with regard to pharmaceuticals is addressed in more detail in the CGMP regulations. When developing a process change, it is important to keep the process design and scientific knowledge of the product in mind. If major design issues are encountered through process experience, a firm may want to revisit the adequacy of the design of the manufacturing facility (SS 211.42), the design of the manufacturing equipment (SS 211.63), the design of the production and control procedures (SS 211.100), or the design of laboratory controls (SS 211.160). When implementing a change, its effect should be determined by monitoring and evaluating those specific elements that may be affected based on an understanding of the process. This approach allows the steps taken to implement a change and the effects of the change on the process to be considered systematically. Application of risk analysis may facilitate evaluating the potential effect of the change. Evaluating the effects of a change can entail additional tests or examinations of subsequent batches (e.g., additional in-process testing or additional stability studies). The quality system elements identified in this guidance, if implemented and maintained, will help a manufacturer manage change and implement continual improvement in manufacturing.\n\nUnder a quality systems approach, procedures should be in place to ensure the accuracy of test results. Test results that are out of specification may be due to testing problems or manufacturing problems and should be investigated. Any invalidation of a test result should be scientifically sound and justified.\n\nTo maintain quality, the Agency recommends that prior to completion of manufacturing, the manufacturer should consider storage and shipment requirements to meet special handling needs (in the case of pharmaceuticals, one example might be refrigeration).\n\nUnder a quality system, trends should be continually identified and evaluated. One way of accomplishing this is the use of statistical process control. The information from trend analyses can be used to continually monitor quality, identify potential variances before they become problems, bolster data already collected for the annual review, and facilitate improvement throughout the product life cycle. Process capability assessment can serve as a basis for determining the need for changes that can result in process improvements and efficiency (see IV.D.1.).\n\niv.3.4 Address Nonconformities\n\nA key component in any quality system is handling nonconformities and/or deviations. The investigation, conclusion, and follow-up must be documented (SS 211.192). To ensure that a product conforms to requirements and expectations, it is important to measure the process and the product attributes (e.g., specified control parameters, strength) as planned. Discrepancies may be detected during any stage of the process or during quality control activities. Not all discrepancies will result in product defects; however, it is important to document and handle discrepancies appropriately. A discrepancy investigation process is critical when a discrepancy is found that affects product quality (CGMP also requires this; see SS 211.192).\n\nIn a quality system, it is important to develop and document procedures that define who is responsible for halting and resuming operations, recording non-conformities, investigating discrepancies, and taking remedial action. Under a quality system, if a product or process does not meet requirements, it is essential to identify and/or segregate the product so that it is not distributed to the customer. Remedial action can include any of the following:\n\nCorrect the non-conformity\n\nWith proper authorization, allow the product to proceed with justification of the conclusions regarding the problem's impact\n\nUse the product for another application where the deficiency does not affect the products' quality\n\nReject the product\n\nThe corrected product or process should also be re-examined for conformance and assessed for the significance of the non-conformity (see, e.g., SS 211.115). If the non-conformity is significant, based on consequences to process control, process efficiency, product quality, safety, efficacy, and product availability, it is important to evaluate how to prevent recurrence (see IV.D.4.). If an individual product that does not meet requirements has been released, the product can be recalled.18 Customer complaints must be reviewed and then investigated if a discrepancy is identified (SS 211.198).\n\nFootnote 18: See 21 CFR Part 7.\n\nThe following table shows how the CGMP regulations correlate to specific elements in the quality systems model. Manufacturers should always refer to the specific regulations to ensure that they are comp\n\nAppendix D Evaluation Activities\n\nAs in the previous section, the elements of a quality system correlate closely with the requirements in the CGMP regulations. See the table at the end of the section for the specifics.\n\nd.0.1 Analyze Data for Trends\n\nQuality systems call for continually monitoring trends and improving systems. This can be achieved by monitoring data and information, identifying and resolving problems, and anticipating and preventing problems.\n\nQuality systems procedures involve collecting data from monitoring, measurement, complaint handling, or other activities, and tracking this data over time, as appropriate. Analysis of data can provide indications that controls are losing effectiveness. The information generated will be essential to achieving problem resolution or problem prevention (see IV.D.3.).\n\nAlthough the CGMP regulations (SS 211.180(e)) require product review on at least an annual basis, a quality systems approach calls for trending on a more frequent basis as determined by risk. Trending enables the detection of potential problems as early as possible to plan corrective and preventive actions. Another important concept of modern quality systems is the use of trending to examine processes as a whole; this is consistent with the annual review approach. Trending analyses can help focus internal audits (see IV.D.2.).\n\nd.0.2 Conduct Internal Audits\n\nA quality systems approach calls for audits to be conducted at planned intervals to evaluate effective implementation and maintenance of the quality system and to determine if processes and products meet established parameters and specifications. As with other procedures, auditprocedures should be developed and documented to ensure that the planned audit schedule takes into account the relative risks of the various quality system activities, the results of previous audits and corrective actions, and the need to audit the complete system. Procedures should describe how auditors are trained in objective evidence gathering, their responsibilities, and auditing procedures. Procedures should also define auditing activities such as the scope and methodology of the audit, selection of auditors, and audit conduct (audit plans, opening meetings, interviews, closing meeting and reports). It is critical to maintain records of audit findings and assign responsibility for follow-up to prevent problems from recurring (see IV.D.3.).\n\nThe quality systems model calls for managers who are responsible for the areas audited to take timely action to resolve audit findings and ensure that follow-up actions are completed, verified, and recorded. (FDA's policy is to refrain from both reviewing and copying reports or records that result from internal audits per Compliance Policy Guide 130.300.19)\n\nFootnote 19: See Reference #8.\n\niv.3.3 Quality Risk Management\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.1766340732574463", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: For purposes of this guidance, the term quality unit is synonymous with the term quality control unit. For the definition of quality control unit, see \u00a7 210.3(b)(15).\n\n3 Does each CGMP workflow on a computer system need to be validated?\n\nYes, a CGMP workflow, such as creation of an electronic master production and control record (MPCR), is an intended use of a computer system to be checked through validation (see SSSS 211.63, 211.68(b), and 211.110(a)). The extent of validation studies should be commensurate with the risk posed by the automated system. When the same system is used to perform both CGMP and non-CGMP functions, the potential for non-CGMP functions to affect CGMP operations should be assessed and mitigated appropriately.10\n\nFootnote 10: See note 8.\n\nIf you validate the computer system but you do not validate it for its intended use, you cannot know if your workflow runs correctly.11 For example, qualifying the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) platform, a computer system, ensures that it meets its relevant requirements and specifications; however, it does not demonstrate that a given MPCR generated by the MES contains the correct calculations. In this example, validating the workflow ensures that the intended steps, requirements, and calculations in the MPCR are accurate and perform properly. This is similar to reviewing a paper MPCR and ensuring all supporting procedures are in place before the MPCR is implemented in production (see SSSS 211.100, 211.186, and 212.50(b) and the guidance for industry PET Drugs--Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)).\n\nFDA recommends you implement appropriate controls to manage risks associated with each element of the system. Controls that are appropriately designed to validate a system for its intended use address software, hardware, personnel, and documentation.\n\n4 How should access to CGMP computer systems be restricted?\n\nYou must exercise appropriate controls to assure that changes to computerized MPCRs or other CGMP records or input of laboratory data into computerized records can be made only by authorized personnel (SS 211.68(b)). Other examples of records for which control should be restricted to authorized personnel include automated visual inspection records, electronic materials management system records, and automated dispensing system weighing records. FDA recommends that you restrict the ability to alter specifications, process parameters, data, or manufacturing or testing methods by technical means where possible (e.g., by limiting permissions to change settings or data).\n\nThe system administrator role, including any rights to alter files and settings, should be assigned to personnel independent from those responsible for the record content. To assist in controlling access, it is important that manufacturers establish and implement a method for documenting authorized personnel's access privileges for each CGMP computer system in use (e.g., by maintaining a list of authorized individuals) (see SS 211.68(b)).\n\n5 Why is FDA concerned with the use of shared login accounts for computer systems?\n\nWhen login credentials are shared, a unique individual cannot be identified through the login and the system would not conform to the CGMP requirements in parts 211 and 212. FDA requires that system controls, including documentation controls, be designed in accordance with CGMP to assure product quality (e.g., SSS 211.100 and 212.50). For example, you must implement documentation controls that ensure that the actions as described in question 4 are attributable to a specific individual (see SSS 211.68(b), 211.188(b)(11), 211.194(a)(7) and (8), and 212.50(c)(10)).\n\nShared, read-only user accounts that do not allow the user to modify data or settings are acceptable for viewing data, but they do not conform with the part 211 and 212 requirements for actions, such as second person review, to be attributable to a specific individual.\n\n6 How should blank forms be controlled?\n\nThere must be document controls in place to assure product quality (see SSS 211.100, 211.160(a), 211.186, 212.20(d), and 212.60(g)). For example, bound paginated notebooks, stamped for official use by a document control group, provide good document control because they allow easy detection of unofficial notebooks as well as any gaps in notebook pages. If used, blank forms (e.g., electronic worksheets, laboratory notebooks, and MPCRs) should be controlled by the quality unit or by another document control method. As appropriate, numbered sets of blank forms may be issued and should be reconciled upon completion of all issued forms. Incomplete or erroneous forms should be kept as part of the permanent record along with written justification for their replacement (see, e.g., SSS 211.192, 211.194, 212.50(a), and 212.70(f)(1)(vi)). All data required to recreate a CGMP activity should be maintained as part of the complete record.\n\n7 Who should review audit trails?\n\nAudit trail review is similar to assessing cross-outs on paper when reviewing data. Personnel responsible for record review under CGMP should review the audit trails that capture changes to data associated with the record as they review the rest of the record (e.g., SS SS 211.22(a), 211.101(c) and (d), 211.103, 211.182, 211.186(a), 211.192, 211.194(a)(8), and 212.20(d)). For example, all production and control records, which includes audit trails, must be reviewed and approved by the quality unit (SS 211.192). The regulations provide flexibility to have some activities reviewed by a person directly supervising or checking information (e.g., SS 211.188). FDA recommends a quality system approach to implementing oversight and review of CGMP records.12\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations. See also guidance for industry Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreements for information about auditing as it relates to contract facilities.\n\n8 How often should audit trails be reviewed?\n\nIf the review frequency for the data is specified in CGMP regulations, adhere to that frequency for the audit trail review. For example, SS 211.188(b) requires review after each significant step in manufacture, processing, packing, or holding, and SS 211.22 requires data review before batch release. In these cases, you would apply the same review frequency for the audit trail.\n\nIf the review frequency for the data is not specified in CGMP regulations, you should determine the review frequency for the audit trail using knowledge of your processes and risk assessment tools. The risk assessment should include evaluation of data criticality, control mechanisms, and impact on product quality.13\n\nFootnote 13: Risks to data include, but are not limited to, the potential to be deleted, amended, or excluded without authorization or without detection. Examples of audit trails that may be appropriate to review on a risk-based frequency include audit trails that capture instrument operational status, instrument communication logs, and alert records.\n\nYour approach to audit trail review and the frequency with which you conduct it should ensure that CGMP requirements are met, appropriate controls are implemented, and the reliability of the review is proven.\n\nSee the audit trail definition in 1.c. above for further information on audit trails.\n\n9 Can electronic copies be used as accurate reproductions of paper or electronic records?\n\nYes. Electronic copies can be used as true copies of paper or electronic records, provided the copies preserve the content and meaning of the original record, which includes all metadatarequired to reconstruct the CGMP activity and the static or dynamic nature of the original records.\n\nTrue copies of dynamic electronic records may be made and maintained in the format of the original records or in a format that allows for the content and meaning of the original records to be preserved if a suitable reader and copying equipment (e.g., software and hardware, including media readers) are readily available (SSSS 211.180(d) and 212.110).\n\nIs it acceptable to retain paper printouts or static records instead of original electronic records from stand-alone computerized laboratory instruments, such as an FT-IR instrument?\n\nA paper printout or static record may satisfy retention requirements if it is the original record or a true copy of the original record (see SSSS 211.68(b), 211.188, 211.194, and 212.60). During data acquisition, for example, pH meters and balances may create a paper printout or static record as the original record. In this case, the paper printout or static record, or a true copy, must be retained (SS 211.180).\n\nHowever, electronic records from certain types of laboratory instruments--whether stand-alone or networked--are dynamic, and a printout or a static record does not preserve the dynamic record format that is part of the complete original record. For example, the spectral file created by FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) is dynamic and can be reprocessed.\n\nHowever, a static record or printout is fixed and would not satisfy CGMP requirements to retain original records or true copies (SS 211.180(d)). Also, if the full spectrum is not displayed in the printout, contaminants may be excluded.\n\nYou must ensure that original laboratory records, including paper and electronic records, are subject to second-person review (SS 211.194(a)(8)) to make certain that all test results and associated information are appropriately reported. Similarly, in microbiology, a contemporaneous written record is maintained of the colony counts of a petri dish, and the record is then subject to second-person review.\n\nDocument control requirements in SS 211.180 pertain only to CGMP records.\n--------------------\nContext title: Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.761977434158325", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: The CGMP regulations require either testing or use of a certificate of analysis (COA) plus an identity analysis (SS 211.84) for the release of materials for manufacturing. In the preamble to the CGMP regulations, these requirements were explicitly interpreted.12 The preamble states that reliability can be validated by conducting tests or examinations and comparing the results to the supplier's COA. Sufficient initial tests should be done to establish reliability and to determine a schedule for periodic reassessment. As an essential element of purchasing controls, it is recommended that data trends for acceptance and rejection of materials be analyzed for information on supplier performance.13\n\nFootnote 12: See Reference #1, comment 239.\n\nFootnote 13: The Agency recommends that manufacturers have a measure of the variability of materials that could affect their process controls. For example, certain changes in physical properties may affect the process, which may affect a finished product\u2019s dissolution characteristics.\n\nThe quality systems approach also calls for periodic auditing of suppliers based on risk assessment. During the audit, a manufacturer can observe the testing or examinations conducted by the supplier to help determine the reliability of the supplier's COA. An audit should also include a systematic examination of the supplier's quality system to ensure that reliability is maintained. It is recommended that a combination approach be used (i.e., verify the suppliers' COA through analysis and audits of the supplier). Under a quality systems approach, if full analytical testing is not done, the audit should cover the supplier's analysis (i.e., a specific identity test is still required under SS 211.84(d)(2)).\n\nUnder a quality systems approach, procedures should be established to verify that materials are from qualified sources (for application and licensed products, certain sources are specified in the submissions). Procedures should also be established to encompass the acceptance, use, or the rejection and disposition of materials produced by the facility (e.g., purified water). Systems that produce these in-house materials should be designed, maintained, qualified, and validated where appropriate to ensure that the materials meet their acceptance criteria.\n\nIn addition, it is recommended that changes to materials (e.g., specification, supplier, or materials handling) be implemented through a change control system (certain changes require review and approval by the QU (SS 211.100(a)). It is also important to have a system in place to respond to changes in materials from suppliers so that necessary adjustments to the process can be made and unintended consequences avoided.\n\niv.2.3 Perform and Monitor Operations\n\nAn important purpose of implementing a quality systems approach is to enable a manufacturer to more efficiently and effectively validate, perform, and monitor operations (SS 211.100(a)) and ensure that the controls are scientifically sound and appropriate. The goal of establishing, adhering to, measuring, and documenting specifications and process parameters is to objectively assess whether an operation is meeting its design and product performance objectives. In a robust quality system, production and process controls should be designed to ensure that the finished products have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess (see, e.g., SS 211.100(a)).\n\nIn a modern quality system, a design concept established during product development typically matures into a commercial design after process experimentation and progressive modification. Risk management can help identify areas of process weakness or higher risk and factors that can influence critical quality attributes that should receive increased scrutiny. The FDA recommends that scale-up studies be used to help demonstrate that a fundamentally sound design has been fully realized. A sufficiently robust manufacturing process should be in place prior to commercial production. With proper design (see IV.C.1.) and reliable mechanisms to transfer process knowledge from development to commercial production, a manufacturer should be able to validate the manufacturing process.14 Conformance batches provide initial proof that the design of the process produces the intended product quality. Sufficient testing data will provide essential information on performance of the new process, as well as a mechanism for continual improvement. Modern equipment with the potential for continual monitoring and control can further enhance this knowledge base. Although initial commercial batches can provide evidence to support the validity and consistency of the process,15 the entire product life cycle should be addressed by the establishment of continual improvement mechanisms in the quality system.16 Thus, in accordance with the quality systems approach, process validation is not a one-time event, but an activity that continues throughout a product's life.\n\nFootnote 14: See Reference #5.\n\nFootnote 15: Even with good design and development work, initial conformance batches will provide confidence that future batches will meet specifications only if the process is repeated within defined operating parameters, equipment tolerances, personnel practices, environmental attributes, and material quality.\n\nAs experience is gained in commercial production, opportunities for process improvements may become evident. (CGMP regulations SS 211.180 require the review and evaluation of records to determine the need for any change. These records contain data and information from production that provide insight into the product's state of control. Change control systems should provide a dependable mechanism for prompt implementation of technically sound manufacturing improvements.)\n\nUnder a quality system, written procedures are followed and deviations from them are justified and documented (CGMP requires this; see SS 211.100(b)) to ensure that the manufacturer can trace the history of the product, as appropriate, concerning personnel, materials, equipment, and chronology and that processes for product release are complete and recorded.\n\nBoth the CGMP regulations (SS 211.110) and quality systems models call for the monitoring of critical processes that may be responsible for causing variability during production. For example:\n\nProcess steps must be verified by a second person (SS 211.188). Process steps can also be performed using a validated computer system. Batch production records must be prepared contemporaneously with each phase of production (SS 211.100(b)). Although time limits for production can be established when they are important to the quality of the finished product (CGMP addresses this; see SS 211.111), the manufacturer should have the ability to establish production controls using in-process parameters that are based on desired process endpoints measured using real time testing or monitoring apparatus (e.g., blend until mixed vs. blend for 10 minutes).\n\nProcedures must be in place to prevent objectionable microorganisms in finished products not required to be sterile and to prevent microbial contamination of finished products purported to be sterile. Sterilization processes must be validated for sterile drugs (SS 211.113(b)).17 Footnote 17: See Reference #7.\n\nManufacturing processes must consistently meet their parameters, and in-process materials must meet acceptance criteria or limits (SS 211.110(b) and (c)) so that, ultimately, finished pharmaceutical products will meet their acceptance criteria. Under a quality system, selected data are used to evaluate the quality of a process or product. In addition, data collection can provide a means to encourage and analyze potential suggestions for improvement. A quality systems approach calls for the manufacturer to develop procedures that monitor, measure, and analyze the operations (including analytical methods and/or statistical techniques). Monitoring of the process is important due to the limitations of testing. Knowledge continues to accumulate from development through the entire commercial life of a product. Significant unanticipated variables should be detected by a well-managed quality system and adjustments implemented. Procedures should be revisited as needed to refine operational design based on new knowledge. Process understanding increases with experience and helps identify when change will lead to continual improvement. When implementing data collection procedures, consider the following:\n\nAre data collection methods documented?\n\nWhen in the product life cycle will the data be collected?\n\nHow and to whom will measurement and monitoring activities be assigned?\n\nWhen should analysis and evaluation (e.g. trending) of laboratory data be performed? (see IV.D.1)What records should be collected?\n\nA modern quality system approach indicates that change control is warranted when data analysis or other information reveals an area for improvement. Changes to an established process must be controlled and documented to ensure that desired attributes for the finished product will be met (SS 211.100(a)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.85945987701416", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 5: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nThe control strategy provided in the application should include a proposal for use of alternative testing or monitoring approaches in cases of equipment failure. The alternative approach could involve use of end-product testing or other options, while maintaining an acceptable level of quality. Testing or monitoring equipment breakdown should be managed in the context of a deviation under the quality system and can be covered by GMP inspection. (Approved June 2009)\n\nAre product specifications different for minimal versus QbD approaches?\n\nIn principle no, product specifications are the same for minimal and QbD approaches. For a QbD approach, the control strategy can facilitate achieving the end product specifications via real time release testing approaches (see ICH Q8(R2) Annex, appendix 1). Product must meet specification, when tested.6 (Approved October 2009)\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System (3)\n\nQ1: What are the benefits of implementing a pharmaceutical quality system (PQS) (in accordance with ICH Q10)?\n\nThe benefits are:\n\nFacilitated robustness of the manufacturing process, through facilitation of continual improvement through science and risk-based postapproval change processes\n\nConsistency in the global pharmaceutical environment across regions\n\nEnable transparency of systems, processes, and organizational and management responsibility\n\nClearer understanding of the application of a quality system throughout product lifecycle\n\nFurther reducing risk of product failure and incidence of complaints and recalls, thereby providing greater assurance of pharmaceutical product consistency and availability (supply) to the patient\n\nBetter process performance\n\nOpportunity to increase understanding between industry and regulators and more optimal use of industry and regulatory resources; enhance manufacturer's and regulators' confidence in product quality\n\nIncreased compliance with GMPs, which builds confidence in the regulators and may result in shorter inspections (Approved April 2009)\n\nHow does a company demonstrate implementation of PQS in accordance with ICH Q10?\n\nWhen implemented, a company will demonstrate the use of an effective PQS through its documentation (e.g., policies, standards), its processes, its training/qualification, its management, its continual improvement efforts, and its performance against pre-defined key performance indicators (see ICH Q10 glossary on performance indicator).\n\nA mechanism should be established to demonstrate at a site how the PQS operates across the product lifecycle, in an easily understandable way for management, staff, and regulatory inspectors, e.g., a quality manual, documentation, flowcharts, procedures. Companies can implement a program in which the PQS is routinely audited in-house (i.e., internal audit program) to ensure that the system is functioning at a high level. (Approved April 2009)\n* Is it necessary to describe the PQS in a regulatory submission?\n* No, however relevant elements of the PQS (such as quality monitoring system, change control, and deviation management) can be referenced as part of the control strategy as supporting information. (Approved April 2009)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ4:: Will there be certification that the PQS is in accordance with ICH Q10?\n\nA4: No. There will not be a specific ICH Q10 certification program. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ5:: How should the implementation of the design space be evaluated during inspection of the manufacturing site?\n\nA5: Inspection should verify/assess that manufacturing operations are appropriately carried out within the design space. The inspector in collaboration with the assessor, where appropriate, should also verify successful manufacturing operations under the design space and that movement within the design space is managed within the company's change management system (see ICH Q10, section IV. B.3 (3.2), Table III). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ6:: What should be done if manufacturing operations run inadvertently outside of the design space?\n\nA6: This should be handled as a deviation under GMP. For example, unplanned \"one-off\" excursions occurring as a result of unexpected events, such as operator error or equipment failure, would be investigated, documented, and dealt with as a deviation in the usual way. The results of the investigation could contribute to the process knowledge, preventive actions, and continual improvement of the product. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ7:: What information and documentation of the development studies should be available at a manufacturing site?\n\nA7: Pharmaceutical development information (e.g., supporting information on design space, chemometric model, risk management) is available at the development site. Pharmaceutical development information that is useful to ensure the understanding of the basis for the manufacturing process and control strategy, including the rationale for selection of critical process parameters and critical quality attributes, should be available at the manufacturing site. Scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing between pharmaceutical development and manufacturing is essential to ensure the successful transfer to production. (Approved June 2009)\n\nQ8:: Can process parameters be adjusted throughout the product lifecycle?\n\nA8: Process parameters are studied and selected during pharmaceutical development and monitored during commercial manufacturing. Knowledge gained could be utilized for adjustment of the parameters as part of continual improvement of the process throughout the lifecycle of the drug product (see ICH Q10, section IV (3)). (Approved June 2009)\n\nImpact of New ICH Quality Guidance on GMP Inspection Practices (4)\n\nQ1: How will product-related inspections differ in an ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10 environment?\n\nIn the case of product-related inspection (in particular, preauthorization) depending on the complexity of the product and/or process, greater collaboration between inspectors and assessors could be helpful (for example, for the assessment of development data). The inspection would normally occur at the proposed commercial manufacturing site, and there is likely to be greater focus on enhanced process understanding and understanding relationships, e.g., critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters (CPPs). The inspection might also focus on the application and implementation of quality risk management principles, as supported by the pharmaceutical quality system (PQS). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ2: How will system-related inspections differ in an ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 environment?\n\nThe inspection process will remain similar. However, upon the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10, inspections will have greater focus on (but not only focus on) how the PQS facilitates the use of e.g., quality risk management methods, implementation of design space, and change management (see ICH Q10). (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ3: How is control strategy approved in the application and evaluated during inspection?\n\nElements of control strategy submitted in the application will be reviewed and approved by the regulatory agency. However, additional elements are subject to inspection (as described in Q10). (Approved October 2009)\n\nKnowledge Management (5)\n\nHow has the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 changed the significance and use of knowledge management?\n\nQ10 defines knowledge management as: \"Systematic approach to acquiring, analyzing, storing, and disseminating information related to products, manufacturing processes and components.\" Knowledge management is not a system; it enables the implementation of the concepts described in ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nKnowledge management is not a new concept. It is always important regardless of the development approach. Q10 highlights knowledge management because it is expected that more complex information generated by appropriate approaches (e.g., QbD, process analytical technology (PAT), real-time data generation, and control monitoring systems) should be better captured, managed, and shared during product life-cycle.\n\nIn conjunction with quality risk management, knowledge management can facilitate the use of concepts such as prior knowledge (including from other similar products), development of design space, control strategy, technology transfer, and continual improvement across the product life cycle. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ2:: Does Q10 suggest an ideal way to manage knowledge?\n\nA2: No. Q10 provides a framework and does not prescribe how to implement knowledge management. Each company decides how to manage knowledge, including the depth and extent of information assessment based on its specific needs. (Approved April 2009)\n\nQ3:: What are potential sources of information for knowledge management?\n\nA3: Some examples of knowledge sources are:\n\nPrior knowledge based on experience obtained from similar processes (internal knowledge, industry scientific and technical publications) and published information (external knowledge: literature and peer-reviewed publications)\n\nPharmaceutical development studies\n\nMechanism of action\n\nStructure/function relationships\n\nTechnology transfer activities\n\nProcess validation studies\n\nManufacturing experience, e.g., -- Internal and vendor audits -- Raw material testing data\n\nInnovation\n\nContinual improvement\n\nChange management activities\n\nStability reports\n\nProduct quality reviews/annual product reviews\n\nComplaint reports\n\nAdverse event reports (patient safety)\n\nDeviation reports, recall Information\n\nTechnical investigations and/or CAPA reports\n\nSuppliers and contractors* Product history and /or manufacturing history\n\nOngoing manufacturing processes information (e.g., trends)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q8, Q9, and Q10 Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.142177104949951", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Specifications must be scientifically sound and appropriate (\u00a7 211.160(b)), test procedures must be validated as to their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility (\u00a7 211.165(e)), and the suitability of the test procedures under actual conditions of use must be documented (\u00a7 211.194(a)(2)). For products that are the subjects of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), or investigational new drug applications (INDs), specifications are contained in the application or DMF. Specifications for nonapplication products may be found in official compendia or established by the manufacturer.\n\nBoth finished pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are to be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act. Current good manufacturing practice for APIs includes the performance of scientifically sound raw material testing, in-process monitoring, release and stability testing, process validation, and adequate investigations of any OOS result obtained from such testing. All citations to part 211 in this document pertain to finished pharmaceuticals, but these referenced regulatory requirements are also consistent with Agency guidance on CGMP for APIs with respect to laboratory controls, which include out-of-specification investigations. See FDA'sguidance for industry Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (September 2016) (ICH Q7) for specific recommendations.5\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs.\n\nThe responsibility of a contract testing laboratory in meeting these requirements is equivalent to that of a manufacturing firm.\n\nIII Identifying and Assessing OOS Test Results -- Phase I: Laboratory Investigation\n\nFDA regulations require that an investigation be conducted whenever an OOS test result is obtained (SS 211.192).6 The purpose of the investigation is to determine the cause of the OOS result. The source of the OOS result should be identified either as an aberration of the measurement process or an aberration of the manufacturing process. Even if a batch is rejected based on an OOS result, the investigation is necessary to determine if the result is associated with other batches of the same drug product or other products. Batch rejection does not negate the need to perform the investigation. The regulations require that a written record of the investigation be made, including the conclusions and follow-up (SS 211.192).\n\nFootnote 6: Although the subject of this document is OOS results, much of the guidance may be useful for examining results that are out of trend.\n\nTo be meaningful, the investigation should be thorough, timely, unbiased, well-documented, and scientifically sound. The first phase of such an investigation should include an initial assessment of the accuracy of the laboratory's data. Whenever possible, this should be done before test preparations (including the composite or the homogenous source of the aliquot tested) are discarded. This way, hypotheses regarding laboratory error or instrument malfunctions can be tested using the same test preparations. If this initial assessment indicates that no causative errors were made in the analytical method used to arrive at the data, a full-scale OOS investigation should be conducted. For contract laboratories, the laboratory should convey its data, findings, and supporting documentation to the manufacturing firm's quality unit (QU). The manufacturing firm's QU should then initiate the Phase 2 (full-scale) OOS investigation, whenever no clearly causative laboratory error was identified.\n\nResponsibility of the Analyst\n\nThe first responsibility for achieving accurate laboratory testing results lies with the analyst who is performing the test. The analyst should be aware of potential problems that could occur during the testing process and should watch for problems that could create inaccurate results.\n\nIn accordance with the CGMP regulations in SS 211.160(b)(4), the analyst should ensure that only those instruments meeting established performance specifications are used and that all instruments are properly calibrated.\n\nCertain analytical methods have system suitability requirements, and systems not meeting these requirements should not be used. For example, in chromatographic systems, reference standard solutions may be injected at intervals throughout chromatographic runs to measure drift, noise, and repeatability. If reference standard responses indicate that the system is not functioning properly, all of the data collected during the suspect time period should be properly identified and should not be used. The cause of the malfunction should be identified and, if possible, corrected before a decision is made whether to use any data prior to the suspect period.\n\nAnalysts should check the data for compliance with test specifications before discarding test preparations or standard preparations. When unexpected results are obtained and no obvious explanation exists, test preparations should be retained, if stable, and the analyst should inform the supervisor. An assessment of the accuracy of the results should be started immediately.\n\nIf errors are obvious, such as the spilling of a sample solution or the incomplete transfer of a sample composite, the analyst should immediately document what happened. Analysts should not knowingly continue an analysis they expect to invalidate at a later time for an assignable cause (i.e., analyses should not be completed for the sole purpose of seeing what results can be obtained when obvious errors are known).\n\nResponsibilities of the Laboratory Supervisor\n\nOnce an OOS result has been identified, the supervisor's assessment should be objective and timely. There should be no preconceived assumptions as to the cause of the OOS result. Data should be assessed promptly to ascertain if the results might be attributed to laboratory error, or whether the results could indicate problems in the manufacturing process. An immediate assessment could include re-examination of the actual solutions, test units, and glassware used in the original measurements and preparations, which might provide more credibility for laboratory error hypotheses.\n\nThe following steps should be taken as part of the supervisor's assessment:\n\nDiscuss the test method with the analyst; confirm analyst knowledge of and performance of the correct procedure.\n\nExamine the raw data obtained in the analysis, including chromatograms and spectra, and identify anomalous or suspect information.\n\nVerify that the calculations used to convert raw data values into a final test result are scientifically sound, appropriate, and correct; also determine if unauthorized or unvalidated changes have been made to automated calculation methods.\n\nConfirm the performance of the instruments.\n\nDetermine that appropriate reference standards, solvents, reagents, and other solutions were used and that they met quality control specifications.\n\nEvaluate the performance of the test method to ensure that it is performing according to the standard expected based on method validation data and historical data.\n\nFully document and preserve records of this laboratory assessment.\n\nThe assignment of a cause for OOS results will be greatly facilitated if the retained sample preparations are examined promptly. Hypotheses regarding what might have happened (e.g., dilution error, instrument malfunction) should be tested. Examination of the retained solutions should be performed as part of the laboratory investigation.\n\nExamples:\n\nSolutions can be re-injected as part of an investigation where a transient equipment malfunction is suspected. Such hypotheses are difficult to prove. However, reinjections can provide strong evidence that the problem should be attributed to the instrument, rather than the sample or its preparation.\n\nFor release rate testing of certain specialized dosage form drugs that are not destroyed during testing, where possible, examination of the original dosage unit tested might determine whether it was damaged during laboratory handling in a way that affected its performance. Such damage would provide evidence to invalidate the OOS test result, and a retest would be indicated.\n\nFurther extraction of a dosage unit, where possible, can be performed to determine whether it was fully extracted during the original analysis. Incomplete extraction could invalidate the test results and should lead to questions regarding validation of the test method.\n\nIt is important that each step in the investigation be fully documented. Laboratory management should ascertain not only the reliability of the individual value obtained, but also the significance these OOS results represent to the laboratory quality assurance program. Laboratory management should be especially alert to developing trends. As part of an effective quality system, a firm's upper management should appropriately monitor these trends and ensure that any problematic areas are addressed.\n\nLaboratory error should be relatively rare. Frequent errors suggest a problem that might be due to inadequate training of analysts, poorly maintained or improperly calibrated equipment, or careless work. Whenever laboratory error is identified, the firm should determine the source of that error and take corrective action to prevent recurrence. To ensure full compliance with the CGMP regulations, the manufacturer also should maintain adequate documentation of the corrective action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.245227336883545"], "With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA's human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, \"Investigational Device Exemptions.\"\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA's letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA's letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA's IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, \u201cProcedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices\u201d at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor's description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of \"significant risk\" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.1117210388183594", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on August 31, 2017.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on July 27, 2016\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB) at 301-796-5997 or CDRHCilicalEvidence@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CBER-regulated devices, contact the Office of Communication, Outreach, and Development (OCOD) at 1-800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nUA U.S. FOOD & DRUG\n\nACMINISTration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI.

Glossary 21\n\nUse of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and\n\nFood and Drug Administration Staff\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction and Scope\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to clarify how we evaluate real-world data to determine whether they are sufficient for generating the types of real-world evidence that can be used in FDA regulatory decision-making for medical devices. This guidance is applicable to all devices, as that term is defined under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), including software that meets the definition of a device.\n\nReal-World Data (RWD) are data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources.\n\nExamples of RWD include data derived from electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing data, data from product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile devices. RWD sources (e.g., registries, collections of EHRs, and administrative and healthcare claims databases) can be used as data collection and analysis infrastructure to support many types of trial designs, including, but not limited to, randomized trials, such as large simple trials, pragmatic clinical trials, and observational studies (prospective and/or retrospective ).\n\nReal-World Evidence (RWE) is the clinical evidence regarding the usage, and potential benefits or risks, of a medical product derived from analysis of RWD.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUnder the right conditions, data derived from real world sources can be used to support regulatory decisions. RWD and associated RWE may constitute valid scientific evidence depending on the characteristics of the data. This guidance should not be construed to alter, or change in any way, the existing evidentiary standards applicable to FDA's regulatory decision-making; rather, it describes the circumstances under which RWD may be used to support a variety of FDA decisions based on the existing evidentiary standards. While FDA encourages the use of relevant and reliable RWD, this guidance neither mandates its use nor restricts other means of providing evidence to support regulatory decision-making. This guidance highlights some of the potential uses of RWD, and describes the factors that FDA considers when evaluating whether specific RWD is of sufficient quality to inform or support a regulatory decision. It also clarifies when an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) may be needed to prospectively collect and use RWD for purposes of determining the safety and effectiveness of a device.\n\nThis document does not address the use of non-clinical data, adverse event reports, secondary use of clinical trial data (e.g., post hoc analyses), or systematic literature reviews. Nor does it address study design/conduct or analytical methodologies. While it does describe the factors that FDA considers when evaluating RWD or RWE, it does not provide a specific set of pass/fail criteria or other scoring tools for making a determination about the suitability of RWD or RWE for a particular regulatory decision.\n\nThis guidance does not affect any federal, state or local laws or regulations, or foreign laws or regulations that may be applicable to the use or collection of RWD, or that provide protections for human subjects (including informed consent requirements) or patient privacy. This guidance should be used to complement, but not supersede, other device-specific and good clinical practice guidance documents.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nTo protect and promote the public health, FDA needs to understand and evaluate the available evidence related to regulated products.1 For medical devices, available evidence is traditionally comprised of non-clinical and, in some cases, clinical studies conducted and provided to FDA by the device manufacturer or sponsor. However, FDA recognizes that a wealth of RWD covering medical device experience exists and is routinely collected in the course of treatment and management of patients. Data collected during clinical care or in the home setting may not have the same quality controls as data collected within a clinical trial setting. Even so, under certain circumstances RWD may be of sufficient quality to help inform or augment FDA's understanding of the benefit-risk profile of devices at various points in their life cycle. RWD, which are typically collected for non-regulatory purposes in EHRs, registries, and administrative and claims data, may provide new insights into the performance and clinical outcomes associated with medical device use. This information can potentially be used by sponsors to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements and to aid FDA in our regulatory decision-making.\n\nFDA has issued guidance documents on premarket and postmarket data collection,2 benefit-risk determinations,3 patient preference information,4 and expedited access to medical devices for unmet medical needs in order to streamline the process for bringing new technologies to market while maintaining the assessment of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of medical devices. FDA has also issued plans for, and has begun implementation of, the National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST)5,6,7,8 to leverage RWD in order to more quickly identify safety problems and to better understand the benefit-risk profile of devices used in clinical care. FDA believes that, if leveraged correctly, the NEST may also help to reduce the time and cost of generating the types of evidence used to support the marketing authorization of FDA-regulated products and to meet postmarket study and reporting requirements.\n\nFootnote 2: Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm393994.pdf).\n\nFootnote 3: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf)\n\nFootnote 4: Patient Preference Information \u2013 Voluntary Submission, Review in Premarket Approval Applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption Applications, and De Novo Requests, and Inclusion in Decision Summaries and Device Labeling (Patient Preference Information \u2013 Voluntary Submission, Review in Premarket Approval Applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption Applications, and De Novo Requests, and Inclusion in Decision Summaries and Devices Labeling\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l} \\hline \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Key:} \\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nDevices are often used in routine clinical practice for uses that are not within their cleared or approved indications for use. However, the knowledge gained from all uses of a device in medical practice is often not realized because the data collected are not systematically characterized, aggregated, and analyzed in a way that can be relied upon to inform regulatory decision-making. By recognizing the value of RWE as an important contributing factor for understanding and regulating medical devices, we hope to encourage the medical community to learn more from routine clinical care than we do today.\n--------------------\nContext title: Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6334632635116577", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations\n\nfor Medical Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry,\n\nClinical Investigators,\n\nInstitutional Review Boards and Food and Drug\n\nAdministration Staff\n\nDocument issued on: November 7, 2021\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on August 15, 2011.\n\nFor questions regarding this document that relate to devices regulated by CDRH, contact Gregory Campbell, PhD at (301) 796-5750 or by email at greg.campbell@fda.hhs.gov, if desired.\n\nFor questions regarding this document that relate to devices regulated by CBER, contact Stephen Ripley at 301-827-6210.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCenter for Biologic Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nWritten comments and suggestions may be submitted at any time for Agency consideration to the Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, (HFA-305), Rockville, MD, 20852.\n\nAdditional Copies\n\nAdditional copies are available from the Internet.

Although the Agency has articulated policies related to design of studies intended to support specific device types, and a general policy of tailoring the evidentiary burden to the regulatory requirement, the Agency has not attempted to describe the different clinical study designs that may be appropriate to support a device pre-market submission, or to define how a sponsor should decide which pivotal clinical study design should be used to support a submission for a particular device. This guidance document describes different study design principles relevant to the development of medical device clinical studies that can be used to fulfill pre-market clinical data requirements. This guidance is not intended to provide a comprehensive tutorial on the best clinical and statistical practices for investigational medical device studies.\n\nMedical devices can undergo three general stages of clinical development. These stages may be extremely dependent on each other and doing a thorough evaluation in one stage can make the next stage much more straightforward. To begin, medical devices may undergo an exploratory clinical stage. In this stage, the limitations and advantages of the medical device are evaluated. This stage includes first-in-human studies and feasibility studies. The next stage, the pivotal stage, is used to develop the information necessary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device for the identified intended use. It usually consists of one or more pivotal studies. Finally, devices undergo a post-market stage which can include an additional study or studies for better understanding of device safety, such as rare adverse events and long-term effectiveness. This guidance provides information on design issues related to pivotal clinical investigations and does not address the other stages in any detail.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA medical device pivotal study is a definitive study in which evidence is gathered to support the safety and effectiveness evaluation of the medical device for its intended use. Evidence from one or more pivotal clinical studies generally serves as the primary basis for the determination of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the medical device of a pre-market approval application (PMA) and FDA's overall benefit-risk determination. In some cases, a PMA may include multiple studies designed to answer different scientific questions.\n\nThe focus of this guidance is providing recommendations to sponsors on how to design clinical investigations to support a PMA. However, sponsors who conduct clinical studies to support pre-market notification (510(k)) and de novo submissions may also rely on the principles in this guidance document.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance describes principles for the design of pre-market clinical studies1 that are pivotal in establishing the safety and effectiveness of a medical device. Practical issues and pitfalls in pivotal clinical study design are discussed, along with their effects on the conclusions that can be drawn from the studies concerning safety and effectiveness. The principles discussed in this guidance are intended to assist sponsors of marketing applications and investigators in designing studies adequate to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness concerning a device.\n\nFootnote 1: For purposes of this guidance the term \u201cstudies\u201d is equivalent to the term \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nTypes of Studies Addressed in this Guidance\n\nDue to the range of intended uses and risks associated with medical devices and constraints in executing clinical studies, this guidance treats pivotal clinical studies in a general manner. It frames FDA's recommendations in terms of two broad categories of medical devices:\n\nTherapeutic and aesthetic devices\n\nDiagnostic devices\n\nFrom this guidance, device developers can gain insight about important pivotal study design issues for devices in each of these categories. At the same time, communication with FDA review staff (e.g., through a pre-submission interaction) is often valuable in arriving at pivotal clinical study designs that are both practical and adequate.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis guidance also includes principles that are applicable to the device-specific issues for combination products defined under 21 CFR Part 3 (e.g., device-drug products; device-biologic products). However, drug-specific or biologic-specific issues that may also be relevant for a combination product are not described in this guidance.\n\nThis guidance is intended to complement other existing guidance, and is not intended to replace the policies described in other guidance documents. In cases where questions arise, consult the appropriate FDA review division directly or the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance and Consumer Assistance or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Communication, Outreach and Development (OCOD) depending on which Center is responsible for review of the device.\n\nTypes of Studies Not Addressed in this Guidance\n\nAlthough this guidance does not address the following kinds of studies, some principles discussed herein are applicable to many of them:\n\nNon-clinical studies (e.g., bench, animal or measurement studies and, for in vitro diagnostic devices, analytical validation studies);\n\nHumanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Regulation: Questions and Answers, at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucml110194.htm, for detailed information.\n\nPre-market feasibility clinical studies, or other pre-market clinical studies that are not part of the pivotal stage;\n\nStudies to establish the clinical validity of companion diagnostic devices (i.e., in vitro diagnostic tests that provide essential information for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product). Clinical development programs for companion diagnostic devices are typically part of the clinical development programs of the corresponding therapeutic products;\n\nPost-market clinical studies. Though the need for post-market clinical studies might arise from interpretation of pre-market clinical results, post-market studies do not drive the initial determination of safety and effectiveness, and their design is not addressed in this guidance. However, the principles discussed in this guidance may be useful in designing such studies;\n\nStudies of products regulated by CBER that require an Investigational New Drug application and Biologics License Application, such as donor screening tests, are not included in the scope of the guidance.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.665444016456604", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF INVESTIGATORS (21 CFR 812.100)\n\nEnsuring that the investigation is conducted according to the signed agreement, the investigational plan, and applicable FDA regulations\n\nProtecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under the investigator's care\n\nControlling devices under investigation\n\nEnsuring that informed consent is obtained from each subject in accordance with 21 CFR Part 50 and that the study is not commenced until FDA and IRB approvals have been obtained.\n\nSPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF INVESTIGATORS (21 CFR 812.110)\n\nAwaiting IRB approval and any necessary FDA approval before requesting written informed consent or permitting subject participation\n\nConducting the investigation in accordance with: 1.

The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor the shipping, use, and final disposal of devices. Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). Investigators must also maintain complete, current, and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of investigational devices (21 CFR 812.140(a)(2)). Specific recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a).\n\nPROHIBITION OF PROMICTION AND OTHER PRACTICES (21 CFR 812.7)\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigator Responsibilities \u2014 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8326706290245056", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Section 3308 of The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA) enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (December 29, 2022) amended section 517A(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

The general expectation is that the stakeholder will follow an orderly progression of interaction with Center employees followed by outreach to relevant members of management and then engagement with the CDRH Ombudsman, prior to filing a formal request for review. However, a stakeholder may file a request for review at any time that is permissible under applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. Additional information about the appeals process is described in the companion guidance entitled, \"Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes: Questions and Answers About 517A - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\"2\n\nFootnote 2: Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes: Questions and Answers About 517A \u2013 Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\u201d available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/center-devices-and-radiolical-health-appals-processes-questions-and-answers-about-517a\n\nThe contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Requests for Supervisory Review (Appeals) under 21 CFR 10.75\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the most effective means for resolving disputes is through discussion and mediation. If these approaches fail to resolve the disagreement, or if an adverse regulatory action is taken, there are several mechanisms available to stakeholders, including hearings, petitions, and requests for supervisory review (appeals). Each of these mechanisms is described in this document. Of these, by far the most commonly used is a request for an appeal. The relevant regulations are provided in 21 CFR 10.75, generally for FDA, and 21 CFR 800.75, specifically for CDRH.\n\nThis section contains guidelines for filing a 10.75 appeal and provides a general description of the review process. Internal agency review is usually the quickest and most efficient means of formally resolving a dispute relating to a CDRH decision. Through this process, the supervisor of a Center employee will, at the request of an interested or aggrieved party, review a decision or action of the employee and issue a decision. The decision rendered by the supervisor, acting as the review authority, customarily takes one of the following forms: overturning the decision of the employee; upholding the employee decision; or, in some circumstances, referring the matter back to the employee for reconsideration under defined conditions. An opportunity may also arise for the review authority to mediate an agreement between the submitter and the employee while the review is in progress, which can be a means for expediting the resolution of the issues in dispute.\n\nSection 517A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act),3 includes requirements pertaining to the process and timelines for 10.75 requests for appeal of \"significant decisions.\" In this guidance, we refer to \"significant decisions\", as set forth in section 517A of the FD&C Act, made by CDRH as \"517A decisions.\" 517A decisions include:\n\nFootnote 3: Section 517A of the FD&C Act was added by section 603 of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012, and subsequently amended by sections 3051 and 3058 of the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016.\n\n510(k) (Premarket Notification): Not Substantially Equivalent; Substantially Equivalent;\n\nPMA/HDE (Premarket Approval / Humanitarian Device Exemption): Not Approvable; Approvable; Approval; Denial;\n\nBreakthrough Device Designation Request (request for breakthrough designation for devices subject to 510(k), PMA, or De Novo classification): Grant; Denial of request for breakthrough designation;\n\nIDE (Investigational Device Exemption): Disapproval; Approval;\n\nFailure to Reach Agreement on a Protocol under Section 520(g)(7) of the FD&C Act; and\n\n\"Clinical Hold\" Determinations under Section 520(g)(8) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn this guidance document, the term \"significant decision\" refers to significant decisions pertaining to 21 CFR 10.75 appeals regarding 510(k)s, applications for PMAs, and applications for IDEs. 517A decisions must comply with the requirements in 21 CFR 800.75(b)(1) in addition to 21 CFR 10.75. For devices reviewed by CDRH, 10.75 appeals of decisions other than 517A decisions must comply with the requirements in 21 CFR 800.75(b)(2) in addition to 21 CFR 10.75. FDA provides further guidance on 517A and 21 CFR 800.75 in a companion guidance document entitled \"Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes: Questions and Answers about 517A - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\"4\n\nFootnote 4: Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes: Questions and Answers About 517A \u2013 Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\u201d available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/center-devices-and-radiolical-health-appals-processes-questions-and-answers-about-517a\n\n1 General Considerations\n\n(1) Supervisory Review (Appeal) Hierarchy\n\nA request for an appeal should be directed to the next organizational level above the level at which the decision was made. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the signatory of the decision under dispute so that the request can be directed to the appropriate review authority. The organizational hierarchy varies across the Center, but in general the order is Division of Health Technology (DHT) (\\rightarrow) Office of Health Technology (OHT) (\\rightarrow) Office of Product Evaluation and Quality (OPEQ) (\\rightarrow) Center (\\rightarrow) Commissioner. For example, a Not Substantially Equivalent (NSE) decision for a 510(k) submission typically is signed by a DHT Division Director, so a request for an appeal would be directed to the relevant OHT Office Director. Note that the review authority may designate their authority to another supervisor with the appropriate decision-making authority.\n\nDecisions rendered at the Center level may be further appealed to the Commissioner's Office. A request for review by the Commissioner's Office of a decision made at the Center level generally takes the form of a petition or appeal under 21 CFR Part 10 as described elsewhere in this document. As a matter of general practice, the Agency expects that available options for review up to the Center Director, such as under 21 CFR 10.75, will have been exhausted before a petition is filed with the Commissioner, although in certain cases time frames for preserving an appeal might mandate filing of an appeal to the Commissioner before exhaustion of Center-level review remedies.5 However, nothing in this guidance should be construed as constraining the ability of a stakeholder to exercise options for appeal or petition at any time that is permissible under applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.\n--------------------\nContext title: Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.4704411029815674", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Note: Seizure only may be applied to electronic products that are also adulterated or misbranded medical devices.\nD. FEDERAL/STATE RELATIONS\n\nSome states have Radiation Control Programs within the State Health Department or Department of Environmental Health, which may have adopted portions of the EPRC requirements into their radiation safety regulations.\n\nORA Divisions should use all reasonable means available to encourage voluntary conformance of products with the performance standard regardless of the date of manufacture. It is recommended that the ORA Divisions coordinate regulatory activity with appropriate state representatives through the RHR (Radiological Health Representative) and OP (Office of Partnerships) particularly where local authority may assist in achieving correction of a deficiency. This may be particularly useful to address issues related to product use where the State may have regulatory authority, which extends beyond FDA authority to regulate the design, production or manufacture of the product.\nE. MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATORY/ADMINISTRATIVE FOLLOW-UP\n\nRegulatory follow-up for joint EPRC/quality systems inspections can be handled separately or in combination at the discretion of the ORA Division and CDRH. Refer to Part V in Compliance Program 7382.845, Quality System/GMP Regulatory/Administrative Follow-Up, for guidance on regulatory actions related to radiation-emitting medical devices. Enforcement actions on radiation-emitting medical device firms, which also include EPRC violations, require CDRH concurrence before implementation by the field.

The radiation emitted from these laser products can pose varying degrees of hazards depending upon the type, magnitude, and accessibility of the radiation and upon the particular functions or operations they perform. The standard was last amended in 1985. Since then, the CDRH has intended to harmonize the requirements of the standard with those of the international standard IEC 60825-1: 2001. As an interim step the CDRH published its Laser Notice 50 in 2001, and updated in 2007 to include IEC 60825-1:2007 and IEC 60601-2-22, stating that it would not object to compliance with specified requirements of the international standards in lieu of comparable requirements of the CDRH standard. Additionally, CDRH has published Laser Notices 56 in May of 2019, in which CDRH has intended to harmonize requirements of the standard those of IEC 60825-1: 2014. Check the list of Notices to the Laser Industry for any updates: https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-\n\nEmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/HomeBusinessandEntertainment/LaserProductsandInstruments/ucm116422.htm.\n\n2 Specific Instructions\n\nHigh-risk laser products and their manufacturers should be inspected or tested as a priority. Examples of high-risk laser products and manufacturers include:\n\nClass IIIb/3B and IV/4 medical lasers (e.g. surgical laser)\n\nClass IIIb/3B and IV/4 industrial lasers used in material processing\n\nClass IIIb/3B and IV/4 lasers used in law enforcement or military applications\n\nManufacturers with known or suspected problems based on previous inspection, field tests or complaints\n\nManufacturers introducing new technology to the US market (The firm's website or CDRH staff may identify a new product as featuring a breakthrough in technology)\n\nManufacturers with a large portion of the US market share for any laser product. However, manufacturers of Class I low risk laser products, such as optical disk drives or laser printers, should not be inspected or tested. Class I industrial products with high-power embedded lasers are made in small quantities and can be considered high risk.\n\nNew manufacturers not yet inspected\n--------------------\nContext title: CPGM 7386.001\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.6675221920013428"], "Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: Q4:: A packaging site will be added that will enclose two sample cartons, along with some promotional material, into a larger carton or box preprinted with the product name:\n\nDoes the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n\nIs the tertiary site held to the same CGMP requirements as a secondary site? For example, if a tertiary site should be submitted to the agency, and this site has not had any CGMP inspection within the last two years, is this change still annual reportable?\n\nA4: The guidance only distinguishes between primary and secondary packaging sites. The site described would be considered a secondary packaging site. CGMP requirements extend beyond packaging and repackaging operations that involve direct product contact. For example, a site must register with FDA (21 CFR Part 207) and is subject to CGMP inspection (21 CFR Part 211) when the site is used to attach inserts, or in the case of a cartoning site, when cartons contain product labels. If registration and/or inspection are required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, CDER should be notified of the different site (via the application). The site should have a satisfactory inspection relating to packaging operations for notification to occur in the annual report. For the purposes of this guidance, in general, there is no two-year limit on the CGMP inspection (see Manufacturing Sites Q10). If registration and inspection are not required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, the applicant need not notify CDER of the site. If you have any questions on whether this packaging operation is subject to FDA registration or inspection, you should contact the appropriate CDER inspection and/or compliance staff for advice.\n\nQ5:: Certain changes relating to contract sterilization sites for packaging components can be reported in an annual report (section VI.D.4). Does this also apply to applicant owned sites?\n\nA5: Yes. Whether the sterilization site is applicant- or contractor-owned, a change to a different sterilization site for packaging components can be reported in an annual report when the process is not materially different from the process described in the approved application, and the facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation that is being performed.\n\nQ6:: Should a prior approval supplement be submitted for a change in the sterilization site for a primary packaging component of a metered dose inhaler?\n\nA6: The change can be reported in an annual report as long as the process is not materially different from that provided for in the approved application and as long as the facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being performed (section VI.D.4)\n\nQ7: If an intermediate or starting material is also a drug substance, would the recommendations on reporting site changes for intermediates or drug substances apply?\n\nA7: If a drug substance is used as an intermediate in a drug substance manufacturing process, the guidance on intermediates would apply. This assumes that the material has been classified appropriately as an intermediate (see relevant definitions in the glossary of the guidance). CDER traditionally does not consider a drug substance to be a starting material.\n\nQ8: Do the recommendations for manufacturing site changes apply to manufacturing sites outside the United States as long as the site has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation that will be moved?\n\nA8: Yes. The recommendations in the guidance apply to domestic and foreign manufacturing sites.\n\nQ9: The site where the certificates of analysis and regulatory documentation are reviewed prior to commercial distribution of the product will be relocated. Should this site change be reported in the application?\n\nA9: A change in the site where GMP support paperwork operations occur need not be reported in the application.\n\nQ10: The guidance (section VI.B.2) states that a manufacturing site change should be submitted in a prior approval supplement if the new manufacturing site does not have a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being moved. In previous guidances it was stated that a satisfactory CGMP inspection within the last two years was needed. Should a prior approval supplement be used if the new facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being moved, but the inspection occurred more than two years ago?\n\nA10: For the purposes of the guidance, there is no time limit on the satisfactory CGMP inspection unless the type of operation was discontinued (section VI.B.1).\n\nQ11: What is the reporting category for a change to a different manufacturing site for an excipient?\n\nA11: CDER need not be notified of this type of change.\n\nQ12: What is the recommended reporting category for the addition of a new aseptic filling line for sterile products?* The addition of a new aseptic filling line should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VI.B.4).\n* Why does the guidance exclude drug substance intermediates when referring to satisfactory CGMP inspections?\n* Section 510(a)(2)(B) of the Act requires that all drugs be manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs. No distinction is made between the manufacture of drug substance and drug product. Although the CGMP regulations under 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 apply only to drug products, FDA expects appropriate CGMPs to be applied to all steps of a drug substance manufacturing process beginning with the use of starting materials. The types of sites identified in the guidance are routinely subject to FDA inspection with the exception of those facilities or establishments used to manufacture or process drug substance intermediates. Drug substance intermediate manufacturing or processing sites are not exempt from inspection, but an inspection is generally discretionary. Moreover, this type of facility is always subject to for cause inspection. Because drug substance intermediate sites are not routinely inspected, a satisfactory CGMP inspection was not included as a condition for submitting the change in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days or annual report. However, when a drug substance intermediate manufacturing or processing site has been inspected and the CGMP inspection was not satisfactory, the change in site should be submitted as a prior approval supplement.\n\nManufacturing Process\n\nAn applicant intends to add a coarse screen to the opening of a blender, through which all individual components of a granulation would pass prior to granulation. The applicant asks whether this could be considered a change in a control which would be reportable in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section VII.C.2.a of the guidance.\n\nThis change is not considered a change in control but an additional step in the manufacturing process. However, it is not considered a fundamental change in the manufacturing process. This type of change should be reported in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (section VII.C.1.a).\n\nCan changes in mixing steps and elimination of a mixing step be reported in an annual report if these changes are implemented prior to the manufacture of validation batches?\n\nThe timing of the postapproval change (i.e., pre- or post validation batches) does not affect the recommended reporting category. The type of change should be submitted in either a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (e.g., VIII.C.1.a.) or prior approval supplement (e.g., VII.B.1) depending on the specifics of each situation such as the type of dosage form.\n\nWhat is the recommended reporting category for a drug product (immediate release solid oral dosage form) scale change beyond 10 times the size of the biobatch? If the change is annual reportable, should the information identified in SUPAC-IR3 for a Level 1 scale change be submitted?\n\nAll changes in the scale of the nonprotein drug product manufacturing batches can be reported in an annual report (see section VII.D.1.a).4 However, if the scale change results in other changes (e.g., equipment, process), the change would be considered a multiple change, and the recommended reporting category should be the most restrictive of those for any of the individual changes (section XII). Recommendations on scale changes for protein drug products are included in section VII.C.1.c and VII.D.1.a of the guidance. Footnote 4: The reporting categories in the Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA guidance supersede those recommended in SUPAC guidances where there are inconsistencies. Therefore, the recommendations in SUPAC-IR that certain scale changes be submitted in supplements are superseded.\n\nSPECifications\n\nQ1: How should a revision of an analytical procedure be reported to allow for the use of a company (i.e., secondary) standard in addition to the U. S. Pharmacopeia (USP) standard?\n\nA1: The revision of an analytical procedure to allow the option to use a secondary standard should be reported in an annual report. Also, the laboratory reference standards used must comply with CGMP regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 211.194(c)). Q2: How should a decrease in the fill volume be reported?\n\nA2: A change in the fill volume of a drug product involves a change to the specification and must be submitted in a prior approval supplement unless exempted by regulation or guidance (506A(c)(2)(A) of the Act). There is no exemption for this type of specification change; therefore, a prior approval supplement should be submitted. Q3: What reporting category should be used if a USP HPLC assay procedure replaces, or is used in addition to, a microbiological assay that is listed in the approved specification as the regulatory analytical procedure?\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 8.383594512939453", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

If these planned modifications fit within the scope (e.g., same type of change(s)) of the original CP submission, they must be submitted in an annual report:\n\nAny change to a characterization test or study, analytical procedure, or acceptance criteria to be achieved as specified in an approved CP that is made to comply with an official compendium and that does not relax an acceptance criterion or delete a test,\n\nTightening of acceptance criteria to be achieved for a characterization test or study,\n\nAn approved change in the information within the application that is referenced in an approved CP, and\n\nEditorial changes to an approved CP.\n\nThis section of the guidance has a binding effect with regard to submitting such modifications to an approved CP in a CBE-30 supplement, CBE-0 supplement, or annual report rather than a PAS.\n\nFor tracking purposes, FDA recommends that a submission proposing modifications to an approved CP include a reference to the previously approved original application or PAS supplement containing the CP. The appropriate FDA review division can be contacted for questions regarding proposed modifications to an approved CP for a specific product.42\n\nFootnote 42: For questions about a CP submitted to an approved NDA, ANDA, or BLA in CDER, contact the Regulatory Business Process Manager in OPQ for the specific product. For questions about a CP submitted to a BLA, NDA, or ANDA in CBER, contact the Regulatory Project Manager in the product office for the specific product.\n\nVI Implementation of CMC Changes According to an Approved Comparability Protocol\n\nWhen making a CMC change(s) in accordance with an approved CP, you should review the initial risk assessment associated with making the change(s) provided in the approved CP and compare it with your current understanding of the product and manufacturing process to ensure that the outcomes of that risk assessment as they pertain to the planned change(s) remain valid. If your review of the risk assessment indicates a substantive difference in the previously described level of risk associated with making the change, either higher or lower, this may affect the reporting category for the change(s) specified in the approved CP. In this case, we recommend that you contact the appropriate FDA review division to discuss an appropriate course of action, which may include modification of the CP, the approved reporting category, or both. In addition, you should confirm that your control strategy will continue to ensureconsistent production of product of acceptable quality after implementing the change(s). The change(s) outlined in the approved CP should be implemented within your change management system as part of your overall pharmaceutical quality system.43 In addition, the change(s) must be approved by your quality control unit.44 Upon completion of the plan for successful implementation of the change(s) as described in the approved CP (including achievement of all of the predefined acceptance criteria), the change(s), if implemented, must be submitted to FDA using the reporting category specified in the approved CP submission.45\n\nFootnote 43: See ICH Q10, section II.B.\n\nFootnote 44: See footnote 17.\n\nFDA realizes that minor deviations from the approved CP may occur during implementation. Such deviations should not affect the technical principles of the protocol, should be addressed by the risk assessment, and should not affect product quality or the approved reporting category. You should evaluate whether the CP needs to be modified (see section V).\n\nYou are responsible for ensuring that the facility(ies) where the change(s) is to be made is capable of implementing the change(s) in accordance with CGMP. If any impacted facility is not capable of implementing the change(s) in accordance with CGMP, the approved CP should not be implemented at those facilities.46\n\nFootnote 45: See 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12.\n\nFootnote 46: In the case where a manufacturing change is needed to correct a CGMP deficiency, we recommend that you contact the appropriate FDA review division regarding how to proceed.\n\nIn addition, CGMP observations that raise concern regarding the effectiveness of a facility's pharmaceutical quality system, and change management in particular, may lead to a need to modify previously approved CP reporting categories until the pharmaceutical quality system effectiveness has returned to an acceptable state. For example, inspection observations that lead to classifying a facility as Official Action Indicated (OAI) would generally impact an approved CP. In these cases, FDA intends to communicate with facilities and applicants, as appropriate, any CP reporting category modifications that are necessary based on CGMP observations, which may include reverting to the reporting categories that would apply in the absence of the approved CP.47\n\nFootnote 47: See 37.\n\nYou should collect and analyze commercial scale data, except where less than commercial scale data is justified,48 to determine whether the change(s) has been successfully implemented in accordance with the approved CP.\n\nFootnote 47: See 37.\n\nData demonstrates criteria have been achieved\n\nIf the data derived from the tests and studies demonstrate that the approved acceptance criteria in the CP have been achieved, the product manufactured by the new process can be distributed once the provisions of the approved reporting category are satisfied (e.g., if a PAS, after approval is obtained; if CBE-30, 30 days after notification; if CBE-0, upon notification; if an annual report, distribution can commence immediately).49\n\nFootnote 49: In addition to satisfying the provisions of the approved reporting category, successful completion of Stage 2 process validation is also necessary before commercial distribution (see 21 CFR 211.22, 211.100, and 211.165). See also guidance for industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices (January 2011).\n\nFollowing implementation of the change(s), you must continue monitoring the process performance and product quality in accordance with CGMP requirements to ensure that a state of control is maintained.50 Written records, including records containing the data associated with implementing the change(s), must be retained in accordance with CGMP requirements (see 21 CFR 211.180(e)). These records (or copies of such records), including the raw data therein, must be available during the retention period51 for FDA to review during an inspection under section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or when requested by FDA in advance of or in lieu of an inspection as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. The data should be incorporated as part of your systematic approach to knowledge management52 to inform future product and process development.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 211.100. See also the recommendations in ICH Q10.\n\nData demonstrates criteria have not been achieved\n\nIf the data derived from the tests and studies demonstrate that the approved acceptance criteria in the CP have not been achieved or there is an otherwise unwanted, unintended, or unpredicted outcome that affects product quality,53 product manufactured by the altered process must not be distributed.54\n\nFootnote 54: See section 704 of the FD&C Act, and 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12.\n\nIf you wish to pursue such a change using a CP, FDA recommends that you contact the appropriate FDA review division to discuss an appropriate course of action, which may include modification of the proposed change(s) as well as the risk assessment, the CP for the change, and the reporting category. Alternatively, you may choose to pursue such a change without using a CP; in that case, the proposed change(s) must be reported using the applicable reporting categories established in 21 CFR 314.70 or 601.12.55 If you determine that an approved CP will not be used to make a change, FDA recommends that you request withdrawal of the approved CP in a CBE-0 supplement to your application.\n\nFootnote 52: See ICH Q10.\n\nFootnote 53: For example, differences are observed in product quality attributes between the pre-change and post-change products and the impact on safety and/or efficacy profiles of the product cannot be excluded without performing a nonclinical safety, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, or clinical safety or efficacy study to assess the effects of the change(s) (e.g., see ICH Q5E).\n\nFootnote 54: See section 506A(b) of the FD&C Act, and 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12.\n\nFootnote 55: See footnote 31.\n\n6 Reporting CMC Changes Made in Accordance with an Approved Comparability Protocol\n\nAs required by 21 CFR 314.70, you must notify FDA about each change in each condition established in the approved application beyond the variations already provided for in the application. You must notify FDA about these changes in a supplement or annual report as described in 21 CFR 314.70(b)-(d). As required by 21 CFR 601.12, you must inform FDA about each change in the product, production process, quality controls, equipment, facilities, responsible personnel, or labeling established in the approved license application(s).\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1738508939743042", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

An applicant has the option to submit one or more CPs describing the specific tests, validation studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved in order to demonstrate the lack of adverse effect(s) for specified types of manufacturing changes on product quality. A CP shall be submitted as a PAS requiring approval from the FDA before distribution of a product made using the change outlined in the protocol. If approved, the CP may justify a less burdensome reporting category for the particular change (Ref. [9]).21 A less burdensome reporting category should be requested and approved by FDA as part of the CP.\n\nFootnote 21: 21 CFR 601.12 (e).\n\nAfter a CP is approved, an applicant may introduce changes to the CP. Under 21 CFR 601.12(e), such changes shall be submitted as a PAS (major change). Notwithstanding this requirement, as provided in 21 CFR 601.12(a)(3), to make CPs more useful and flexible, FDA may provide for a less burdensome notification of certain types of modifications to an approved CP.22 Footnote 22: 21 CFR 601.12(a) and (e).\n\nA CP may be submitted for a single, or multiple related changes, and may cover a single or multiple BLAs (i.e., a \"trans-BLA\"). Submission and approval of a CP may enable:\n\ngreater predictability regarding the timing of implementation of CMC changes;\n\nplacing the product into distribution sooner than without the use of a protocol; and\n\nmore effective planning of the product supply chain.\n\nRecommendations for Reporting Categories\n\nThe FDA reviews manufacturing changes reported across licensed biological products within the scope of this guidance using the tiered reporting system23 described in section IV.A. of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 23: 21 CFR 601.12.\n\nIn the Appendix of this guidance, a table of frequent manufacturing changes and recommended reporting categories is provided. It is meant to serve as a guide to assist applicants and the FDA to identify reportable post-approval changes and determine appropriate reporting categories. It is based, in part, upon our overall assessment of the potential risks to process performance and product quality caused by the change. This assessment is supported by the Agency's accumulated experience resulting from inspections and reviews of post-approval manufacturing changes. The recommendations for reporting categories provided in the Appendix should be read to determine the appropriate category for the specific manufacturing change(s) under consideration. This table does not represent an exhaustive list of possible reportable manufacturing changes; a manufacturing change may still be considered reportable even if not listed in the table.\n\nAlthough the selection of a reporting category for a change generally should be made in accordance with the recommendations provided in this guidance, a different selection may in some instances be determined to be appropriate, provided it complies with applicable regulatory requirements. Early consultation with the FDA is recommended to determine the appropriate reporting category for manufacturing change(s) not described in the table in the Appendix, or when considering an adjustment to the recommended reporting categories. The Agency will make a decision regarding the reporting category based upon available information and the Agency's current thinking.\n\nSome manufacturing changes may be reported in multiple categories, depending upon the type and extent of the change and its potential effects. When considering the correct reporting category for a submission, the applicant should ensure that the highest risk change determines the reporting category that is chosen for the submission. For example, there may be several moderate-risk changes associated with one major risk change, in which case the reporting category for the highest risk change may define the appropriate submission type (e.g., PAS).\n\nWhen multiple changes are made to a process, it may be appropriate to consider the cumulative impact of all changes, which may lead to a higher reporting category.\n\nWe recommend, if an applicant includes multiple changes in one supplement, that all of the changes in the supplement be somehow related or pertain to a similar step in the manufacturing process (e.g., changes associated with an increase in a production scale, or multiple changes made to a purification process). While the inclusion of multiple related changes in one supplement may result in a higher reporting category proportionate to the change with the highest risk as well as cumulative impact of all changes, this approach is expected to provide a comprehensive assessment of the combined effect of all changes onprocess performance and product quality. Inclusion of multiple unrelated changes in one submission, even those in the same reporting category, could result in a potential delay in implementing all of the changes (e.g., approximability of any single change may affect approximability of all the changes included in the supplement).\n\nV Special Considerations\n\nChange in Process Parameters\n\nProcess parameters (operating and performance) are frequently adjusted over a product's lifecycle. Additional knowledge and experience about material attributes, operating and performance parameters, and the way their interaction affects product quality and process performance typically enable a more informed risk assessment and risk ranking. Any change to process parameters (operating or performance) outside of an approved validated range(s) should be evaluated with respect to criticality, impact on process performance and product quality, and effectiveness of the overall control strategy and must be reported to FDA.24 The reporting category selected should be commensurate with the risk of an unintended outcome resulting from changes involving these elements.\n\nFootnote 24: 21 CFR 601.12.\n\nChange in a Supplier of Raw Materials\n\nWe recommend the following manufacturing changes be reported in a PAS:\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials that have a substantial potential to affect product quality, including inactivation, detoxification, immunization in the production of hyperimmune plasma, or conjugation (e.g., PEG, acridinium ester, biotin, beads); and\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials that have a substantial potential to affect product quality, including an ability to maintain specified pH or ionic strength in the manufacture of plasma-derived fractionated products (e.g., phosphate, tris, ethanol).\n\nWe recommend the following manufacturing changes be reported in a CBE30:\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials used to aid in filtration (e.g., celite, diatomaceous earth, activated carbon); or\n\nA change in a supplier of trypsin or serum used in the manufacture of viral vaccine products.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe recommend the following manufacturing change be reported in an AR:\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials that have a minimal potential to affect product quality, provided that the materials' specific use, physicochemical properties, impurity content, and acceptance criteria remain unchanged.\n\nMiscellaneous changes not specified in Appendix\n\nThe Appendix contains examples for the types of manufacturing changes most commonly seen by FDA and is not intended to be comprehensive. If you plan to implement a manufacturing change that is not covered in the Appendix, it is your responsibility to perform a risk assessment to determine the appropriate reporting category and to contact the appropriate FDA Review Division if you have questions.\n\nVI Glossary\n\nAcceptance Criteria - Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures which the Drug Substance or Drug Product or materials at other stages of their manufacture should meet (Ref. [16]).\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application- Certain Biological Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.4895477294921875", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: A secondary packaging component generally serves one or more of the following additional functions:\n\nProvides protection from excessive transmission of moisture or solvents into or out of the packaging system\n\nProvides protection from excessive transmission of reactive gases (atmospheric oxygen, inert headspace filler gas, or other organic vapors) into or out of the packaging system\n\nProvides light protection for the packaging system\n\nProvides protection for a packaging system that is flexible or needs extra protection from rough handling\n\nProvides an additional measure of microbiological protection (i.e., by maintaining sterility or by protecting the packaging system from microbial intrusion)\n\nWhen information on a container closure system is submitted in an application, the emphasis would normally be on the primary packaging components. For a secondary packaging component, a brief description will usually suffice unless the component is intended to provide some additional measure of protection to the drug product. In this case, more complete information should be provided, along with data showing that the secondary packaging component actually provides the additional protection (see sections III.B.1 and III.B.2).\n\nBecause secondary packaging components are not intended to make contact with the dosage form, there is usually less concern regarding the materials from which they are constructed. However, if the packaging system is relatively permeable, the possibility increases that the dosage form could be contaminated by the migration of an ink or adhesive component, or from a volatile substance present in the secondary packaging component. (For example, a solution packaged in a LDPE container was found to be contaminated by a volatile constituent of the secondary packaging components that enclosed it.). In such a case, the secondary packaging component should be considered a potential source of contamination and the safety of its materials of construction should be taken into consideration.\n\nInformation That Should Be Submitted in Support of an Original Application for Any Drug Product15\n\nAdditional discussion and information regarding the CMC information to be provided in an application (NDA, ANDA, or BLA) can be found in the guidances and guidelines listed in Attachment E.\n\nFootnote 15: See Table 3 for additional information. This section applies to primary packaging components and to those associated and secondary packaging components that provide protection to the drug product or for which there may be a safety concern (see section III.B).\n\nDescription A general description of the entire container closure system should be provided in the CMC section of the application. In addition, the following information should be provided by the applicant for each individual component of the packaging system: 1. Identification by product name, product code (if available), the name and address of the manufacturer, and a physical description of the packaging component (e.g., type, size, shape, and color) 2. Identification of the materials of construction (i.e., plastics, paper, metal, glass, elastomers, coatings, adhesives, and other such materials) should be identified by a specific product designation (code name and/or code number) and the source (name of the manufacturer).16 Alternate materials of construction should also be indicated. Postconsumer recycled plastic should not be used in the manufacture of a primary packaging component. If used for a secondary or associated component, then the safety and compatibility of the material for its intended use should be addressed appropriately. 3. Description of any operations or preparations that are performed on a packaging component by the applicant (such as washing, coating, sterilization, or depyrogenation)17\n\nFootnote 17: For further information see the FDA guidance for industry Submission of Documentation for the Sterilization Process Validation in Applications of Human and Veterinary Drug Products (November 1994).\n\nInformation About SuitabilityTo establish safety and to ensure consistency, the complete chemical composition should be provided for every material used in the manufacture of a packaging component.\n\nTest results from appropriate qualification and characterization tests should be provided. Adequate information regarding the tests, methods, acceptance criteria, reference standards, and validation information should be provided.\n\nTo address protection, use of USP tests (see Attachment A) for light transmission, moisture permeation, microbial limits, and sterility are generally considered sufficient. Testing for properties other than those described in USP (e.g., gas transmission, solvent leakage container integrity) may also be necessary.\n\nTo address safety and compatibility, the results of extraction/toxicological evaluation studies should be provided for drug products that are likely to interact with the packaging components and introduce extracted substances into the patient (see Table 1). For drug products less likely to interact, other tests (e.g., USP Biological Reactivity Test) or information (e.g., appropriate reference to the indirect food additive regulations at 21 CFR 174-186) could be used to address the issue of safety and compatibility (see Table 2). For example, an appropriate reference to an indirect food additive regulation is generally sufficient for a solid oral dosage form product.\n\nTo address performance, the results of USP and non-USP functionality tests are considered sufficient if the test and acceptance criteria are appropriate for the intended purpose.\n\nTests described in the USP are typically considered sufficient standards for establishing specified properties and characteristics of specified materials of construction or packaging components.\n\nFor non-USP tests, an applicant should provide justification for the use of the test, a complete and detailed description of how the test was performed, and an explanation of what the test is intended to establish. If a related USP test is available, comparative data should be provided using both methods. Supporting data should include a demonstration of the suitability of the test for its intended use and its validation.\n\nTesting on an assembled container closure system is usually performed by the applicant (or a testing laboratory commissioned by the applicant) and the test results provided in the application. Such tests may include vacuum leak testing, moisture permeation, and weight loss or media fill. Testing on an individual packaging component is typically performed by the manufacturer of the component and reported via a DMF (see section V).\n\nInformation About Quality Control\n\nThe fabricator/manufacturer of a packaging component and the drug product manufacturer who uses this firm share the responsibility for ensuring the quality of packaging components. These firms should have a quality control program in place so that consistent components are produced. The drug product manufacturer must have an inspection program for incoming packaging components and materials (21 CFR 211.22, 211.84 and 211.122). For most drug products, a drug product manufacturer may accept a packaging component lot based on receiving a Certificate of Analysis (COA) or Certificate of Certification (COC) from the component supplier and the performance of an appropriate identification test, provided the supplier's test data are periodically validated (21 CFR 211.84(d)(3)). Acceptance of a packaging component lot based on a supplier's COA or COC may not be appropriate in all cases (e.g., some packaging components for certain inhalation drug products).\n\na. Applicants\n\nThe tests and methods used by the applicant for acceptance of each batch of a packaging component that they receive should be described. If a batch is to be accepted based on a supplier's COA or COC, then the procedure for supplier validation should be described. The data from the supplier's COA or COC should clearly indicate that the lot meets the applicant's acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria for extractables should also be included, if appropriate.\n\nDimensional and performance criteria should be provided. Dimensional information is frequently provided via a detailed schematic drawing complete with target dimensions and tolerances and may be provided via the packaging component manufacturer's DMF. A separate drawing may not be necessary if the packaging component is part of a larger unit for which a drawing is provided or if the component is uncomplicated in design (e.g., a cap liner).\n\nb. Manufacturers of Packaging Components Sold to Drug ProductEach manufacturer of a packaging component sold to a drug product manufacturer should provide a description of the quality control measures used to maintain consistency in the physical and chemical characteristics of the component. These generally include release criteria (and test methods, if appropriate) and a description of the manufacturing procedure. If the release of the packaging component is based on statistical process control,18 a complete description of the process (including control criteria) and its validation should be provided.\n\nFootnote 18: Statistical process control is defined as \u201d[t]he application of statistical techniques for measuring and analyzing the variation in processes.\u201d Juran, J.M., ed., 1988, Quality Control Handbook, 4th ed., McGraw-Hill, p. 24.2.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing process is generally brief and should include any operations performed on the packaging component after manufacture but prior to shipping (e.g., washing, coating, and/or sterilization). In some cases it may be desirable for the description to be more detailed and to include in-process controls.\n\nThis information may be provided via a DMF (see section V).\n\nManufacturers of Materials of Construction or of Packaging Components Used to Make Other Packaging Components\n--------------------\nContext title: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.06458854675293", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

The signed and dated pathology report (raw data)4 is critical in facilitating a thorough review of the toxicologic potential of a specific investigational product.\n\nFootnote 4: The final rule, \u201cGood Laboratory Practice Regulations,\u201d published September 4, 1987 (21 CFR Part 58).\n\nTesting facility management should implement appropriate measures to ensure that the conduct of all phases of GLP toxicology studies, including the generation of the pathology report, is free from undue influence impacting the conclusions of the studies. Regarding pathology peer review, the independence of both the study pathologist and the peer-review pathologist(s) throughout the process should be ensured by both the management of the nonclinical testing facility and the sponsor or the applicant. Measures to ensure transparency can include, among other options, the implementation of an audit trail, or conducting contemporaneous peer review after the study pathologist's diagnoses are fixed or locked in an electronic system.\n\nDiverging diagnoses, interpretations, or conclusions between the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s) should be addressed using a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (see Q9).\n\nQ9: How are differences in interpretation that result from pathology peer review addressed?\n\nA9: If no resolution of differences in diagnoses and interpretations can be reached during pathology peer review, the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist should carefully follow a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (i.e., SOPs, study protocol, or study protocol amendment) for addressing diagnostic and interpretative differences during pathology peer review.\n\nDepending upon the directives of the written procedures, consensus could be achieved through consultation with additional experienced pathologists (e.g., PWG). Records of communications pertinent to differences of opinion relevant to the pathology peer review, including but not limited to records of meetings (e.g., meeting minutes), should be retained in the study file. Adherence to written procedures should be documented. Consensus diagnoses and interpretations should be documented in a report (e.g., PWG report) separate from the study pathologist's report and should be appended to the final study report.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.616940498352051", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: III Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What constitutes pathology peer review?\n\nA1: Pathology peer review is the process by which the diagnoses and interpretations of the pathologist assigned to a study (study pathologist) are subjected to review by one or more peer-review pathologist(s) or a PWG. Pathology peer review can help to ensure the quality and accuracy of histopathological diagnoses and interpretations.\n\nCausal discussions, opinion exchange, and mentoring among pathologists do not constitute pathology peer review and are not covered by this guidance document.\n\nQ2: Who should conduct a pathology peer review?\n\nA2: A peer-review pathologist should have a combination of appropriate education, training, and experience to be qualified to render opinions on the study pathologist's histological descriptions. It can be beneficial for a peer-review pathologist to have experience with the route of administration, contact type and duration of the test article, species and strains of animals being tested, and duration and design of the study. It can also be beneficial for a peer-review pathologist to have knowledge of the mechanism of action of the test article and knowledge of the results of test article administration at other dose levels or in other species.\n\nQ3: When can pathology peer review occur?\n\nA3: Pathology peer review can occur before finalization (contemporaneous) or after finalization (retrospective) of the study pathologist's report (i.e., signed and dated pathology report). Pathology peer review that occurs before finalization of the study pathologist's report is considered contemporaneous peer review. When pathology peer review occurs before the finalization of the study pathologist's report, the study pathologist should prepare a written narrative that describes the diagnoses and interpretations of available slides before the contemporaneous peer review occurs.\n\nPathology peer review that occurs after finalization of the pathology report is considered retrospective peer review. When pathology peer review occurs retrospectively, the study pathologist should document any changes to the diagnoses and interpretations that result from the retrospective peer-review process in an amendment to the pathology report. When pathology peer review occurs after the final study report is signed, the study director should amend the final study report as necessary to reflect changes in histopathology diagnoses and interpretations.\n\nQ4: How should pathology peer review be documented, and what should be included in the peer-review statement?\n\nA4: It is important that the peer-review process be well documented and transparent. When either a contemporaneous or a retrospective pathology peer review is part of a GLP toxicology study, the activity should be included in the study protocol or protocol amendment. The process should be guided by written procedures to establish the extent of the review and ensure the integrity of the study. Because the study pathologist is responsible for the overall pathology data, the pathology report will reflect the study pathologist's best scientific opinion and judgment regarding the diagnoses and pathological interpretations.\n\nPathology peer review should be planned, conducted, documented, and reported in accordance with established written procedures. These written procedures should be available to the peer-review pathologist(s) prior to the initiation of peer review as SOPs, or in the study protocol or study-protocol amendment.\n\nThe peer-review pathologist(s) should generate a signed and dated peer-review statement (document, report, memorandum, or certificate) for inclusion in the final study report. All peer-review pathologists' signature blocks (identity and affiliation) should be included in the peer-review statement that is contained in the final study report.\n\nThe peer-review statement should be signed and dated by the peer-review pathologist(s) and include the following information:\n\nWho performed the peer-review and the date(s) it was performed\n\nWhether the peer-review was performed contemporaneously or retrospectively\n\nWhether the peer-review was conducted in compliance with GLP regulations\n\nWhat tissues were examined microscopically, corresponding animal identification number, dose/treatment group, and the basis for their selection\n\nWhat format (e.g., glass slides or whole slide images) was used_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nWhether the terminology, diagnoses, and interpretations used in the pathology report were agreed upon by both the study and peer-review pathologist(s)\n\nWhether a narrative report prepared by the study pathologist was reviewed either prior to or during peer review (for contemporaneous review only)\n\nWhat data and documents were utilized during the peer review (a listing)\n\nIf the peer-review pathologist concurs with the diagnoses and interpretations of the study pathologist, the peer-review statement might not include a comprehensive analysis of the outcome of the peer review. Under these conditions, sponsors or applicants can submit a statement explaining that a peer review was conducted, and the final pathology report reflects the consensus opinions of the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s). If no resolution of differences in diagnoses and interpretations can be reached during pathology peer review, the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist should carefully follow a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (i.e., SOPs, study protocol, or study protocol amendment) for addressing diagnostic and interpretative differences during pathology peer review (as discussed further in Q9).\n\nAny changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a contemporaneous peer review do not need to be documented in the study pathology report, as contemporaneous peer review is considered part of the iterative diagnostic pathology process. Any changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a retrospective peer-review should be documented in the peer-review statement and in an amendment to the study pathologist's report.\n\nQ5: Can pathology peer review for a GLP toxicology study be conducted at a site that does not have an established quality system that complies with GLP regulations?\n\nA5: Yes, it is possible to conduct the pathology peer review for a GLP toxicology study at a site that does not have an established quality system that complies with GLP regulations provided the integrity of the study is protected. It is preferable that the peer-review pathologist(s) perform the peer review under a GLP-compliant quality system after receiving training on GLP regulations and relevant SOPs. If the pathology peer review is not conducted under a GLP-compliant quality system, that fact should be recorded within the study protocol and final study report. The name, affiliation, and work address of the peer-review pathologist(s) should be included in the final study report. Also, the name, qualifications (including GLP training), affiliations, and work address of the peer-review pathologist(s) should be documented in the peer-review pathologist's training files and retained at the testing facility.\n\nQ6: When should the peer-review statement be signed, and should the peer-review pathologist sign the pathology report?\n\nA6: The peer-review statement for a contemporaneous review can be signed by the peer-review pathologist before or after the study pathologist's report is signed. The peer-review statement for a retrospective review is by definition signed by the peer-review pathologist(s) after the study pathologist report is signed. The pathology report is the sole responsibility of the study pathologist, and the peer-review pathologist(s) should not sign the final pathology report. Anychanges to a study pathologist's report resulting from a retrospective pathology peer-review should be documented in an amendment to the study pathologist's report.\n\nQ7: Should the signed peer-review statement be included in the final study report?\n\nA7: Yes, the signed peer-review statement should be included in the final study report.\n\nQ8: How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n\nA8: The pathology report is the responsibility of the study pathologist and reflects that individual's diagnoses and interpretations. The signed and dated pathology report (raw data)4 is critical in facilitating a thorough review of the toxicologic potential of a specific investigational product.\n\nFootnote 4: The final rule, \u201cGood Laboratory Practice Regulations,\u201d published September 4, 1987 (21 CFR Part 58).\n\nTesting facility management should implement appropriate measures to ensure that the conduct of all phases of GLP toxicology studies, including the generation of the pathology report, is free from undue influence impacting the conclusions of the studies. Regarding pathology peer review, the independence of both the study pathologist and the peer-review pathologist(s) throughout the process should be ensured by both the management of the nonclinical testing facility and the sponsor or the applicant. Measures to ensure transparency can include, among other options, the implementation of an audit trail, or conducting contemporaneous peer review after the study pathologist's diagnoses are fixed or locked in an electronic system.\n\nDiverging diagnoses, interpretations, or conclusions between the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s) should be addressed using a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (see Q9).\n\nQ9: How are differences in interpretation that result from pathology peer review addressed?\n--------------------\nContext title: Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.2074986845254898", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: III Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What is whole slide imaging?\n\nA1: Whole slide imaging includes the software and hardware used to generate a two-dimensional digital image4 of a glass histology slide used for routine assessment in generation of the pathology report. The process includes four sequential parts: image acquisition (scanning), image processing, image file storage, and display of images. The FDA does not consider the resulting digital image to be an exact copy of the glass slide. A whole slide image used in a GLP-compliant study should include all the elements from the glass slide that are needed for histopathological examination or pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 4: Digital images comprise a sequence of small images (referred to as tiles) taken from distinct locations on the glass slide. Whole slide imaging systems typically determine the optimal focal plane at a limited, discrete set of locations on the glass slide and interpolate the optimal focal plane to generate all of the tiles. The individual tiles are then combined to create the \u201cwhole slide\u201d image.\n\nQ2: Should whole slide images be retained?\n\nA2: For GLP-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies, if whole slide images are assessed in lieu of the original glass slides and result in the generation of pathology raw data, the whole slide image files should be retained as study records and archived. Consideration should be given to ensure that archived digital images remain viewable as software/hardware updates/versions are implemented.\n\nQ3: If the whole slide image files are retained, should the glass slides also be retained?\n\nA3: Yes. The glass slides contain study specimens and must be retained as study specimens after study finalization in accordance with 21 CFR part 58.\n\nQ4: What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?\n\nA4: The whole slide image files provided to the study pathologist for histopathological examination and/or provided to the peer review pathologist(s) for pathology peer review (i.e., files containing all image data captured by the scanner and documentation of any technical image processing modifications), referred to here as the original whole slide image files, should be retained if they are used to generate raw data. Specifically, any technical image processing modifications made to whole slide image files prior to being provided to the pathologist (e.g., smoothing, color manipulation) should be documented and retained. Technical image processing should not obscure elements captured from the glass slide (e.g., label, artifact).\n\nThe pathologist should not permanently alter the original whole slide image files. Nonpermanent adjustments made by the pathologist using the image viewing software during whole slide image evaluation (e.g., brightness, contrast, annotations) do not need to be documented or retained.\n\nQ5: Should written procedures for whole slide imaging processes be in place?\n\nA5: Yes, written procedures for whole slide imaging processes should be in place because whole slide images may be used to generate raw data. These processes may include, for example, training, slide scanning, software management, and file access and exchange control.\n\nQ6: Should the whole slide imaging system be validated?\n\nA6: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, the whole slide imaging system (including software and hardware) should be validated in a manner specific to the intended use of the technology.\n\nQ7: Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n\nA7: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, they should be protected to prevent loss or alteration of data, maintain chain of custody, control access, and secure data systems and data transmission. These measures should be performed following written procedures and processes in compliance with electronic record requirements under 21 CFR part 11 to maintain whole slide image file integrity.\n\nQ8: Should the signed pathology report/peer review statement state that whole slide images were evaluated in lieu of glass slides?\n\nA8: Yes, the signed pathology report should state whether glass slides or whole slide images were used for histopathological evaluation by the study pathologist, consistent with 21 CFR 58.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nuidance for Industry Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies: Questions and Answers (December 2021). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n--------------------\nContext title: Use of Whole Slide Imaging in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.317486763000488", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: SUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that \"personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform\" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an \"acting\" or \"deputy\" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated \"deputy\" or \"acting\" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n\nThe QAU is not expected to perform a scientific evaluation of a study nor to \"second-guess\" the scientific procedures that are used. QAU inspections are made to ensure that the GLPs, SOPs and protocols are being followed and that the data summarized in the final report accurately reflect the results of the study. A variety of procedures can be used to do this but certainly the procedures should include an examination and correlation of the raw data records.\n\nMust the QAU keep copies of all protocols and amendments and SOPs and amendments?\n\nThe QAU must keep copies of all protocols as currently amended. The only SOPs that the QAU are required to keep are those concerned with the operations and procedures of the QAU.\n\nDoes the QAU have to monitor compliance with regulations promulgated by other government agencies?\n\nThe GLPs do not require this.\n\nCan an individual who is involved in a nonclinical laboratory study perform QAU functions for portions of the study that the individual is not involved with?\n\nNo. However, the individual can perform QAU functions for a study that he/she is not involved with.\n\nDoes the QAU review amendments to the final report? Yes.\n\nWhat studies are required to be listed on the master schedule sheet?\n\nThe master schedule sheet should list all nonclinical laboratory studies conducted on FDA regulated products and intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit.\n\nMay the QAU in its periodic reports to management and the study director recommend actions to solve existing problems? Yes.\n\nIf raw data are transcribed and sent to the sponsor for (a) preparing the data in computer format or (b) performing a statistical analysis, what are the responsibilities of the QAU?\n\nFor (a) the QAU should assure that the computer formatted data accurately reflect the raw data. For (b) the statistical analyses would comprise a report from a participating scientist, therefore it should be checked by QAU and appended to the final report.\n9. Can the QAU also be responsible for maintaining the laboratory archives?\n\nYes.\n10. Can a QAU be constituted as'a single person?\n\nYes, provided that the workload is not excessive and other duties do not prevent the person from doing an adequate job. It would be prudent to designate an alternate in case of disability/vacations/ etc.\n11. Who is responsible for defining study phases and designating critical study phases and can these be covered in the SOP?\n\nThe GLPs do not isolate this responsibility. Logically, the task should be done by the study director and the participating scientists working in concert with the QAU and laboratory management. It can be covered by an SOP.\n\nSUBPART C FACILITIES\n\nSection 58.41 General.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.43 Animal Care Facilities.\n\nDo the GLPs require clean/dirty separation for the animal care areas?\n\nNo. They do require adequate separation of species and studies.\n\nDo the GLPs require that separate animal rooms be used to house test systems and conduct different studies? No. The GLPs require separate areas adequate to assure proper separation of test systems, isolation of individual projects, animal quarantine and routine or specialized housing of animals, as necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n\nDo the GLPs require that access to animal rooms be limited only to authorized individuals? No. However, undue stresses and potentially adverse influences on the test system should be minimized. Section 58.45 Animal Supply Facilities. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.47 Facilities for Handling Test and Control Articles.\n\nDo test and control articles have to be maintained in locked storage units? No, but accurate records of test and control article accountability must be maintained. Section 58.49 Laboratory operation areas. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.51 Specim and data storage facilities. 1. What do the GLPs require with regard to facilities for the archives? Space should be provided for archives limited to access by authorized personnel. Storage conditions should minimize deterioration of documents and specimens. Section 58.53 Administrative and personnel facilities. No questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSUBPART D\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nSection 58.61 Equipment design.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.63 Maintenance and calibration of equipment.\n\nHas FDA established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of equipment (balances) used in nonclinical laboratory studies?\n\nThe agency has not established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of balances used in nonclinical laboratory studies. This would be a large undertaking in part due to the wide variety of equipment that is available and to the differing workloads that would be imposed on the equipment. It is suggested that you work with the equipment manufacturers and your study directors to arrive at a suitable calibration schedule. The key point is that the calibration should be frequent enough to assure data validity. The maintenance and calibration schedules should be part of the SOPs for each instrument.\n\nWhen an equipment manufacturer performs the routine equipment maintenance, do the equipment manufacturer's maintenance procedures have to be described in the facilities' SOPs?\n\nNo. The facilities' SOPs would have to state that maintenance was being performed by the equipment manufacturer according to their own procedures.\n\nSUBPART E\n\nTESTING FACILITIES OPERATION\n\nSection 58.81 Standard Operating Procedures.\n\nWhat amount of detail should be included in the standard operating procedures (SOPs)?\n\nThe GLPs do not specify the amount of detail to be included in the SOPs. The SOPs are intended to minimize the introduction of systematic error into a study by ensuring that all personnel will be familiar with and use the same procedures. The adequacy of the SOPs is a key responsibility of management. A guideline of adequacy that could be used is to determine whether the SOPs are understood and can be followed by trained laboratory personnel.\n\nCan the study director authorize changes in the SOPs? No. Approval of the SOPs and changes thereto is a function of laboratory management.\n\nHow many copies of the complete laboratory SOPs are needed? Each work station should have access to the SOPs applicable to the work performed at the station. A complete set of the SOPs, including authorized amendments, should be maintained in the archives.\n\nWho approves the SOPs of the Quality Assurance Unit? Laboratory Management.\n\nTo what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs? The GLPs do not specify the contents of individual SOPs, but the SOP that deals with computerized data acquisition should include the purpose of the program, the specifications, the procedures, the end products, the language, the interactions with other programs, procedures for assuring authorized data entry and access, procedures for making and authorizing changes to the program, the source listing of the program and perhaps even a flow chart. The laboratory's computer specialists should determine what other characteristics need to be described in the SOP.\n\nSection 58.83 Reagents and solutions.\n1. What are the GLP requirements for labeling of reagents purchased directly from manufacturers? All reagents used in a nonclinical laboratory have to be labeled to indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date. Purchased reagents usually carry all these items except for the expiration date, so the laboratory should label the reagent containers with an expiration date. The expiration date selected should be in line with laboratory experience and need not require specific stability testing.\n2. How extensive should the procedures be for confirming the quality of incoming reagents used in nonclinical laboratory studies? Laboratory management should make this decision but the SOPs should document the actual procedures used.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.8088836669921875", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: If reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes \"studies in progress on June 20, 1979\" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n\nThe Agency does not per se validate protocols. Persons developing new protocols may submit them to the responsible bureau for review and comment prior to initiating a nonclinical laboratory study.\n* One of the testing deficiencies found in the early Agency investigations of nonclinical studies was protocol changes that were made without informing the sponsor. The changes prejudiced the validity of the studies. Accordingly, the GLPs require that each study have a specific protocol, which is attested to by the sponsor.\n* The identity of the individual collecting data entered into a computer can be recorded via the use of a code known only to the individual but directly identifying the individual; similarly the identity of the individuals witnessing or reviewing the data can be recorded. Is this acceptable?\n\nYes, this procedure is acceptable. The key to the code must be made available to Agency investigators. Do note, however, the final GLPs do not require that data entries need be witnessed by a second person.\n* Does the following proposal on data entry to computer files satisfy the GLP intent?\n\nData is entered through keyboard commands and stored in a \"temporary\" computer file with accompanying date, time, and analyst codes. The analyst may be technician level personnel. At the conclusion of a set of observations, no more than one day's worth, the data in the \"temporary file\" is reviewed by a scientist (this person may or may not be the same person who entered the original data) and \"corrected\" for any typing or entry errors. When it is determined that the data are correct, the data are transferred to a \"permanent\" computer file. Only authorized personnel may make changes to the \"permanent\" file.\n\nNo audit trail is kept for changes to \"temporary\" file. All changes to permanent file are recorded in a change file with appropriate data, personnel code, and comments regarding reason for change and original entry.\n\nNo. This method would permit unauthorized tampering with the temporary file before the raw data are transferred to the permanent file.\n* When should a protocol amendment issue? Should it be as soon as possible or could a list of all deviations from a protocol be prepared at the end of the study?If the deviation from the protocol is intended to be permanent, the protocol should be amended as soon as possible. If the deviation is an error, it should be promptly corrected and noted in the raw data.\n* 16. Section 58.120 describes a sixteen-part protocol and section 58.185 describes a fourteen part final report. Must all of these be included in protocols and reports for LD 50's and other short-term tests?\n\nYes.\n* 17. Is a protocol required for routine research and experimentation?\n\nProtocols are required for all studies covered by the GLPs.\n* 18. If all raw data are not required in a final report, does this mean, for example, that weekly body weight or food intake averages can be in a report without the individual animal data?\n\nThe data appearing in a final report depends on the type of study and the kind of regulated product. Specific advice can be obtained by contacting the Agency bureau, which has responsibility for the regulated product.\n* 19. If a compound or formula is proprietary, must the final report describe its detailed composition or chemical structure?\n\nIf the proprietary material is a commercially available article to be used as a control, the final report need only describe the trade or chemical name, the source and the manufacturer's batch number.\n* 20. How does the requirement for \"approval\" of protocols apply to \"in house\" studies which are' conducted in the laboratories of the actual \"sponsor?\" Who approves? What is an \"approved\" protocol?\n\nThe word \"approved\" was retained in the final order to emphasize that a sponsor should have a mechanism for evaluation and approval of initial protocols and all amendments. The specifics of the mechanism can vary but a formal mechanism should be in place.\n* 21. Must the protocol contain both the name and the code number of the test article?\n\nNo, either designation is acceptable.\n* 22. Section 58.120 states that the protocol shall contain the records to be maintained. Is this intended as a detailed list of each data form to be generated?No, in this case generalized statements would be satisfactory.\n23. How much raw data must be entered into notebooks when performing well-documented routine tests? Basically, the GLPs define raw data as the immediate results of original observations. All such immediate results must be entered.\n24. What is meant by the statement in section 58.120(a)(12), which pertains to the method by which the degree of absorption of the test and control articles by the test system will be determined? The GLPs do not mandate that absorption studies need be done, or which kind of study is satisfactory. The GLPs do require, however, that the protocol describe the method used if one is necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n25. Please clarify the issue of having to provide reasons for all corrections to data entries. It seems unreasonable to require reasons for \"obvious\" error corrections such as misspellings, transposed numbers, and wrong year early in a calendar year. It must be remembered that \"raw data\" is basically the results of original observations. Thus, the wrong year is not raw data and can be easily corrected. Misspellings may or may not be raw data whereas in all probability numbers are raw data. The Agency believes that it is sometimes difficult for a second party, such as the personnel in your quality assurance unit, to distinguish \"obvious\" errors. Consequently, the Agency insists that all corrections to raw data entries be justified.\n26. How and to what extent is the selection of the test system to be justified in the protocol? Usually, the test system is selected after consideration of the state-of-the-art of toxicology testing in the area of interest. The protocol need not contain extensive justification.\n27. Are we expected to label all specimens (e.g. serum, blood, urine, tissue slides) with their exact nature?\n\nYes. Such information is useful in preventing mix-ups.\n28. Why does \"test system, study, nature and date of collection\" have to be located on a specimen container? Can such information be coded?Specimen refers to any material derived from a test system for examination or analysis. Consequently, blood, tissues, urine, feces, etc. are considered to be specimens whose containers must carry the required label information. Such information will help preclude mix-ups in the subsequent handling of the specimens. Accession numbers or code numbers can be used for samples of specimens, which are subjected to further analysis. For example, in histopathology the excised fixed tissue is a specimen, which must carry all the label information. However, the blocks and slides prepared from that tissue could be identified by accession numbers. Similarly, in tissue residue analysis, the excised tissue is a specimen; whereas, tissue samples, which are homogenized and otherwise prepared for further analysis, are not specimens and need not carry full labeling.\n\n58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.48729133605957", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTechnical Performance Assessment\n\nof Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food\n\nand Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on: April 20, 2016\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on February 25, 2015\n\nFor questions about this document, contact the Division of Molecular Genetics and Pathology at 301-796-6179 and Nicholas Anderson at 301-796-4310 or\n\nnicholas.anderson@fda.hhs.gov or Aldo Badano at 301-796-2534 or\n\naldo.badano@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nOffice of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health\n\nDivision of Molecular Genetics and Pathology\n\nMolecular Pathology and Cytology Branch\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nYou may submit electronic comments and suggestions at any time for Agency consideration to http://www.regulations.gov.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide industry and agency staff with recommendations regarding the technical performance assessment data that should be provided for regulatory evaluation of a digital whole slide imaging (WSI) system. This document does not cover the clinical submission data that may be necessary to support approval or clearance. This document provides our suggestions on how to best characterize the technical aspects that are relevant to WSI performance for their intended use and determine any possible limitations that might affect their safety and effectiveness.\n\nRecent technological advances in digital microscopy, in particular the development of whole slide scanning systems, have accelerated the adoption of digital imaging in pathology, similar to the digital transformation that radiology departments have experienced over the last decade. FDA regulates WSI system manufacturers to help ensure that the images intended for clinical uses are reasonably safe and effective for such purposes. Essential to the regulation of these systems is the understanding of the technical performance of the WSI system and the components in the imaging chain, from image acquisition to image display and their effect on pathologist's diagnostic performance and workflow. Prior to performing non-technical analytical studies (i.e., those using clinical samples) and clinical studies to evaluate a digital imaging system's performance, the manufacturer should first determine the technical characteristics that are relevant to such performance for its intended use and determine any possible limitations\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]\n\n(\\bullet) Condenser\n\n(\\circ) Illumination format (e.g., Kohler, critical)\n\n(\\circ) Manufacturer and model\n\n(\\circ) Numerical aperture\n\n(\\circ) Focal length\n\n(\\circ) Working distance\n\n(\\bullet) Auxiliary lens(es)\n\n(\\circ) Manufacturer\n\n(\\circ) Lens type\n\n(\\circ) Focal length\n\n(\\bullet) Magnification of imaging optics: ISO 8039:2014 Optics and optical instruments\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\n352IV(A)(6). Image Processing Software\n\n353IV(A)(6)(a). Description\n\n355Image processing software refers to the embedded software components of the image\n\n357acquisition device. It typically includes control algorithms for image capture and\n\n358processing algorithms for raw data conversion into the digital image file.

Image Composition\n\n377IV(A)(7)(a). Description\n\n378(\\bullet) Image composition is a step present in systems that produce whole slide images as\n\n380opposed to individual fields of view. Whole slide scanning is typically performed in\n\n381accordance with the positioning of a stage that moves in submicron steps. At each\n\n382location of the stage movement, an image of the field of view is acquired. Images can be\n\n383acquired with a degree of overlapping (redundancy) between them to avoid gaps in data\n\n384collection. Images can also be acquired at different depths of focus followed by the\n\n385application of focusing algorithms. At the end of this process, all acquired images are\n\n386combined (stitched) together to create a composite high resolution image. There are a\n\n387number of features that can affect this process, and they are listed below. Sponsors\n\n388should provide a description of these features, if applicable:\n\n389(\\bullet) Scanning method\n\n390(\\circ) Single objective or multiple miniature objectives in an array pattern\n\n391(\\circ) Scanning pattern: square matrix acquisition (tiling), line scanning, etc.\n\n392(\\circ) Overlap between scanned regions\n\n393(\\circ) Merging algorithms that stitch the aligned images together into a\n\n394composite image file. Such algorithms may employ functions to align\n\n395adjacent fields of view in accordance to the scanning pattern, overlap, etc.\n\n396(\\circ) Automatic background correction functions to eliminate the effect of non-uniformities in the microscope's illumination and image merging procedure. These non-uniformities if not corrected might create visible borders (seams and stitch lines) between the adjacent fields of view.\n\n400(\\bullet) Scanning speed: time to scan the whole slide. This time is dependent on selected magnification, and the amount of tissue on the glass slide.\n\n402(\\bullet) Number of planes at the Z-axis to be digitized (stack depth)\n\n403(\\bullet) 404(\\bullet) 405(\\bullet) Testing for image composition can be performed on a system level using special calibration slides (such as grid patterns) that can test for line uniformity and focus quality. Sponsors should provide the following outputs for these tests, if applicable:\n\n409(\\bullet) Images of digitized calibration slides\n\n410(\\bullet) Analysis of focus quality metrics\n\n411(\\bullet) Analysis of coverage of the image acquisition for the entire tissue slide\n--------------------\nContext title: Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.9488606452941895"], "Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not address how to link a repackager SNI to a manufacturer SNI, nor does it address standards for prescription drug SNI at levels other than the package-level including, for example, the case- and pallet-levels. Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, \"Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA\u2019s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.14424021542072296", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6915342807769775", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.5.1 FDA Regionally Controlled Terminology for Section G.k: Drug(s) Information\n\nFDA currently uses regional controlled terminologies to support ISO IDMP Standards.

Reporters can use either only the first two segments of the NDC or the full NDC as regional MPID in ICSR reporting to FDA.\n\n4.2.5.3 Data Element G.k.2.2: Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source\n\nFDA validates Medicinal Product Names for products marketed in the United States against the available Structured Product Labeling (SPL)24 XML file or the label that was submitted with the ICSR as an attachment. When the product has an SPL file, use the same naming convention in the ICSR as the name appears in the SPL file. When submitting a product label as an attachment to an ICSR, use the name as it appears on the submitted product label.\n\nIf the Medicinal Product Name is not provided but the active substance name is known, provide the active substance as it appears in the FDA SRS Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNII) (see https://precision.fda.gov/unisearch) list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.\n\nIf data element G.k.2.2, Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source, is a foreign product trade name, provide the active substance name as it appears in the FDA SRS UNII list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.

Future dates are not acceptable in an ICSR message.\n\nUse of Metric Units\n\nMetric units should be used for measurement values.\n\nVersion of Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)\n\nA single version of MedDRA should be used for all MedDRA coding data elements within the same ICSR (i.e., ICSR message). Therefore, the same MedDRA version should be reflected in all the populated data elements concerning MedDRA version information. However, within a safety message (i.e., a batch of ICSRs), different ICSRs can refer to different MedDRA versions.\n\nStandard Terminologies and Codelists\n\nIf a data element is defined with a specific codelist (in the \"Values\" column of the Business Rules), the associated codelist needs to always be used. Also, when the codelist code is captured as the value of a data element, its text name should be provided in display name to make the XML code human readable.\n\nUse of nullFlavors\n\nNullFlavors are used to explain the reason for the lack of data on required elements. The definitions of nullFlavors are from the E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG and can be used as appropriate.\n\nICSR Attachment(s)\n\nIn accordance with E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG, ICSR attachments should be sent inline as embedded files using base 64 encoding (refer to E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG Section 3.5 (Document Attachments) for further information). To facilitate ICSR attachment file processing, the data element \"Attachment file name\" must be included using the (<)reference value(>) data element in the XML file, which must be placed after the (<)text mediaType(>) tag.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n(<)reference typeCode=\"REFR\"(>)\n\n(<)document classCode=\"DOC\" moodCode=\"EVN\"(>)\n\n(<)code code=\"1\" codeSystem=\"2.16.840.1.113883.3.989.2.1.1.27\"\n\ndisplayName=\"documentsHeldBySender\"/(>)\n\n(<)title(>)Narrative Summary Report\n\n(<)text mediaType=\"text/plain\" representation=\"B64\"(>)\n\n(<)reference value=\"Narrative Summary Report.pdf\"/(>)\n\nVGhllIHBhdGllbnQgd2FzIGEgMzUgeWxlIHdpdGggbbm8gc=\n\n(<)/text(>)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(<)/document(>)\n\n(<)/reference(>)\n\nSpecial Note: the \"attachment file name\" must follow the naming convention for a valid \"url\". Letters, digits, and special characters \"a\"-\"z\", digits, as well as the characters plus (\"+\"), period (\".\"), and hyphen (\"-\") are allowed.\n\nIf the file type in the reference value tag does not match the file extension in the file name, the file will be rejected. For example, a file with (<)reference value=\"SAMPLE FILE.txt\"/(>) must have a text file media type reported.\n\nFor more information about restrictions, see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt.\n\nICSR Attachment File-Size Limitations\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Regional Implementation Guide for E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports for Drug and Biological Products\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8303316831588745", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.3 Ndc\n\nTo identify each drug for which you are reporting, you will use the 10-digit NDC for the drug as listed with FDA.

The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product's standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a \"2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for packages and in a \"linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using \"human-readable or machine-readable methods.\"11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled \"Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,\" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency's thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A \"product\" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a \"prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.\"\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of \u201ctransaction\u201d (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a \"product\" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining \u201cproduct.\u201d\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of \u201cproduct\u201d under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered \u201cradioactive drugs\u201d or \u201cradioactive biological products\u201d, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: \u00a7 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

Product Identifier is defined in section 581(14) and includes the product\u2019s standardized numerical identifier, which is composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number (see section 581(20)).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nProduct Tracing and Verification\n\nUnder section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act, trading partners are required to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information22 for each transaction23 involving a DSCSA-covered MMA product. For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA\u2019s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA's view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, \u201cSubmission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,\u201d on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA's initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated \"May Proceed\" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA's timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1.

The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a \"statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content.\" What does FDA consider to be a \"sweetener?\" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term \"sweetener\" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.0430827140808105", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n\na) Single strength apple juice has a Brix value of 11.5 (21 CFR 101.30). You may use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice or other information such as data obtained through chemical analysis, information from databases, or reference documents (see response to Q&A 9). Therefore, the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice is 11.5% (based on weight).\n\nb) Determine the density of single strength apple juice with a Brix value of 11.5. You can either measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nc) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of single strength apple juice of the same type = 240 ml x density (g/ml) x 11.5 % (or.115).\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n\n11. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit juice blend containing the juices of multiple fruit types that is reconstituted above 100 percent where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)?\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is equal to or less than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice (e.g., less than 100% juice), the added sugar declaration would be zero.\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is greater than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final juice blend.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished juice blend product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the juice blend were reconstituted to single strength juice of the same type (i.e., the weight of sugars in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type). The single strength juice of the same type is a juice that contains the same ratios of the apple, mango, and pear juices in our hypothetical example.\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you can make a single strength juice blend with the same ratios of the three juices and measure the amount of total sugars per 240 ml serving size.\n\nYou can also calculate the sugar weight in the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type by the following method:\n\na) Calculate the ratios of the three juices in your formulation based on weight.\n\nTo obtain the weight-based ratios of the three juices in this hypothetical juice blend example, you need to first determine the weight-based concentration factors for the three types of juice. The weight-based concentration factor is the ratio of the Brix values between the concentrate and the single strength juice. For example, the weight-based concentration factor for the apple juice in the hypothetical example is 70 / 11.5 = 6.087. Using a similar calculation, the weight based concentration factor for the mango juice is 5.385 and the weight based concentration factor for the pear juice is 5.833.\n\nBecause the hypothetical juice blend formulation has 10% apple juice concentrate (70 Brix), 10% mango juice concentrate (70 Brix), and 20% pear juice concentrate (70 Brix), the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type would have the following ratios of single strength apple juice, single mango juice, and single pear juice:\n\nPercentage apple juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) apple juice concentration factor; percentage mango juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) mango juice concentration factor; percentage pear juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) pear juice concentration factor\n\nOr\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%. The sum of the ratios is 100% because all of the sugars in the juice blend are from the three types of juices.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSingle apple juice: single strength mango juice: single strength pear juice =\n\n({)[0.6087 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[0.5385 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[1.167 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (})\n\nOr\n\n26.30%: 23.27%: 50.42%\n\nb) Calculate the theoretical Brix value of the single strength juice blend of the same type juice with the same ratios of the three juices.\n\nThe theoretical Brix value of the juice blend is the sum of the multiplication products of the Brix value and the percentage contribution (the ratio percentage from step 2a) for each type of juice.\n\n(Single strength apple juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength apple juice) + (single strength mango juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength mango juice) + (single strength pear juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single pear juice) = theoretical Brix value of the hypothetical juice blend.\n\n11.5% (\\times) 26.31% + 13% (\\times) 23.27% + 12% (\\times) 50.42% = 12.10%.\n\nc) Determine the density of single strength juice blend with a Brix value of 12.10. You can either experimentally measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nd) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type with the same ratios of the three types of juice = 240 ml (\\times) density (g/ml) (\\times) 12.10 %.\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.5804526805877686", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4400886297225952", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2674410045146942", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Or\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%.

The amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition. Juice (fruit or vegetable) ingredients are unique in that the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient depends on whether the juice ingredient is concentrated, and thus, contains sugar in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. We realize that food formulation is complex and manufacturers can use different ingredients or alternative formulas to achieve the same finished product composition. For example, you may use 100% fruit juice and dry sugar in a baking application. You also may have an alternative formulation that uses concentrated fruit juice and liquid syrup to achieve the same product composition. When water or other wet ingredients containing water (e.g. milk, syrup, egg, diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, etc.) are added to a formulation containing concentrated juice and other ingredients during processing, the amount of moisture that goes towards reconstituting the juice or towards wetting or reconstituting other ingredients is not known. Furthermore, if the water added during formulation is divided among the ingredients when determining the amount of reconstitution or wetting that has occurred, different formulations of the same finished food could have different calculated added sugar amounts. Therefore, we considered an approach that we believe would provide a reasonable estimate of the added sugars content of a multi-ingredient product that includes concentrated fruit juice as an ingredient (e.g. a bakery product, marinade, or diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume). When concentrated juices are used in the formulation, we believe that it is practical to use all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of the concentrated juice when calculating the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product. It is also possible that the initial juice ingredient in the formulation (either diluted, 100%, or concentrated) is further concentrated during processing due to loss of water (e.g., during drying or baking). Because the amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition, you should account for the loss of water during processing to reflect the concentration of the juice ingredient after processing. Considering the complexity of food formulation and processing, we believe it is also appropriate to use the moisture content of the finished product towards reconstitution of the juice soluble solids when the product is subject to water loss during processing. This approach is consistent with our approach for the use of all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of concentrated juices when calculating the added sugars content of an ingredient. The following general approach can be used to calculate the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation. This general approach applies when there is either dilution or concentration during manufacturing.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of total sugars contributed by the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 2: Determine the water content (i.e., the moisture content) of the finished product.\n\nStep 3: Determine the sugar concentration of the juice ingredient with the assumption that all of the water in the finished product can be used to reconstitute the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 4: Compare this sugar concentration of juice ingredient with that of the theoretical single strength juice of the same type.\n\n(a) If the sugar concentration is less than, or the same as, the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient is zero.\n\n(b) If the sugar concentration is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, you may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 5: The amount of total added sugar per serving is the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient determined from step 4(b) plus added sugars from other ingredients (e.g., cane sugar), if any, in the formulation.\n\nIf you use multiple juice ingredients in your formulation, you may follow the same general steps above except that in step 4(b) you would need to use the method described in Q&A 12 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the multiple juice ingredients.\n\nTo demonstrate the general approach described above, we provide two hypothetical examples below. In these hypothetical examples, we use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration.\n\nHypothetical example 1:\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (5% apple juice at 70 Brix value). The finished product has a serving size of 250 gm and a moisture content of 50%.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars in the juice ingredient = weight per serving (\\times) percentage apple juice concentrate (\\times) % sugar in apple juice concentrate = 250 g (\\times) 5% (\\times) 70% = 8.75 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content or the moisture content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times) moisture content = 250 g (\\times) 50% = 125 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7177389860153198", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Process I: The first process is simple to use, as outlined on the following table:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \\hline\nNutrient & Selection Criteria \\ \\hline Class I and Class II & Select the lower of the mean or the predicted value \\ \\hline Third Group & Select the higher of the mean or the predicted value \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nProtein is a class II nutrient. Because the mean (4.6003) is greater than the predicted value (4.309638), you would select the predicted value for the nutrition label for broccoli. [The rounded predicted value would be 4 g; a discussion of rounding will follow in section 7.] However, with analyzing individual units, the mean is smaller than the predicted value (5.1852714); in that case, you would select the mean for the nutrition label [actually, both would round to 5 g].\n\n23.8.25.2.5.27.31\n\nProcess II: The second process that may be used to determine a nutrition label value considers the coefficient of variation (ev). The formula for the ev, expressed as a percent, is:\n\nev = 1oo (s) / mean, where\n\ns = the standard deviation\n\nIn the broccoli example above, the ev is (100 x.6165770) / 4.6003 =13-402974-\n\nWhen the ev is small, the mean is more likely to be a candidate for selection as the label value. The upper limits of the ev have been calculated to show that, if the sample ev is smaller than the upper limit: 1) the predicted value for class II nutrients always exceeds the corresponding sample mean, and 2) the predicted value for the third group of nutrients is always less than the corresponding sample mean. The upper limits are related to the sample size and whether the nutrient analyses included individual units (1z individual units) or composite analyses (of 1z units each). The table below lists the upper limits of the ev associated with use of the sample mean for label values. If the ev for your nutrient of choice is less than the upper limit on the table below, then the mean should be used on the label.\n\nFor the broccoli example, the ev rounds to 13. Because the data were analyzed as 1z composites of 1z, the first step is to find 1z, the sample size, under the first column of the table. Next you look at the third column (Upper Limit for 1z-Unit Composites). If you follow the third column to the row indicating 1z samples, you find that the upper limit is 10.7. Because the ev (ev = 13) is greater than 10.7, you will select the predicted value for the nutrition label [4 g, as indicated above].\n\nOn the other hand, if the data were analyzed as 1z individual units, you follow the second column (Upper Limit for Individual Units) to the row indicating 1z samples, and find that the upper limit is 27.279. Because the ev (ev = 13) is less than 27.279, you will select the mean value for the nutrition label [5 g, as indicated above].\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-guide-developing-and-using-data-bases-nutrition-labeling23.8 2.5 2.5 7.31\n\nGuidance for Industry: Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling | FDA\n\nFootnote 2: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-guide-developing-and-using-data-bases-nutrition-labeling\n\n6 Calculate the percent daily value (DV) for the appropriate nutrients\n\nThere are two sets of reference values for reporting nutrients in nutrition labeling: 1)Daily Reference Values (DRVs) and 2) Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs). These values assist customers in interpreting information about the amount of a nutrient that is present in a food and in comparing nutritional values of food products. DRVs are established for adults and children four or more years of age, as are RDIs, with the exception of protein. DRVs are provided for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, potassium, and protein. RDIs are provided for vitamins and minerals and for protein for children less than four years of age and for pregnant and lactating women. In order to limit consumer confusion, however, the label includes a single term, i.e., Daily Value (DV), to designate both the DRVs and RDIs. Specifically, the label includes the % DV, except that the % DV for protein is not required unless a protein claim is made for the product or if the product is to be used by infants or children under four years of age. The following table lists the DVs based on a caloric intake of 2,000 calories, for adults and children four or more years of age.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nFood Component & DV \\ \\hline Total Fat & 65 grams (s) \\ \\hline Saturated Fat & 20 g \\ \\hline Cholesterol & 300 milligrams (mg) \\ \\hline Sodium & 2,400 mg \\ \\hline Potassium & 3,500 mg \\ \\hline Total Carbohydrate & 300 g \\ \\hline Dietary Fiber & 25 g \\ \\hline Protein & 50 g \\ \\hline Vitamin A & 5,000 International Units (II) \\ \\hline Vitamin C & 60 mg \\ \\hline Calcium & 1,000 mg \\ \\hline Ion & 18 mg \\ \\hline Vitamin D & 400 IU \\ \\hline Vitamin E & 30 IU \\ \\hline Vitamin K & 80 microorganisms p/g \\ \\hline Titanium & 1.5 mg \\ \\hline Rhodarin & 1.7 mg \\ \\hline Naich & 20 mg \\ \\hline Vitamin B({}{4}) & 2 mg \\ \\hline Felate & 400 mg \\ \\hline Vitamin B({}{12}) & 6 mg \\ \\hline Bott & 300 mg \\ \\hline Pant Pantheine acid & 10 mg \\ \\hline Phosphorus & 1,000 mg \\ \\hline lodine & 150 mg \\ \\hline Magnesium & 400 mg \\ \\hline Zinc & 15 mg \\ \\hline Selenium & 70 mg \\ \\hline Copper & 2 mg \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]\n\nThe previous example, although referring to production line sampling, reflects a stratified sampling procedure with production lines defining the strata. This procedure may be used when samples are either proportionally or disproportionally collected from strata that either naturally exist or can be meaningfully defined.\n\nChapter III: Ingredient Data Bases\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter I, an ingredient or \"recipe\" data base uses software to calculate label values derived from the ingredients that comprise a product's recipe, taking into account nutrient losses during processing.\n\nAny association or manufacturer with an ingredient data base should also have a comprehensive quality management program which includes audits of ingredient nutrient data, product recipes, the software program, and final product analysis. Another crucial element is an ongoing program that compares nutrient data derived through laboratory analyses to ingredient data base calculations for finished products. Such comparisons are critical to cross validating the data that are used in a data base and to maintaining its integrity.\n\nThe agency does not currently have a policy on recommended procedures for comparing laboratory data to nutrient values calculated in an ingredient data base. One option would be to determine the percent of the nutrients where the laboratory and label values are equivalent when both are rounded. Another method would be based upon FDA compliance requirements, as specified in 21 CFR 10.9(g)(4). As indicated in Chapter I, in order to determine whether a nutrient value that is printed on a product package is in compliance, the agency completes laboratory analyses of the product and compares the nutrient values obtained through those analyses with the nutrient values provided on the package label. Specifically, that procedure, and one that a data base developer may wish to consider, is to examine the ratio between the laboratory value (unrounded) and the label value (rounded as included on the product package). Please note that error related to rounding is always a possibility.\n\nFDA has adopted several principles relative to the development of ingredient composition data bases, which were recommended by companies and trade associations:\n\nConfidence in the quality of data, supported by documentation of data sources. Companies maintaining or using ingredient composition data bases should be able to demonstrate the data source used for each type of product and each nutrient for which ingredient composition data bases are utilized.\n\nProper maintenance of the data base. Companies developing or using ingredient composition data bases should have procedures in place to ensure that the values in the ingredient composition data bases are reviewed and updated as needed and on a regular basis.\n\nSpecificity with respect to ingredients, product formulations and processes. Companies using ingredient composition data bases should have procedures in place to ensure that the nutrient values are used only for specific applications. For example, a company should have a procedure to ensure that nutrient data specific for one product formulation or process are not used to prepare nutrient declarations for similar product formulations or processes, without assurance that the data are applicable to those products or processes.\n\nValidation of the data base. Companies developing or using ingredient composition data bases should have procedures in place to ensure that nutrient values receive reviews, audits, and confirmation through nutrient analyses as often as necessary.\n\nChapter IV: The FDA Data Base Review Process\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.29662561416626"], "Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n\nExamples of biological products approved under the FD&C Act are listed in the Appendix to the Transition Policy Final Guidance. To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA's electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from \"NDA\" to \"BLA\") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA's Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA's preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA's website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA's draft guidance for industry Implementation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended definition of \"biological product\" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.829297065734863", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: B.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n\nThe FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA).\n\nFootnote 12: See also footnote 10 in the response to Q2.\n\nFDA issues only one U.S. license number per BLA holder, regardless of the number of licensed biological products manufactured by that BLA holder under separate BLAs. Accordingly, if an NDA holder is also a BLA holder and has been assigned a U.S. license number for another biological product, the NDA holder will not be issued a different U.S. license number when its approved NDA for a biological product is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 351(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHS Act requires that each package of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, the applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. To minimize possible disruption in the distribution of biological products in the United States and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA intends to adopt a compliance policy for the labeling of biological products that are the subject of deemed BLAs (see Q14 and section IV below for additional information on the compliance policy for labeling of biological products in deemed BLAs).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision, along with the applicable provisions of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, to mean that an approved NDA, including an application submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (505(b)(2) application), will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020, and does not explicitly state whether an approved NDA will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA. The Agency's interpretation that an approved NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA is based on the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency). We expect that the measures FDA has taken to minimize differences in the review and approval of products in marketing applications submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will facilitate implementation of the statutory provision under which an approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA.\n\nThe Agency's interpretation that an approved 505(b)(2) application will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA reflects the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency).13 This approach also reflects the Agency's view that it is more appropriate to regulate a biological product approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway that may be intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different strength, dosage form, or route of administration or approved conditions of use) from a previously approved product under the statutory and regulatory framework for 351(a) BLAs, as such differences are not permitted under the statutory framework for 351(k) BLAs. Moreover, FDA's approval of a 505(b)(2) application reflects the Agency's evaluation of the data against a different statutory standard than a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing be deemed to be a BLA?*\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) states that an \"approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]\" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed.\n\nHow will the transition on March 23, 2020, affect the annual program fee for an approved NDA for a biological product?\n\nUnder section 736(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person named as the applicant in a human drug application (which refers to an NDA or a 351(a) BLA, subject to applicable statutory exceptions) is assessed an annual prescription drug program fee. A prescription drug program fee is assessed each fiscal year for each prescription drug product identified in a human drug application approved as of October 1 of the fiscal year, with certain exceptions described by statute. For more information about the prescription drug program fee, consult the FDA guidance for industry Assessing User Fees Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (May 2018).\n\nIn general, sponsors of biological products for which annual prescription drug program fees are assessed prior to the transition, and that are deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date, will continue to be assessed prescription drug program fees for such products after the transition, subject to applicable statutory requirements and exceptions.\n\nIf an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved on or before the transition date, or otherwise pending with FDA, and submits an application for the same product under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, will an additional PDUFA application fee be assessed?\n\nAn applicant (or the applicant's licensee, assignee, or successor) will not be charged a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee for the submission of an application under section 351(a) of the PHS Act if all of the following circumstances are satisfied (see section 736(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe applicant previously submitted an NDA for the same product and paid the associated PDUFA application fee for the NDA.\n\nThe NDA was accepted for filing. (Note that an NDA for a biological product will not be accepted for filing after the transition date.)\n\nThe NDA was not approved14 or was withdrawn (without a waiver). Footnote 14: An NDA that is tentatively approved is notan approved NDA (see 21 CFR 314.105(a)).\n\nFor questions regarding user fees, please contact the User Fee Staff at\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.7049672603607178", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Q16. What is required for CMC changes submitt d in a PAS or changes being effected supplements submitted to deemed 351(a) BLAs?\n\nFDA requires applicants or application holders of biological products--whether approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act--to notify FDA about each change in the conditions established in an approved application. The types of reporting categories for biological products generally are the same for an NDA (see 21 CFR 314.70) and for a BLA (see 21 CFR 601.12), and in both cases, the applicant or application holder is expected to demonstrate that the postchange product continues to be of acceptable quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. Overall, the nature and type of data required to support such a demonstration has historically been similar for biological products approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act.\n\nHowever, there are limited differences with respect to the type, timing, and evaluation of certain data in submissions, and verification of these data during the review cycle and inspection varies. For example, validation data would be required to be submitted in BLA supplements to support certain postapproval changes (21 CFR 601.12). In another example, for biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (\"non-specified biological products\"), compliance with the establishment standards set forth under 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12, and 600.13 may be required for a BLA supplement to support certain postapproval changes (e.g., addition of a new facility).\n\nApplication holders that intend to propose manufacturing changes are encouraged to contact OPQ/OPRO at CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. FDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden.\n\nv.1.1 Data Necessary to Support a Process or Manufacturing Site Change\n\nSupplements to applications for biological products subject to the transition provision that remain under review after the transition date, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date, must comply with 21 CFR 601.12 and other applicable regulations. Applicants should also consult relevant guidances for biological products. A supplement submitted to a deemed BLA to support process or manufacturing site changes must contain, for the lots manufactured using the postchange process, manufacturing process validation data (see 21 CFR 601.12). Specifically, process validation for a BLA should be performed at commercial manufacturing scale, prior to submission of a supplement. Process validation information should be included in the supplement as this may affect submission and implementation timelines of the changes for commercial distribution.\n\nA supplement requesting approval of a proposed change to the manufacturing site for a biological product also must assess the effects of the change and contain sufficient information to support the safety, purity, and potency of material manufactured with the change (21 CFR 601.12(a)(2); compare 21 CFR 314.70). In assessing the effects of the change, information demonstrating comparability of the pre and postchange material should also be submitted, consistent with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (June 2005) and the recommendations below.\n\nComparability data.\n\nThe type and amount of data needed to support a comparability exercise depends on the extent of the changes and the potential risk to product quality. A robust control strategy for drug substance and drug product is critical in generating comparability data. For example, a potency assay that is accurate, precise, and reliable will facilitate the review of manufacturing changes. In some cases, in addition to the typical battery of release tests, extended characterization may be necessary for comparison, in particular for process changes that may affect purity, potency, or safety of the product.\n\nBatch analysis data.\n\nAppropriate stability data.\n\nGenerally, limited real-time stability data for the postchange product and comparability study results, including stability data under accelerated and stressed storage conditions, are sufficient to leverage existing stability data to support the shelf life of the postchange product.\n\nAs with all biological products, FDA may recommend changes to the control strategy throughout the product life cycle to modernize outdated assays, to address product-specific issues, and to help ensure that biological products remain safe, pure, and potent for their approved conditions of use.\n\nvi.2.2 Facility Inspections Related to Certain Supplements to a Deemed 351(a) BLA\n\nWhether a biological product is regulated under the FD&C Act or the PHS Act, application holders for biological products should be ready for FDA inspections to assure such compliance with the conditions of approval.\n\nAfter March 23, 2020, supplements submitted to deemed BLAs, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date but with an action date after the transition date, must comply with the inspection requirements as specified in the relevant regulations in 21 CFR part 600.\n\nIn particular, supplements for site changes where facilities are added to the license or supplements for major manufacturing changes may be subject to an inspection. FDA intends to contact the holder of a deemed BLA to schedule any such inspection during the review of the supplement. After March 23, 2020, holders of deemed BLAs that submit a site change or major manufacturing change supplement are advised that, as with the holder of any BLA, they should be ready for an inspection while in operation and manufacturing the product for which the change is requested during the supplement review timeframe.\n\nQ17. Can the application holder for a deemed 351(a) BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway submit a supplement that relies, in part, on FDA's finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product?\n\nSupplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA, like any supplement to any 351(a) BLA, must meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act. The holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway may not, for example, submit an efficacy supplement to the deemed 351(a) BLA that relies on FDA's finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product (e.g., for a newly approved indication or other condition of use for a related biological product).\n\nThere might be instances where there is a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA or a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application that would be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date. To obtain approval under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, the applicant may need to amend the administratively converted supplement to provide the scientific data necessary to meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act, or a right of reference to such data, for the change proposed in the supplement.\n\nQ18. Can a biological product approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date subsequently be a \"reference product\" for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product?\n\nA biological product approved in an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) application) that is deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act may be a reference product for a 351(k) BLA. The term \"reference product\" is defined as the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8703821897506714", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA's draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.598012089729309", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Accordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline Date/Time & Relevant Application Type & Event \\ \\hline Friday, March 20, 2020, 11:59 pm (EDT) & Pending 505(b)(2) applications that rely, at least in part, on FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product & Deadline for any pending 505(b)(2) application of this type to be approved under the FD\\&C Act. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 12:00 am (EDT) & Approved NDAs for biological products & Approved NDAs for biological products are deemed to be BLAs, and cease to exist as NDAs. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 12:01 am (EDT) & 351(k) BLA that relies on a deemed BLA for its reference product & A 351(k) BLA can be submitted for a proposed biosimilar or a proposed interchangeable to a biological reference product that is the subject of a deemed BLA. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 11:59 pm (EDT) & Approved NDAs for biological products & FDA intends to send a letter to each holder of an approved NDA for a biological product that advises that the approved NDA has been deemed to be a BLA by operation of the statute, and no longer exists as an NDA.

For example, a pending \"stand-alone\" efficacy supplement to a \"stand-alone\" NDA16 (e.g., a supplement intended to address a post-approval requirement or post-approval commitment) will be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date and reviewed under applicable standards for 351(a) BLAs. Similarly, a pending CBE supplement to an application submitted under the FD&C Act will be administratively converted to a pending CBE supplement to the deemed BLA on the transition date, irrespective of whether the change described in the CBE supplement has been implemented before or after the transition date. The Agency also intends to maintain the same goal date, where applicable, for completion of its review of such supplements.\n\nFootnote 15: See generally 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nFootnote 16: See section III.B.1 of this guidance for information on \u201cstand-alone\u201d NDAs. There may be additional considerations for a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA and a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application.\n\nii.2.2 Removal of Biological Products from the Orange Book on March 23, 2020\n\nFDA intends to remove biological products that have been approved in NDAs from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book)17 on March 23, 2020, based on the Agency's position that these products are no longer \"listed drugs\" and such NDAs may not be relied upon by a 505(b)(2) applicant (or ANDA applicant) for approval. After March 23, 2020, FDA will not approve any NDA (or ANDA), including those that are pending or tentatively approved, for a biological product.\n\nFootnote 17: Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be listed in FDA\u2019s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity, the exclusivity provisions of the FD&C Act serve to limit the submission or approval of applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act, but not under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that no applications for biological products may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act after the transition date. Accordingly, on March 23, 2020, any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act (e.g., 5-year exclusivity or 3-year exclusivity) would\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\ndeemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. Reference product exclusivity recognizes the fact that the sponsor of an eligible reference product generated (and submitted for review) the data and information required to obtain a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and limits competition from biosimilar and interchangeable products for a limited period of time. The biological products that will be deemed to have BLAs on the transition date, however, have already obtained marketing approval under a different statutory authority. Allowing such products to obtain a separate 12-year period of reference product exclusivity would inappropriately impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition in several product classes.\n\nRecognizing these principles, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act together with section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act such that section 351(k)(7)(A)-(B) of the PHS Act applies only to products that have undergone review and licensing under section 351(a), and not to biological products that will be deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date. At the same time, FDA interprets the limitations on eligibility for reference product exclusivity in section 351(k)(7)(C) of the PHS Act to apply to any \"reference product,\" without regard to whether such product was \"first licensed under subsection (a)\" or instead deemed to be a license under section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act. Nothing in the BPCI Act suggests that Congress intended holders of deemed BLAs to be able to circumvent the statutory limitations on eligibility for a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity through subsequent submissions simply because the previous reference product was deemed to be licensed under section 7002(e). Therefore, FDA interprets section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act together with section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act such that section 351(k)(7)(C) will operate to bar supplements to deemed BLAs and, where applicable, subsequent BLAs from being eligible for their own periods of reference product exclusivity.\n\nRecommendations for Sponsors of Proposed Protein Products Intended for Submission in an Application Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act\n\nSponsors of development programs for proposed protein products should evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. FDA's recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a \"stand-alone\" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 \"Stand-Alone\" New Drug Applications\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6605825424194336", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Applicant: Any person or legal entity that has submitted an application to manufacture a product subject to licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262).

Note: Although the firm does not need to include the specific legal contract in the submission, the submission should include a description of the services performed by the contractor for each manufacturing step, for example, the performance by an outside testing laboratory of routine donor/product testing or confirmatory testing, the irradiation of products, the supply of red blood cells for immunization, or the provision of storage services. The agreement should also be available for review during inspections.\n\nCore Personnel: Establishment/facility management, medical personnel and staff responsible for quality oversight.\n\nComparability Protocol (CP): A PAS describing the specific tests and validation studies and acceptable limits to be achieved to demonstrate the lack of adverse effects for specified types of manufacturing changes on the safety or effectiveness of the product, which must be approved by FDA before distribution of the product (21 CFR 601.12(e)).\n\nDisease-Associated IgG Antibody Donor: A donor who meets all the required or recommended normal Source Plasma donor eligibility criteria and whose plasma contains pre-existing IgG antibodies as a result of previous exposure to certain diseases or cellular antigens (Ref. [10]).\n\nDisease-State/High-Risk Donor: A donor whose plasma contains or lacks a specific property (for example, a protein, antibody, inherited trait) as a result of the donor's disease. Note: This donor may not meet all the required or recommended Source Plasma donor eligibility criteria but nonetheless may be an acceptable donor under certain circumstances.\n\neSubmitter: An electronic submissions program that is currently available for voluntary use by sponsors, manufacturers, and importers to submit a variety of submission types for FDA-regulated products. eSubmitter is an acceptable mechanism for the submission of BLAs, BLA supplements, annual reports and amendments to pending eSubmitter regulatory submissions by licensed blood establishments that collect Whole Blood and blood components, including Source Plasma (Ref. [11]).\n\nEstablishment/Facility: A place of business under one management at one general physical location. The term includes, among others, human blood and plasma donor centers, blood banks, transfusion services, other blood product manufacturers and independent laboratories that engage in quality control and testing for registered blood product establishments. Note: The facility in which a biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held must meet standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(2)(C)(i)(II)). The term \"establishment\" has the same meaning as \"facility\" and includes all locations (21 CFR 600.3(w)) (Ref. [12]).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTypes of Facilities:\n\nCollection Facility: A facility that collects Whole Blood and/or apheresis products, and/or performs plasmapheresis collected by manual or automated methods, but does not perform FDA required or recommended blood and plasma donor testing. Collection facilities may also label, store, and distribute blood products.\n\nCommunity Blood Bank: A commercial or non-profit blood collection/processing facility, not located in a hospital, that may perform manual and/or automated blood collection, prepare components from Whole Blood, perform FDA required or recommended blood and plasma donor testing, perform compatibility testing and that routinely labels, stores, and distributes blood and/or blood products to one or more hospitals. Community blood banks may also prepare irradiated, frozen, deglycerolized and/or leukored products, pre-storage pooled Platelets and pre-storage pooled Cryoprecipitated AHF.\n\nComponent Preparation Facility: An intermediate processing facility that prepares components from Whole Blood or further processes apheresis components collected at a mobile or fixed collection site but does not perform FDA required or recommended blood and plasma donor testing.

On occasion, the Agency may request such documents when pursuing an audit trail of a possible violation. Under these circumstances, it is the laboratory's prerogative to cooperate or refuse without fear of reprisal. The requests should be specific and pertinent to the inspection. The Agency discourages investigators from making vague requests to see documents with no specific purpose in mind.\n* Should the Form-FD-483, Notice of Observations issued by the FDA investigator reflect current practices only; and should it include practices that were corrected during the course of the inspection?\n\nThe FD-483 can include historical practices, which may have affected the scientific validity of the nonclinical study in question even though subsequent correction may have occurred. Any corrective action taken by the facility will be noted by the investigator in the establishment inspection report.\n* At time of the observation, the management should discuss any differing opinions and attempt to clarify the investigator's perceptions or observations. The management may also, at the conclusion of the inspection, offer to explain what the management considers to be erroneous 483 observations. Should the matter in question remain unresolved, a written objection should be sent to the local FDA district director or a meeting with district personnel should be requested to attempt to resolve the issue.\n* What is the procedure for correcting errors in the FDA investigator's inspection report? Such errors can be damaging to the laboratories since the reports are ultimately available through FOI.\n\nIf in fact an error is made in an investigator's report, the matter should be immediately brought to the attention of FDA district management. If district management agrees with the complaint, the report will be amended and amended reports will be sent to all outside persons who may have received the erroneous report. It should be stressed, however, that the time to change what a facility believes is an erroneous conclusion is when the FD-483 is discussed with laboratory management because as soon as the FD-483 is presented to management, it becomes available for public disclosure.\n18. Does refusal to allow the FDA investigator access to certain information, which the laboratory sincerely believes is not subject to FDA jurisdiction, constitute a refusal of inspection? How can a disagreement of this kind be resolved? Refusal to permit access to records which are associated with a study being audited or which preclude a judgement being made regarding compliance with GLPs, is considered a refusal of inspection with certain ensuing consequences. However, a facility may legitimately question FDA authority to review certain documents. Such objections and the reasons therefore, should be presented in writing or by telephone to the FDA district office management where the investigator is based. Each case will be individually reviewed both in the field and, if necessary at headquarters and a decision will be communicated to the inspected facility.\n19. Will inspections and audits of foreign laboratories be carried out? Who pays for these inspections? Inspections are being conducted of foreign facilities, which have engaged in nonclinical studies, which have been submitted to FDA in support of a marketing permit. FDA pays for travel and other expenses associated with such inspections.\n20. In order for foreign laboratories to comply with the GLPs, do protocols, standard operating procedures, records, etc. have to be in English? Do FDA investigators bring interpreters with them to review records and data? Submissions to FDA in support of a marketing application for a FDA regulated product must be in English. Review of source documents at the site of the foreign facility may necessitate review of documents written in the language of the country of origin. FDA does not employ interpreters to accompany investigators on foreign inspections. It has been our experience that persons associated with the laboratory are normally fluent in the English language.\n21. What kind of training does an FDA investigator have which qualifies him/her to conduct a GLP inspection or data audit? Does the investigator draw conclusions from his observations regarding the competence of the laboratory or quality of the studies? Along with education in one of the natural or physical sciences, the individuals selected to conduct GLP inspections generally have had considerable experience inspecting facilities involved in drug manufacturing, biologics production, medical device assembly, food processing, and a range of other operations on products regulated by the Agency. In addition, the investigators conducting nonclinical laboratory inspections (GLPs) have undergone intensive training in the normal operating procedures of nonclinical testing facilities. This training which includes a full review of the Agency's policies and of the GLP regulations National Center for Toxicological Research accomplished at FDA's National located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Field investigators are encouraged to contact any resource within the Agency, i.e., scientists and other personnel of the various bureaus to resolve scientific questions that may arise during an inspection. Bureau scientists and not the investigators, draw conclusions regarding the competence of the laboratory of the quality of the study\n22. Does a laboratory manager have the right to ask for the FDA investigator's educational and experience qualifications prior to a GLP inspection?\n\nYes, questions regarding the formal training, educational experience, and on-the-job training of an individual investigator may be addressed to the investigator prior to a GLP inspection.\n23. What can a laboratory manager do when he encounters an FDA investigator who is overly antagonistic or uncertain as to what he is looking for?\n\nThe Agency makes every effort to promote a professional attitude in its investigators including special training and selection of investigators for this program. However, if in the judgement of the laboratory manager there is a question as to the qualifications or attitude of the investigator, the local FDA district office director should be contacted.\n24. What assurance does a firm have that confidential or trade secret information given to the FDA investigator will be safeguarded by the Agency? What happens when an FOI request for the inspection report is received by FDA?\n\nSection 301(j) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits any employee from revealing for his/her advantage any information obtained in the course of carrying out his/her duties. Trade secrets and confidential commercial information are deleted from documents before they are released under FOI. Inspected firms may help by identifying information, which they consider to be confidential when it is given to the investigator. FDA will however, exercise its own judgment, in accordance with its FOI regulations as to whether such information may properly be classified as confidential.\n25. How can copies of inspection reports be obtained under FOI?\n\nInspection reports may be obtained by making a request under FOI to:\n\nFreedom of Information Staff, HFI-35\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, Maryland 20857\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1976-N-0476-0380)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-1976-N-0476-0380\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1976-N-0476-0380).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.1113467812538147", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: establishment, amendment or revocation of a performance standard;\n\nreview of a PMA or PDP;\n\nreview of the Quality System (formerly Good Manufacturing Practice) regulation;\n\nestablishment of minimum national uniform quality standards for mammography facilities.\n\nNote that all meetings of the Medical Device Advisory Committee Panels are held under Part 14. FDA will publish a notice in the Federal Register of advisory committee meetings. In general, ten copies of written submissions to a committee are to be sent to the executive secretary unless otherwise specified in the Federal Register notice.24 Submissions for a Public Hearing under Part 14 do not need to be sent to FDA's Dockets Management Staff.\n\nFootnote 24: 21 CFR 14.35(a).\n\n4 Public Hearing Before the FDA Commissioner (21 CFR Part 15)\n\nA hearing under Part 15 is held at the discretion of the Commissioner, when provided by law or regulation, or as an alternative to a formal evidentiary hearing (where granted in the discretion of the Commissioner), to permit persons to present information and views at a public hearing on any matter pending before the FDA. Examples of issues that can be referred to a Part 15 hearing include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nProposals to allow persons to order custom devices;\n\nProposed Quality System (formerly Good Manufacturing Practice) Regulation;\n\nProposed exemptions from federal preemption of state and local device requirements.25\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 808.25(e).\n\nFDA will publish a notice of hearing in the Federal Register. The scope of a hearing is determined by the notice of hearing and any regulation under which the hearing is held. A person may submit information or views on the subject of the hearing in writing to FDA's Dockets Management Staff as described previously.26\n\nFootnote 26: 21 CFR 15.25.\n\n5 Regulatory Hearing Before the FDA (21 CFR Part 16)\n\nA hearing under 21 CFR Part 16 (Regulatory Hearing Before the Food and Drug Administration) is called at the discretion of the FDA Commissioner when considering regulatory action, or when provided by law or regulation. Part 16 provides an opportunity for a regulatory hearing on various matters including but not limited to:\n\nSections 520(g)(4) and (g)(5) of the FD&C Act, relating to disapproval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or notice of a proposed withdrawal of approval;\n\n21 CFR 814.46(c), relating to withdrawal of approval of a PMA;\n\nRescission of a 510(k) clearance;\n\nAn order suspending or revoking an FDA certificate issued to a U.S. mammography facility pursuant to the MQSA.\n\nA regulatory hearing is initiated by a notice of opportunity for hearing from FDA. A person offered a hearing has the amount of time specified in the notice to request a hearing. Under 21 CFR 16.26(a), a request for a hearing may be denied if the request fails to demonstrate a genuine and substantial issue of fact that warrants a hearing; therefore, the request should specify the grounds for the hearing request. FDA and the party requesting the hearing will, if feasible, at least one day before the hearing provide to each other written notice of any published articles or written information to be presented or relied on at the hearing. A regulatory hearing is informal and the rules of evidence do not apply.27\n\nFootnote 27: 21 CFR 16.60(c).\n\nVI Judicial Review\n\nFDA is frequently asked about judicial remedies. A party seeking judicial review of a final action taken by FDA should consult its attorney or perform its own research of applicable statutes and regulations. It is not appropriate for FDA to offer advice or assistance concerning whether, and how, a party may seek judicial review of an adverse decision, and nothing in this guidance should be construed as constraining the ability of a stakeholder to exercise any remedies provided by statute or regulation.\n\nIn general, FDA believes it is in the public interest for parties to avail themselves of administrative remedies within the agency prior to engaging in litigation, so that FDA has the opportunity to reconsider and review any dispute concerning an FDA action before it is referred to judicial review.28 In the event that a petitioner brings judicial action relating to a matter that is subject to a pending review under 21 CFR 10.75 or 10.33, or any other administrative process, the Commissioner may request that the court refer the matter back to the Agency or hold its review in abeyance pending completion of administrative reconsideration.29 Moreover, the Commissioner will generally consider a petition for reconsideration only before the petitioner brings legal action in the courts.\n\nFootnote 28: 21 CFR 10.45.\n\nFootnote 29: 21 CFR 10.33(h).\n\nVII Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 8 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

Determining whether an inspection may be needed.\n\nAs with a premarket approval application, a supplemental premarket approval application may be approved if it meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. One such requirement is that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packaging, storage or installation of a device conforms to the requirements of section 520(f) of the FD&C Act. A preapproval inspection for a site change supplement may be necessary for FDA to find that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packaging, storage or installation of the device conform to the requirements of the QS regulation, 21 CFR Part 820. See sections 515(c)(1)(C), 515(d)(2)(C) and 520(f) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. SSS 360e(c)(1)(C), 360e(d)(2)(C) and 360j(f).\n\nCDRH and CBER generally determines whether to conduct an inspection of a new site associated with a site change supplement based upon the following factors:\n\nthe dates of the last inspections of the current site and the new site;\n\nthe classifications of the last inspections of the current site and the new site;\n\nthe relevance of the last QS regulation inspection to the moved manufacturing, processing, or packaging activities (e.g., whether similar products or processes were inspected);\n\na review of relevant recalls and adverse events, associated with manufacturing processes for devices manufactured, processed or packaged at this site; and\n\nthe risk to the safety or effectiveness of the device associated with the manufacturing activities performed at the new site.\n\nCDRH and CBER review the inspectional record to determine the classification of previous inspections. Inspections can be classified as Official Action Indicated (OAI), Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI), or No Action Indicated (NAI). OAI is synonymous with the definition of a Situation I inspection as defined in Part V of FDA's Compliance Program 7382.845, \"Inspection of Medical Device Manufacters.\"15 Situation I indicates one or more major deficiencies with the Quality System regulation such that FDA is prepared to initiate administrative and/or regulatory action, including, but not limited to, issuance of a warning letter, injunction, detention, seizure, civil money penalty, or prosecution. NAI and VAI classifications are generally synonymous with a Situation II inspection, which indicates Quality System deficiencies of a quantity or type to conclude that there is a minimal probability, in light of the relationship between quality system deficiencies observed and the particular device and manufacturing process involved, that the establishment will produce nonconforming or defective finished devices. In Situation II, FDA informs the establishment of any objectionable findings, but generally does not initiate administrative or regulatory action.\n\nFootnote 15: See supra n. 6.\n\nCDRH and CBER intend to consider the factors outlined above in determining the need for an inspection at the time of review. For example, when the new site has not been inspected or the last inspection of either the current or the new site was classified as OAI, then FDA intends to conduct an inspection of the new site if CDRH or CBER reviews the site change supplement and concludes that it is approvable pending a non-violative (Situation II) inspection. Manufacturers may contact the appropriate office to discuss whether a pre-approval inspection may be required; the pre-submission process may be utilized for these interactions, if appropriate.16\n\nFootnote 16: For more information on requests for feedback on medical device submissions, please refer to FDA\u2019s final guidance, Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm07795.pdf\n\nVI Resources\n\nThe following are resources that may be of assistance in developing the content of your site change supplement or 30-day notice, preparing for an inspection, or in performing process validation:\n\nQuality System Information for Certain Premarket Application Reviews; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm070899.pdfhttps://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocumen ts/UCM070899\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff; The Review and Inspection of Premarket Approval Application Manufacturing Information and Operations, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm077795.pdf\n\nGuidance for Industry; Process Validation: General Principles and Practices, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM070336.pdf.\n\nMedical Devices; Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Final Rule; Quality System Regulation, 61 FR 52602, October 7, 1996, available at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/PostmarketRequirements/QualitySystemsRegulations/ucm230127.htm.\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff: 30-Day Notices, 135-Day Premarket Approval (PMA) Supplements, and 75-Day Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Supplements for Manufacturing Method or Process Changes, available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM080194.pdf\n\nOEI (Official Establishment Inventory) Development and Maintenance Procedures, available at http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/FieldManagementDirectives/ucm096034.htm.\n\nCompliance Program Guidance Manual, Inspection of Medical Device Manufacturers.

If the CFG is denied because such establishment is found to be out of compliance, the CFG requestor will receive a denial email indicating that the denial is based on matters pertaining to that establishment. However, pursuant to applicable disclosure requirements,9 the substantive summary will not be emailed to the CFG requestor, but to the out-of-compliance establishment via the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment, if the CFG requestor agrees that its pending CFG request can be made known to the other establishment.\n\nFootnote 8: See section 801(e)(4)(E)(i)(I) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 381(e)(4)(E)(i)(II).\n\nFootnote 9: Trade secrets and confidential commercial information (CCI) are protected from public disclosure by the Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905), Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552(b)(4)), and FDA\u2019s disclosure regulations (21 CFR 20.61).\n\nFor open recalls, the Agency intends to base its decision to issue a CFG on the current status of the recalled products. For example, if a party requests a CFG for a recalled product that has been reworked, FDA will review documentation of the rework and final testing of the product, per the current recall review process, to determine whether a CFG should be issued.\n\nFor a product line with an open lot-specific recall, lots not under recall may be included on a CFG provided the firm signs a statement indicating that it will not ship the lots of the product that are subject to the recall.\n\n2 Plan of Correction\n\nThe firm may submit a plan of correction after it has received the substantive summary of the specific grounds for noncompliance (reason 4, described above). Section 801(e)(4)(E)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act provides that FDA shall not deny a request for a CFG based solely on the grounds that the device at issue was manufactured in an establishment that has received an FDA Inspectional Observations form (Form FDA 483), issued under section 704(b) of the FD&C Act, if the FDA and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of such establishment have agreed to a plan of correction in response to the report. For purposes of this guidance, FDA interprets \"plan of correction\" to mean a response to an FDA Inspectional Observations, issued under section 704(b) of the FD&C Act.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor FDA and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment to agree on a plan of correction in response to the inspectional observations, for CFG consideration, the following steps should occur:\n\nThe owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment should submit, via email, a plan that includes steps the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment is taking to address, and prevent the recurrence of, the inspectional observations, and timeframes for completing such actions. This \"plan of correction\" should also include documentation demonstrating the corrective/preventative actions that have been taken and/or will be taken. * To submit a plan of correction, the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment should email the FDA contact identified by the investigator at the end of the inspection for submission of a response to the Form FDA 483. * The email subject line should clearly state \"Plan of Correction,\" along with the establishment name and FDA Establishment Identifier (FEI) number.\n\nThe FDA will review the plan and notify the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment via email whether the plan is sufficient to address the violations documented in the inspectional observations. If the Agency finds that clarification on the submitted plan of correction is needed, the Agency may, at its discretion, initiate further communication with the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment prior to making a decision. Generally, depending upon the Agency's resources, the complexity of the noncompliance issues presented, and the responsiveness of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment, FDA intends to provide a response to a plan of correction within 90 days.\n\nIf the plan is determined to be sufficient, and a CFG application is currently under review10 or subsequently submitted to the Agency, FDA will issue a CFG, if no other grounds for denial are present. Footnote 10: The FD@C Act limits the processing of a CFG request to within 20 working days of receipt of the request (section 801(e)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD@C Act; 21 U.S.C. 381(e)(4)(A)(ii)). As such, it may be necessary for the establishment to submit a new CFG application. As indicated in the Guidance \u201cFDA Export Certificates\u201d (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/fda-export-certificates), the FDA \u201chas interpreted the 20-day period to mean 20 government working days.\u201d\n\nIf an establishment is implementing a plan of correction and determines that modifications to the plan are necessary, it should notify FDA of the modifications via the previously identified contact information.\n\n3 Review of FDA Denial of a CFG Request\n\nThe CDRH Exports Team and the CBER Import and Export Staff will make every effort to directly resolve issues. In addition, the statute provides that persons denied a CFG may requestreview of the Agency's decision, and outlines two distinct types of review. The process for requesting such reviews is outlined below.\n\nAppendix A Review Pursuant to Section 801(e)(4)(E)(ii)(I)\n\nSection 801(e)(4)(E)(ii)(I) directs the FDA to provide a process for a person who is denied a CFG for a device to request a review that conforms to the standards of section 517A(b) of the FD&C Act. CDRH's review process11 follows the standards of section 517A by providing for supervisory review, opportunity for a meeting or teleconference, and timeframes, except it does not adopt the specific timeframes set forth in section 517A(b)(2)&(3). FDA will strive to meet the timeframes outlined in 517A(b)(3); however, efforts to resolve any issues raised by a person whose request for a CFG is denied may take up to, or more than, 30 days to be completed. In addition, since the denial of a request to issue a CFG is not a \"significant decision\" as defined in section 517A(a)(1), CDRH's review process will not include the 30-day timeframe for submitting a request for review. Similarly, CBER will use the Formal Dispute Resolution process12 for submitting a request for review, but the efforts by the CBER Import and Export Staff to resolve any issues raised by a person whose request for a CFG is denied may take up to, or more than, 30 days to be completed.\n\nFootnote 11: For additional information regarding appeal review processes in CDRH, specifically appeals of actions that are not significant decisions, please see the guidance \u201cCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes,\u201d available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/center-devices-and-radiological-health-cdrh-appeals-processes.\n\nFootnote 12: For additional information regarding appeal review processes in CBER, please see the guidance, \u201cFormal Dispute Resolution: Sponsor Appeals Above the Division Level,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/formal-dispute-resolution-sponsor-appeals-above-division-level-guidance-industry-and-review-staff.\n\nThe request for a review of FDA's decision not to issue a CFG should be submitted no later than 60 calendar days from the denial date by emailing the Exports Team within CDRH's Office of Regulatory Programs (ORP), Division of Establishment Support using exportcert@cdrh.fda.gov, or the CBER ombudsman using cberombudsman@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nA request for review of a CFG denial should include the following:\n\nAn email subject line that states: \"Request for Review of FDA's Decision to Deny a CFG\" and the CFG application number;\n\nThe name, title, firm, address, phone number, and email address of the person submitting the request;\n\nThe name, address, and FEI number of the establishment for which the CFG was denied;\n\nA clear reference to the inspectional observation(s) as noted in the substantive summary of the denial; and * Information demonstrating why the request for CFG should not have been denied, referencing previously submitted documentation.\n\nThis review process consists of a supervisory review, including an in-person meeting or teleconference, if requested.\n\nAppendix B Review of New Information Pursuant to Section 801(e)(4)(E)(ii)(II)\n\nA person who has been denied a CFG \"may at any time request a review in order to present new information relating to actions taken by such person to address the reasons identified by [FDA] for the denial of [the CFG], including evidence that corrective actions are being or have been implemented to address grounds for noncompliance identified by [FDA]\" (section 801(e)(4)(E)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 381(e)(4)(E)(ii)(II)).\n\nThe owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment can request such a review by contacting the Exports Team within CDRH's Office of Regulatory Programs (ORP), Division of Establishment Support by email at exportcert(@cdrh.fda.gov or CBER Import and Export Staff within the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality (OCBQ), Division of Case Management (DCM) at CBERBECATS@fda.hhs.gov. A person requesting a review of new information should reference, but need not re-submit, inspection related documentation previously submitted to the FDA.\n--------------------\nContext title: Process to Request a Review of FDA's Decision Not to Issue Certain Export Certificates for Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.596558094024658", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: A prompt evaluation by a qualified person and following established criteria, to ensure that potential risks are consistently and adequately assessed and investigated for products potentially affected.\n\nThe recalling firm need not delay initiation of a voluntary recall pending completion of the investigation.\n\nMake decisions and take action.The firm's procedures should assign responsibility and describe the steps to ensure that decisions are made to control defective and potentially harmful products in a timely manner.The procedures should address:\n\nDeciding whether to initiate a voluntary recall.\n\nThe appropriate scope of the recall, e.g., the groups of units to be recalled as identified by product coding, or in instances where the product does not bear a code, a description of the units distributed within a specific date range or period of time.For guidance on adequate product coding, see Question A in section III of this document.\n\nThe appropriate depth of the recall, i.e., depending on the product's degree of hazard and extent of distribution, the firm's recall strategy should specify the level in the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend. (21 CFR 7.42(b)(1)).\n\nThe need to discontinue production and distribution of affected product.\n\nConsult with FDA about the problem.If a firm has questions about its examination of a product problem, we encourage the firm to consult with FDA while its own investigation is ongoing.A comprehensive list of FDA Recall Coordinator contact information, organized by product type and location, is available on FDA's website.29\n\n3 How should a firm initiate a voluntary recall?\n\nA firm should initiate a voluntary recall by promptly notifying each of its affected direct accounts about the recall, and by issuing a press release or other public notice, if appropriate. FDA considers the date of a firm's first communication about a recall, either to its direct accounts or to the public, to constitute the date of initiation.\n\nWe recommend that the recalling firm follow the initiation procedures in its recall plan to implement the recall in accordance with 21 CFR 7.46 (firm-initiated recall). This includes executing its prepared recall communications plan. Among the information generally requested by the FDA under 21 CFR 7.46(a) are copies of the firm's issued or proposed recall communications. If provided, FDA will review the content of the proposed communications and recommend changes as appropriate.\n\nA recalling firm need not delay initiation of a voluntary recall pending FDA's review of its recall strategy or recall communications. Section 7.49(c) of 21 CFR provides general content guidelines for recall communications.30\n\nFootnote 30: See also supra footnote 6 and accompanying text.\n\nIn addition, a recalling firm should clearly identify the level in the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend and should provide instructions to direct accounts to extend the recall to their own direct accounts if the product could have been further distributed. We have previously issued procedural guidance regarding press releases and written recall notification letters.31 Nevertheless, and notwithstanding any requirements for firms to submit a report to FDA for certain products, a firm that initiates a recall because it believes the product to be violative is requested to notify FDA immediately. (21 CFR 7.46(a)).32\n\nFootnote 31: Information on Recalls of FDA Regulated Products, https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/industry-guidance-recalls\n\nFootnote 32: But see footnote 33.\n\nAs appropriate, a recipient of a recall communication, i.e., a notified direct account or consignee, should implement its own recall initiation procedures to extend the recall promptly to its direct accounts that may have received the affected product, in accordance with the instructions received from the recalling firm. (See 21 CFR 7.49(d)). Where necessary, follow-up communication should occur for any direct account that fails to respond to a recall communication to ensure the direct account has received and understands the recall communication. (See 21 CFR 7.49(c)(2)).\n\n4 How does FDA work with a recalling firm to initiate a voluntary recall in a timely manner?\n\nFDA is committed to working cooperatively with a recalling firm whenever possible to facilitate the orderly and prompt removal of, or correction to, a violative product in the marketplace, particularly when the product presents a danger to public health. FDA recall coordinators organized by product type (e.g., a food, drug, medical device, or tobacco product) and located throughout the country, act as Agency points-of-contact for recalling firms and offer assistance. Recall coordinators provide a recalling firm with information about the recall process and are available to work closely with the firm throughout the course of the recall. For example, recall coordinators may assist the firm with determining whether the action is a recall as defined in 21CFR 7.3(g), and if so, with developing an appropriate recall strategy; with reviewing the recalling firm's communications to direct accounts or to the public about the recall; and with monitoring the destruction, reconditioning, or disposition of the recalled product. For certain products, FDA recall coordinators may assist by referring the firm to another regulatory body outside FDA with primary responsibility for monitoring the product recall (e.g., voluntary recalls of certain alcoholic beverages are monitored by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau).\n\nA recalling firm located in the United States should contact a Division Recall Coordinator within the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA).33 If the firm is located outside of the United States and is recalling a product exported to the United States, then the recalling firm should contact ORA Headquarters. A comprehensive list of FDA Recall Coordinator contact information, organized by product type and location, is available on FDA's website.34\n\nFDA officials may initiate discussions with a firm about a product problem. When FDA determines that a distributed product violates the law, it may inform the firm and may recommend that it cease distribution and recall the product in accordance with 21 CFR part 7 and Agency procedures. If the firm voluntarily decides under any circumstances to recall the product, then the action is considered a firm-initiated recall under 21 CFR 7.46.\n\nFootnote 33: For recalls of CBER-regulated products included in CBER\u2019s Direct Recall Classification (DRC) program, the DRC program is the primary means by which firms communicate with FDA regarding the recall. The DRC program refers to the classification of biologics recalls directly by personnel in CBER. Further information on the DRC program may be found at: https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/report-problem-center-biologics-evaluation-research/direct-recall-classification-program\n\nUnder certain circumstances, FDA may also request that a firm initiate a recall under 21 CFR 7.45.35 FDA-requested recall is generally pursued only after conducting discussions with the firm. FDA must make all of the following determinations before requesting a recall under 21 CFR 7.45:\n\nFootnote 34: ORA Recall Coordinators, https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/ora-recall-coordinators\n\nThat a product that has been distributed presents a risk of illness or injury or gross consumer deception;\n\nThat the firm has not initiated a recall of the product; and\n\nThat an Agency action is necessary to protect the public health and welfare.\n\nDuring an FDA-requested recall the recalling firm may be asked to provide FDA with any or all information listed in 21 CFR 7.46(a). This information includes, but is not limited to, the identity of the product involved, the reason for the removal or correction, and the date and circumstances under which the product deficiency or possible deficiency was discovered. If the firm agrees to recall the product based on FDA's request, then the action is still considered a voluntary recall.\n\nIn the event that a recalling firm's actions do not adequately protect the public from a violative product, i.e., the firm fails to initiate a recall effectively, FDA may consider taking other appropriate actions.\n--------------------\nContext title: Initiation of Voluntary Recalls Under 21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.844658374786377", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:... (e) The refusal to permit access to or copying of any record as required by section... 704(a).... (f) The refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704.\u201d Section 303 (21 U.S.C 333) provides penalties for violations of Section 301.\n\n3 Delay of Inspections\n\nDelays may occur for many reasons, some of which are beyond the control of the facility. However, where an owner, operator, or agent causes the delay of an inspection, this may cause the drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\n4 Delay Scheduling Pre-announced Inspections\n\nThe FD&C Act does not require FDA to pre-announce its inspections. Therefore, FDA usually does not pre-announce for-cause and routine surveillance inspections. It is, however, FDA'sgeneral practice to contact the firm before an investigator arrives at the inspection site for pre-approval and pre-license inspections, and most inspections of foreign facilities of drug products. This pre-announcement, although not required, is intended to facilitate the inspection process and ensure that appropriate records and personnel will be made available.\n\nFDA's efforts to schedule pre-announced inspections include sending correspondence to the facility's point of contact e-mail address, including the facility's U.S. agent if the facility is a foreign facility. FDA will make reasonable accommodations for local conditions, such as weather or security situations, holidays, and other non-work days, and, where appropriate, scheduled manufacturing campaigns. Examples of delay in scheduling a pre-announced inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility will not agree to a proposed inspection start date and does not give a reasonable explanation for its failure to do so.\n\nAfter scheduling an inspection, a facility requests a later start date without giving a reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility fails to respond following FDA's attempt to contact the facility's designated contact(s).\n\nAn example of a potentially reasonable explanation that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act includes, but is not limited to:\n\nManufacturing at the facility is not on-going, for example running only one manufacturing campaign per month and the facility requests a different date than that proposed by or agreed to by FDA so that manufacturing will occur during the FDA inspection of the facility.\n\n2 Delay During an Inspection\n\nAn FDA inspection is intended to enable the Agency to review a facility's compliance with certain laws and regulations. In a drug facility, FDA has broad authority to inspect things that bear on whether the drugs are adulterated, misbranded, or are otherwise in violation of the FD&C Act. Actions by a facility's owner, operator, or agent before or after the beginning of an inspection that impede an FDA investigator at the inspection site from performing the inspection in a reasonable manner may be considered delaying the inspection. FDA is aware that its appearance on-site may initially cause some minor confusion and/or inconveniences to the facility's employees. Minor delays that result from good faith efforts by the facility to comply with FDA requests generally would not be considered unreasonable. Examples of delays during an inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator access to an area of the facility until a specific future date or time even though the area is operational and is an area of the inspection site that FDA has authority to inspect, without giving a reasonable explanation.\n\n2.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA facility leaves the FDA investigator in a conference room without access to necessary documentation or responsible individuals for an unreasonable period of time that interferes with the investigator's ability to complete the inspection.\n\nAn example of a potentially reasonable explanation that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act includes, but is not limited to:\n\nA facility does not provide the FDA investigator access to aseptic processing areas until the investigator accommodates the facility's documented governing procedures.\n\nDelay Producing Records\n\nA critical aspect of FDA's preparation for inspection and inspection of drug facilities is the review and collection of hardcopy and electronic records, files, and papers bearing on whether the drugs are adulterated, misbranded, or are otherwise in violation of the FD&C Act. For example, records may be reviewed to verify compliance, but may also need to be collected to document evidence of deviations, interstate commerce, product labeling and promotion, and to identify the party or parties responsible for a variety of actions. Although FDA recognizes that facilities require a reasonable amount of time to produce records requested, especially if the records are maintained at a different site, a delay in producing records to FDA without reasonable explanation may be considered delaying the inspection. Examples of delays in producing records that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nDuring an inspection, the FDA investigator requests, within a specific, reasonable timeframe, records that FDA has authority to inspect, but the facility fails to produce the requested records within the timeframe requested by FDA, without reasonable explanation.\n\nFDA requests records pursuant to section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, but the facility fails to produce the requested records in a timely manner, without reasonable explanation.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe FDA investigator requests translation of the records into English, and the translation is not readily available.\n\nThe records requested are not available at that time because they are being used for a manufacturing operation that is in progress.\n\nThe volume of the records requested is sufficiently large as to require reasonable time to compile.\n\nIn instances where the facility provides a reasonable explanation for delaying production of records, the facility should also ensure that the resulting delay is of a reasonable duration.\n\nIV Denial of Inspection\n\nFDA interprets the word deny to include active behavior by the owner, operator, or agent of a drug facility to prevent an authorized representative of the FDA from conducting an inspection or to prevent FDA from completing an inspection. This includes statements or physical actions intended to avoid inspection or to mislead, deceive, or impede the investigator. Examples of behavior that may constitute a denial that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility rejects FDA's attempt to schedule a pre-announced inspection.\n\nUpon arrival at the facility, the facility does not allow the FDA investigator to begin the inspection.\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator to inspect the facility because certain staff members are not present, without a reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator to inspect the facility by falsely alleging the facility does not manufacture, process, pack, or hold drugs.\n\nA facility sends staff home for the day and tells the FDA investigator that the facility is not producing any product.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nAt the beginning of an unannounced inspection, appropriate personnel are not immediately available to accurately answer the FDA investigator's questions.\n\nThe FDA investigator arrives for an unannounced inspection, but the facility is closed due to scheduled maintenance.\n\nV Limiting of Inspection\n\nAn owner, operator, or agent of a drug facility who prevents an authorized representative of the FDA from conducting an inspection to the extent allowable under the law may be viewed as limiting inspection under section 501(j). Below are examples of behavior that FDA considers to constitute a limitation that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\nLimiting Access to Facilities and/or Manufacturing Processes\n\nPreventing an authorized representative of the FDA reasonable access to an area of the site that FDA is entitled to inspect may be considered limiting the inspection. This includes the refusal to disclose or permit observation of the manufacturing processes. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility orders the discontinuation of all manufacturing for the duration of the FDA inspection without a reasonable explanation.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA facility states that direct observation of the manufacturing process, in whole or in part, must be limited to an unreasonably short amount of time, thus preventing FDA from inspecting the facility as is usual and customary.\n\nA facility limits direct observation of portions of the manufacturing process without reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility unreasonably restricts entry to a particular portion of the facility without reasonable explanation.\n\nStaff at a facility causes the FDA investigator to leave the premises before the inspection is completed.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n--------------------\nContext title: Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.884777545928955"], "In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.

The separate dedicated building configuration is not intended to accommodate the manufacturing of multiple products using spore-formers. If multiple products are manufactured in the same area or within the same building using spore-formers, then additional criteria will apply. See SS 600.11(e)(3)(ii) and section V. below.\n\nContainment\n\nBuilding Construction and Configuration\n\nIf you choose to use a separate dedicated building configuration for manufacturing processes involving spore-formers, your building must be constructed to prevent contamination. (SS 600.11(e)(3)(i)). Your separate dedicated building should be constructed with walls that extend to the ceiling with properly sealed joints at wall/ceiling intersections, separate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), water drops, sewer line, and an independent entrance thereby containing the building from surrounding areas.\n\nWe recommend that all surfaces be solid, hard, non-porous, and cleanable, including ceilings and walls. To the extent you are using aseptic processing, floors, walls, and ceilings should have smooth, hard surfaces that are easily cleanable.2\n\nFootnote 2: Please refer to FDA\u2019s guidance for industry entitled \u201cSterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing \u2013 Current Good Manufacturing Practice,\u201d dated September 2004 (October 4, 2004, 69 FR 59258) (http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5882fnl.htm), for the agency\u2019s current thinking on aseptic processing.\n\nAir Handling Units (AHUs)\n\nAHUs should not be shared with other buildings. Dedicated re-circulating AHUs are acceptable within the separate dedicated building. We recommend that exhaust not be located near other AHU intakes. We also recommend that youconsider using high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration of exhaust, and that you maintain the building at negative pressure with respect to the outside environment and/or adjacent areas.\n3. Equipment Dedication If you choose a separate dedicated building configuration, major equipment should be identified as used for manufacturing with the particular spore-former. We recommend that you dedicate all equipment.\n2. Procedural Control 1. Personnel Gowning and Flows Personnel who work in manufacturing using spore-formers must complete an outer covering change or wear protective covering prior to entering areas where other products are manufactured ($ 600.10(c)(3)). We also recommend that personnel shower and complete a \"clean\" clothing change prior to entering other areas or interacting with personnel not directly involved in the manufacturing of spore-formers.\n3. Material Transfer Any material transferred out of a spore-former manufacturing area that may cross-contaminate other products, product containers, intermediates, or materials used in the manufacturing of other products should be decontaminated via a decontamination chamber prior to exiting. If a decontamination chamber is not feasible, then a series of airlocks utilizing surface decontamination with an appropriate agent may be acceptable. When utilizing a decontamination chamber system such as an autoclave, sterilize-in-place (SIP) cycle, or gas chamber, the decontamination cycle should be validated using methodologies that ensure that the spore-former would be inactivated. We recommend that you incorporate a worst-case approach. You should not use the same chamber for both the decontamination of the spore-former and the sterilization of other production items. When it is necessary to employ an airlock system for decontamination of material that is transferred out of a manufacturing area, your procedures should provide for the decontamination process. Use of a liquid or gaseous agent to inactivate the spore-formers and decontamination agent efficacy studies are recommended. We recommend that you incorporate a worst-case approach. We also recommend that you consider parameters that include the composition of the material, exposure time, concentration, pH, temperature and any other relevant factors. If the airlock system involves only local decontamination of the equipment or item, such as wipe downs, then we recommend that the decontamination process be conductedand validated in series (multiple airlocks) to ensure that no trailing contamination is encountered. We recommend that inside personnel pass the outgoing material and/or equipment into an interior material airlock (i.e., Material Airlock (Primary Decontamination) as shown in the Appendix), where they decontaminate the items according to approved validated procedures. After initial decontamination, the inside personnel transfer the outgoing items into an exterior material airlock (i.e., Material Airlock (Secondary Decontamination) as shown in the Appendix). The outside personnel then provide a second decontamination step (also validated) on the outgoing items, and then transfer the material and/or equipment into an exit corridor or room. We recommend that temporal separation between personnel be maintained and that personnel not use material airlocks for exiting (see Appendix).\n\nEquipment Cleaning\n\nNo special equipment cleaning is needed, beyond what SS 600.11(b) requires, when manufacturing with spore-formers, provided that the equipment is maintained within the dedicated processing area.\n\nWaste Disposal\n\nProcess waste can be treated in a similar fashion as the material transferred out of the manufacturing area or processed through a validated bio-waste system. When waste is transferred out of the manufacturing area, we recommend that it be transferred out in biohazard bags via multiple airlocks in a manner similar to the material transfer process described in section IV.A.2.b. We recommend that waste be bagged in the processing room and transferred to the interior material airlock where the outside of the bag is decontaminated by the inside personnel. After the initial decontamination, inside personnel places the bagged waste into another biohazard bag and transfers it into the exterior material airlock. Outside personnel decontaminates the outside of the second biohazard bag and removes the double-bagged waste from the exterior material airlock (see Appendix).\n\nAll waste must be disposed of in a manner that is in compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws.\n\nV Manufacturing With Spore-Formers in a Multiproduct Manufacturing Building: Process Containment\n\nProcess containment is designed to isolate equipment or an area that involves manufacturing using spore-forming microorganisms mechanically (Containment) and procedurally (Procedural Control). This manufacturing area, including biological intermediates or biological drug substances, equipment, or material storage in that area, must not be used for any other purpose during the processing period (SS 600.11(e)(3)(ii)). The manufacturing area should contain adequate space for the orderly placement of equipment. If you intend to use an area for manufacturing spore-formers and other products on a campaign basis, then you must develop and implement procedures to demonstrate containment and decontamination before initiating processing of other products in that manufacturing area (SS 600.11(e)(3)(ii)). These procedures must, at a minimum, provide for containment, environmental monitoring specific for the spore-former, cleaning, decontamination, and movement of materials in and out of that area (SS 600.11(e)(3)(ii)). We recommend that you implement campaign changeover procedures whenever an area that was previously used for a spore-forming microorganism will subsequently be used for manufacturing other products.\n\nPhysical Establishment and Equipment\n\nContainment a Building Construction and Configuration We recommend that the manufacturing areas used for spore-forming microorganisms have double serial entry, exit, and material airlocks to minimize the potential for cross-contamination via personnel, materials, and air turbulence. As shown in the Appendix, the interior airlocks would serve as an air sink for the primary decontamination step. The three air sinks shown in the Appendix include the final gowning step (Gown-in (Final)), the gross de-gowning step (Gown-out (Initial)), and the interior material airlock (Material Airlock (Primary Decontamination)). The exterior airlocks would serve as an air dome for the preliminary gowning step. The air domes shown in the Appendix include primary decontamination (Gown-in (Preliminary)), the final de-gowning step (Gown-out (Final)), and the secondary decontamination step (Material Airlock (Secondary Decontamination)).\n\nWe recommend that all surfaces be solid, hard, non-porous, and cleanable, including ceilings and walls. To the extent you are using aseptic processing, floors, walls, and ceilings should have smooth, hard surfaces that are easily cleanable. We recommend that the final ceiling and wall finishes minimize air leaks.\n\nYour procedures should provide for the decontamination of all tables, shelving, and storage apparatus.\n\nAir Handling Units (AHUs) We recommend that AHUs using 100% single-pass air be used within the area where manufacturing with spore-forming microorganisms occurs and that the area be maintained at a negative air pressure to all surrounding areas, including ceilings and mechanical spaces. We recommend that exhaust not be located near other AHU intakes, and that HEPA filtration of exhaust be considered.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.1 Equipment Dedication\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Manufacturing Biological Intermediates and Biological Drug Substances Using Spore-Forming Microorganisms \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.393437147140503", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: 3 Equipment\n\nYou should adequately calibrate and qualify equipment used for harvesting and/or processing of xenogeneic cells and tissues. You should then routinely monitor temperature-controlled equipment, such as refrigerators/freezers and incubators, to assure proper conditions. Carbon dioxide supplied to incubators used for cell expansion should be 0.2 micron filtered to minimize the potential for contamination. If water baths are used, you should use maintenance procedures for water quality. This may include the addition of agents to control contamination.\n\n4 Aseptic Processing\n\nGenerally, manipulation or expansion of xenogeneic cells or tissues is an entirely aseptic process, i.e., there is no final sterilizing filtration of the product. In order to validate this process, you should perform media fills (substitution of media for product) to demonstrate that sterility may be maintained consistently. Assurance of sterility of the final product is necessary from the very beginning of the clinical studies[32]. You should adequately train and monitor personnel performing these functions to assure consistent performance during normal production.\n\nAll product contact equipment should be sterile and free of pyrogens when aseptically processing cells or tissues. You may use disposable labware where possible. The sterility and depyrogenicity of the containers and closures used for the final product are of particular importance. For equipment and components that are to be sterilized, there should be evidence that the autoclave cycle(s) is validated to provide an acceptable level of sterility assurance. Minimally, you should establish and follow basic load configurations, and you should place biological indicators within each load to verify lethality. As studies progress, we expect that formal validation of all sterilizing/depyrogenating processes will be performed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProcess Validation\n\nUltimately, before licensure or product approval, you should validate all critical processes used to manufacture the product. We have previously defined process validation.[7, 32] We expect that process validation, when performed, will be prospective and at full scale, with the exception of studies performed to demonstrate viral clearance (removal/inactivation). Laboratory studies may also help to establish appropriate operating and process parameters and may be used in support of the formal study. We expect that information on the validation protocol(s) and summaries of data resulting from its execution will be included in the license application.\n\n12 Preclinical Considerations for Xenotransplantation\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nThis section provides a general framework for the preclinical testing of xenotransplantation products before use in clinical trials. You may also apply the general principles as set forth in the document generated by the ICH on the safety of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals to these products (see reference[53]). In general, studies to support the safety characterization of therapeutic agents should focus on the intended alteration to the human pathophysiologic state (i.e., activity) as well as unintended effects (i.e., toxicity) to the host system. Such studies serve to assess the potential for clinical risks and constitute an important component of an FDA regulatory application. Preclinical studies are particularly valuable for gaining insight into safety issues which cannot be evaluated in human recipients for ethical or practical reasons. Consequently, you should design strong preclinical safety programs and also consult the FDA \"Guidance for Industry: Preclinical Assessment of Investigational Cellular and Gene Therapy Products.\"[34]\n\nSpecific considerations in the design of preclinical studies that are intended to support the safety of xenotransplantation products should include:\n\nthe animal source for the xenotransplantation product;\n\nthe tissue's anatomic and physiologic similarity to its human homologue;\n\nthe determination of function of the xenotransplantation product;\n\nthe animal model system;\n\nthe integrity of the device components (if a device is used);\n\nthe dose levels (based on tissue mass as well as pharmacologic/metabolic activity or release kinetics of bioactive molecules);* 7. the route of administration (site of implantation/injection, extracorporeal or ex vivo use);\n\nthe study duration (as related to potential human exposure);\n\nreactions between source animal and host immune systems;\n\ninterspecies extrapolation (i.e., cross-species activity of secreted proteins/hormones at receptors); and\n\ndevice biocompatibility.\n\nSince a primary intent of the preclinical animal and in vitro studies is to identify potential clinical risk factors, these evaluations should focus on maximizing the similarity between animal and human testing strategies in test substance, route of administration, and dosing regimen. Animal models of xenotransplantation should utilize a xenotransplantation system evaluating the cell, tissue, or organ type being examined for use in humans and should utilize clinically relevant immunosuppressive therapy. Rigorous preclinical program design is needed to ensure comparability of preclinical to clinical study design and is important for planning the clinical testing program, including selecting an appropriate clinical indication, inclusion/exclusion criteria, recipient monitoring scheme, dose, and concomitant therapies, as well as for advising potential recipients of risks (informed consent).\n\nAppendix B Issues Related to Infectious Agents\n\nSince the transfer of infectious agents that are pathogenic, latent, or even non-pathogenic in their natural animal host may cause serious disease in an immunosuppressive patient, you should consider the microbiologic burden carried by the xenotransplantation product as well as the immune status of the recipient in preclinical study designs. Additionally, designs of preclinical studies should incorporate:\n\ncareful veterinary monitoring of animals, taking note of any early signs of infection; and\n\nprocedures needed to assign a cause of mortality (using appropriate serologic or immunohistochemical identification of pathogens).\n\nTo prevent the spread of demonstrable or potential infectious agents, you should care for animals with appropriate precautions, including isolation if necessary. Deaths from infections in animal models may occur, due to immunosuppressive regimens that may be intentionally more extreme than expected for use in humans in order to avoid rejection of the xenogeneic live cells, tissues, or organs, and to obtain proof-of-concept data. Therefore, data identifying cause of death (e.g., xenogeneic infectious agents or activation of latent host infection) could assist in interpreting human risk, may be helpful in refining animal experimental models, and may identify pathogenic infectious agents in the source animal. Animal models of xenotransplantation, while exploring these issues, are limited by uncertainties in extrapolation of cross-species infectivity information; e.g., data indicating no infections in animal, even primate species, are not adequate to assure that humans will not be susceptible to infections transmitted by the xenotransplantation product.\n\nAdditional insight into refinements of animal immunosuppressiveant regimens may come from evaluation of host resistance. You may evaluate host immunocompetent by measuring resistance to infection by various pathogens, including those that may be contained within the xenotransplantation product.\n\nXenotransplantation Product-Host Interactions\n\nImmunologic Rejection You should assess survival of the xenogeneic cells, tissues, or organs in animal models, with attention given to: 1. identifying infiltration of immune or inflammatory cells into the xenotransplantation product or alteration of such cells in other relevant compartments, such as the blood and cerebrospinal fluid; 2. fibrotic encapsulation of the xenotransplantation product, e.g., resulting in impaired function or xenotransplantation product loss; 3. xenotransplantation product necrosis; 4. any evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD); 5. in vivo function and durability of encapsulation or barriers intended to diminish rejection or inflammatory responses; 6. any special concerns, regarding the site and nature of the xenotransplantation product; and 7. if relevant to the particular xenotransplantation product, the possibility that rejection of that product might predispose the recipient to rejection of subsequent xenotransplantation products or allotransplants.\n\nImmunosuppression Preclinical animal studies in which xenotransplantation is used in an immunosuppressed host may raise questions, regarding the relevance of the model to clinical pharmacology, toxicology, or immunology. Consideration of how both the host and source species handle the immunosuppressive drugs may be necessary (for instance, where a nephrotoxic drug is metabolized by hepatic enzymes), but intra-species differences in metabolism exist. Immunosuppressive drugs often have very restricted therapeutic indices so that pharmacokinetics and metabolism may markedly affect the activity and/or toxicity of the agents in the host or xenotransplantation products. You should attempt to delineate toxicities due to immunosuppressive drugs from toxicities due to the xenotransplantation product.\n\nYou should consider and study, where appropriate, relative activity of immunosuppression on the source species of the live xenogeneic cells, tissues, or organs since immunosuppressive treatment that selectively suppresses immunity in the host species may be permissive to GVHD. This might occur in cases where immunologically active cells are contained, either intentionally or inadvertently, within the xenotransplantation product.\n\nTumorigenicity in the Immunosuppressed Host\n--------------------\nContext title: Source Animal, Product, Preclinical, and Clinical Issues Concerning the Use of Xenotransplantation Products in Humans Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.096062660217285", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: 12.75 Equipment cleaning/sanitization studies should address microbiological and endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile products).\n12.76 Cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after validation to ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine production. Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual examination, where feasible. Visual inspection can allow detection of gross contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by sampling and/or analysis.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.400235652923584", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Equipment and Facilities (19.3)\n\nDuring all phases of clinical development, including the use of small-scale facilities or laboratories to manufacture batches of APIs for use in clinical trials, procedures should be in place to ensure that equipment is calibrated, clean, and suitable for its intended use. (19.30)\n\nProcedures for the use of facilities should ensure that materials are handled in a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination and cross-contamination. (19.31)\n\nControl of Raw Materials (19.4)\n\nRaw materials used in production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be evaluated by testing, or received with a supplier's analysis and subjected to identity testing. When a material is considered hazardous, a supplier's analysis should suffice. (19.40)\n\nIn some instances, the suitability of a raw material can be determined before use based on acceptability in small-scale reactions (i.e., use testing) rather than on analytical testing alone. (19.41)\n\nProduction (19.5)\n\nThe production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be documented in laboratory notebooks, batch records, or by other appropriate means. These documents should include information on the use of production materials, equipment, processing, and scientific observations. (19.50)\n\nExpected yields can be more variable and less defined than the expected yields used in commercial processes. Investigations into yield variations are not expected. (19.51)\n\nValidation (19.6)\n\nProcess validation for the production of APIs for use in clinical trials is normally inappropriate, where a single API batch is produced or where process changes during API development make batch replication difficult or inexact. The combination of controls, calibration, and, where appropriate, equipment qualification ensures API quality during this development phase. (19.60)\n\nProcess validation should be conducted in accordance with Section 12 when batches are produced for commercial use, even when such batches are produced on a pilot or small scale. (19.61)\nChanges are expected during development, as knowledge is gained and the production is scaled up. Every change in the production, specifications, or test procedures should be adequately recorded. (19.70)\n\nLaboratory Controls (19.8)\n\nWhile analytical methods performed to evaluate a batch of API for clinical trials may not yet be validated, they should be scientifically sound. (19.80)\n\nA system for retaining reserve samples of all batches should be in place. This system should ensure that a sufficient quantity of each reserve sample is retained for an appropriate length of time after approval, termination, or discontinuation of an application. (19.81)\n\nExpiry and retest dating as defined in Section 11.6 applies to existing APIs used in clinical trials. For new APIs, Section 11.6 does not normally apply in early stages of clinical trials. (19.82)\n\nDocumentation (19.9)\n\nA system should be in place to ensure that information gained during the development and the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials is documented and available. (19.90)\n\nThe development and implementation of the analytical methods used to support the release of a batch of API for use in clinical trials should be appropriately documented. (19.91)\n\nA system for retaining production and control records and documents should be used. This system should ensure that records and documents are retained for an appropriate length of time after the approval, termination, or discontinuation of an application. (19.92)\n\nGLOSSARY (20)\n\nAcceptance Criteria: Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of test results.\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) (or Drug Substance): Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a drug (medicinal) product and that, when used in the production of a drug, becomes an active ingredient of the drug product. Such substances are intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure and function of the body.\n\nAPI Starting Material: A raw material, intermediate, or an API that is used in the production of an API and that is incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the API. An API starting material can be an article of commerce, a material purchased from one or more suppliers under contract or commercial agreement, or produced in-house. API starting materials are normally of defined chemical properties and structure.\n\nBatch (or Lot): A specific quantity of material produced in a process or series of processes so that it is expected to be homogeneous within specified limits. In the case of continuous production, a batch may correspond to a defined fraction of the production. The batch size can be defined either by a fixed quantity or by the amount produced in a fixed time interval.\n\nBatch Number (or Lot Number): A unique combination of numbers, letters, and/or symbols that identifies a batch (or lot) and from which the production and distribution history can be determined.\n\nBioburden: The level and type (e.g., objectionable or not) of microorganisms that can be present in raw materials, API starting materials, intermediates or APIs. Bioburden should not be considered contamination unless the levels have been exceeded or defined objectionable organisms have been detected.\n\nCalibration: The demonstration that a particular instrument or device produces results within specified limits by comparison with results produced by a reference or traceable standard over an appropriate range of measurements.\n\nComputer System: A group of hardware components and associated software designed and assembled to perform a specific function or group of functions.\n\nComputerized System: A process or operation integrated with a computer system.\n\nContamination: The undesired introduction of impurities of a chemical or microbiological nature, or of foreign matter, into or onto a raw material, intermediate, or API during production, sampling, packaging, or repackaging, storage or transport.\n\nContract Manufacturer:\n\nA manufacturer who performs some aspect of manufacturing on behalf of the original manufacturer.\n\nCritical:\n\nDescribes a process step, process condition, test requirement, or other relevant parameter or item that must be controlled within predetermined criteria to ensure that the API meets its specification.\n\nCross-Contamination:\n\nContamination of a material or product with another material or product.\n\nDeviation:\n\nDeparture from an approved instruction or established standard.\n\nDrug (Medicinal) Product:\n\nThe dosage form in the final immediate packaging intended for marketing. (Reference Q1A)\n\nDrug Substance:\n\nSee Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient.\n\nExpiry Date (or Expiration Date):\n\nThe date placed on the container/labels of an API designating the time during which the API is expected to remain within established shelf life specifications if stored under defined conditions and after which it should not be used.\n\nImpurity:\n\nAny component present in the intermediate or API that is not the desired entity.\n\nImpurity Profile:\n\nA description of the identified and unidentified impurities present in an API.\n\nIn-Process Control (or Process Control):\n\nChecks performed during production to monitor and, if appropriate, to adjust the process and/or to ensure that the intermediate or API conforms to its specifications.\n\nIntermediate:\n\nA material produced during steps of the processing of an API that undergoes further molecular change or purification before it becomes an API. Intermediates may or may not be isolated. (Note: this guidance only addresses those intermediates produced after the point that a company has defined as the point at which the production of the API begins.)\n\nLot:\n\nSee Batch\n\nLot Number:\n\nSee Batch Number\n\nManufacture:\n\nAll operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, quality control, release, storage, and distribution of APIs and related controls.\n\nMaterial:\n\nA general term used to denote raw materials (starting materials, reagents, solvents), process aids, intermediates, APIs, and packaging and labeling materials.\n\nMother Liquor: The residual liquid that remains after the crystallization or isolation processes. A mother liquor may contain unreacted materials, intermediates, levels of the API, and/or impurities. It can be used for further processing.\n\nPackaging Material: Any material intended to protect an intermediate or API during storage and transport.\n\nProcedure: A documented description of the operations to be performed, the precautions to be taken, and measures to be applied directly or indirectly related to the manufacture of an intermediate or API.\n\nProcess Aids: Materials, excluding solvents, used as an aid in the manufacture of an intermediate or API that do not themselves participate in a chemical or biological reaction (e.g., filter aid, activated carbon).\n\nProcess Control: See In-Process Control.\n\nProduction: All operations involved in the preparation of an API from receipt of materials through processing and packaging of the API.\n\nQualification: Action of proving and documenting that equipment or ancillary systems are properly installed, work correctly, and actually lead to the expected results. Qualification is part of validation, but the individual qualification steps alone do not constitute process validation.\n\nQuality Assurance (QA): The sum total of the organized arrangements made with the object of ensuring that all APIs are of the quality required for their intended use and that quality systems are maintained.\n\nQuality Control (QC): Checking or testing that specifications are met.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.716291904449463"], "As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: The \"Supplement Facts\" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter \"o,\" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement \"Made in the U. S. A.\"? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements. The U.S. Customs Service regulates country of origin marking (i.e., \"Made in the U.S.A.\") as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930. Their website is www.customs.ustreas.gov.\n* 13.How do I obtain a UPC bar code? The UPC bar code may be obtained from the Uniform Code Council. Their website is www.uc-council.org. Click on the button that says \"I Need a UPC Bar Code.\"\n* 14.Must expiration dating be included on the label of dietary supplements? No. However, a firm may include this information if it is supported by valid data demonstrating that it is not false or misleading.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter I.

In Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, Or Holding Operations For Dietary Supplements (72 FR 34752). The Dietary Supplement (DS) CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 111 (\"the DS CGMP rule\") requires persons who manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement to establish and follow current good manufacturing practice to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and to ensure that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record.\n\nThe Federal Register (72 FR 34959), FDA also issued an interim final rule (the identity testing interim final rule) setting forth a procedure for requesting an exemption from a requirement of the DS CGMP rule for the manufacturer to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any dietary ingredient that is a component of a dietary supplement. The provisions of the identity testing interim final rule have the full force of law, but FDA provided a 90-day comment period on those provisions through September 24, 2007. On September 17, 2007, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to extend the comment period to October 24, 2007.\n\nThe DS CGMP rule and the identity testing interim final rule were effective as of August 24, 2007. The compliance dates are described below.\n\nFDA has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in the DS CGMP rule 1111. The DS CGMP rule is binding and has the full force and effect of law.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\nIII. Subpart A - General Provisions\n\nCoverage of the DS CGMP Rule\n\nWho is subject to the DS CGMP rule?\n\nYou are subject to the DS CGMP rule if you manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement.\n\n(21 CFR 111.1(a))\n\nIn our answers to questions in sections III.A, III.B, III.C and XIX of this document, we address some specific examples of firms who do, or do not, fall within the coverage of the DS CGMP rule.\n2. Am I subject to the DS CGMP rule if I am a foreign firm?\n\nYes. The DS CGMP rule applies to you if you manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement imported or offered for import in any State or Territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(21 CFR 111.1(a)(2))\n3. Am I subject to the DS CGMP rule if my product is sold only within my state?\n\nYou may be subject to the DS CGMP rule for products sold only within your state. FDA may consider its jurisdiction over such products under the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or both, depending on the circumstances of the situation.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34785)\n4. Am I subject to the holding requirements established in the DS CGMP rule if I am a retailer who is holding dietary supplements at a retail establishment for the sole purpose of direct retail sale to individual consumers?\n\n(\\blacktriangle)\n\nTop 0\n\nCoverage of the DS CGMP Rule\n\nWho is subject to the DS CGMP rule?\n\nYou are subject to the DS CGMP rule if you manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement.\n\n(21 CFR 111.1(a))\n\nIn our answers to questions in sections III.A, III.B, III.C and XIX of this document, we address some specific examples of firms who do, or do not, fall within the coverage of the DS CGMP rule.\n2. Am I subject to the DS CGMP rule if I am a foreign firm?\n\nYes. The DS CGMP rule applies to you if you manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement imported or offered for import in any State or Territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(21 CFR 111.1(a)(2))\n3. Am I subject to the DS CGMP rule if my product is sold only within my state?\n\nYou may be subject to the DS CGMP rule for products sold only within your state. FDA may consider its jurisdiction over such products under the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or both, depending on the circumstances of the situation.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34785)\n4. Am I subject to the holding requirements established in the DS CGMP rule if I am a retailer who is holding dietary supplements at a retail establishment for the sole purpose of direct retail sale to individual consumers?\n\n(\\blacktriangle)\n\nTop 0No. Importantly, a retail establishment does not include a warehouse or other storage facility for a retailer or a warehouse or other storage facility that sells directly to individual consumers.\n\n(21 CFR 111.1(b); 72 FR 34792)\n5. Am I subject to the holding requirements established in the DS CGMP rule if I am a retailer who operates a warehouse or storage facility?\n\nYes. The \"retail exemption\" does not apply to you, because a retail establishment does not include a warehouse or other storage facility for a retailer or a warehouse or other storage facility that sells directly to individual consumers (21 CFR 111.1(b); 72 FR 34752 at 34792).\n6. Do the requirements of the DS CGMP rule apply to all types of dietary supplements (e.g., for botanical dietary supplements and for vitamin/mineral dietary supplements)?\n\nYes.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34913)\n\nB. How the DS CGMP Rule Applies to Specific Types of Operations\n\nAm I subject to the DS CGMP rule if I package, label, or distribute a dietary supplement manufactured by another firm?\n\nYes. The DS CGMP rule requires you to comply with those provisions directly applicable to the operations you perform.\n\nFor example, if you are a labeler, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nRequires you to comply with the requirement in 21 CFR 111.255 to establish a batch production record;\n\nRequires you to comply with other applicable requirements, such as requirements for personnel, physical plant and grounds, equipment and utensils, and holding operations;\n\nDoes not require you to comply with the requirement of 21 CFR 111.260(e) to include the identity and weight or measure of each component used, because you would be starting from packages that already had been filled rather than from individual components.\n\nAs another example, if you are a distributor who purchases a packaged and labeled dietary supplement and then holds the product in a warehouse for distribution to another physical location, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nRequires you to comply with requirements for holding and distributing; and\n\nRequires you to comply with other applicable requirements, such as requirements for personnel, the physical plant and grounds.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34793)\n9. How does FDA expect to apply the DS CGMP rule to practitioners?\n\nFDA expects to exercise enforcement discretion, on a case-by-case basis, in determining whether to apply the DS CGMP rule to practitioners such as herbalists, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and other related health care providers. For example:\n\nWe expect to exercise discretion in the case of a one-on-one consultation by a practitioner who is adequately trained in his or her profession. We believe such a case may not necessitate the same types of controls as we established in the DS CGMP rule for manufacturing activities on a larger scale. Such a practitioner may make some formulations in advance of the consultation and still make the formulations in very limited quantities for the individual client.\n\nWe are not considering exercising our enforcement discretion with respect to practitioners who prepare batches of dietary supplements and sell them to individual consumers without determining whether the dietary supplement is appropriate for each consumer's needs in a one-on-one personal consultation.\n\nWe are not considering exercising our enforcement discretion with respect to practitioners who prepare batches of a dietary supplement for which there is a known or suspected safety concern.\n\nWe do not expect the number of practitioners subject to the consideration of our enforcement discretion to be very large. Many products manufactured by practitioners would not necessarily be considered to be dietary supplements (e.g., certain products used by traditional Asian medicine practitioners).\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34793)\n\nC. How the DS CGMP Rule Applies to Contractors\n\n1. Does the DS CGMP rule apply to a contractor who provides a service to a firm who is subject to the DS CGMP rule?\n\nYes. Contractors who provide a particular service (such as packaging, labeling or both packaging and labeling) to a firm who is subject to the DS CGMP rule must comply with those regulations directly applicable to the operations they perform for the firm who contracted with them (72 FR 34752 at 34790). For example, if a contractor is a labeler, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nD. Terms Used in the DS CGMP Rule and In This Document\n\n1. What terms does the DS CGMP rule define?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule defines the following terms:\n\nActual yield;\n\nBatch;\n\nBatch number, lot number, or control number;\n\nComponent;\n\nContact surface;\n\nIngredient;\n\nIn-process material;\n\nLot;\n\nMicroorganisms;\n\nPest;\n\nPhysical plant;\n\nProduct complaint;\n\nQuality;\n\nQuality control;\n\nQuality control personnel;\n\nRepresentative sample;\n\nReprocessing;\n\nReserve sample;\n\nSanitize;\n\nTheoretical yield; and\n\nWater activity.\n\nThe DS CGMP rule also explains how we use the following terms:\n\nMust;\n\nWe; and\n\nYou.\n\nE. Other Applicable Statutory Provisions and Regulations\n\n1. Do other statutory provisions and regulations apply to persons who manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplements? Yes. You must comply with other applicable statutory provisions and regulations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to dietary supplements. (21 CFR 111.5)\n2. How does the DS CGMP rule relate to the food CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 110?

Also, provide the telephone number, FAX number, and e-mail address.\n\nType of Firm: Place a check mark or \"x\" on each line that applies to your firm. For example, if your firm manufactures all products that it sells, place a check mark after \"Manufacturer.\"\n\n12-Month Time Period for which Firm is Claiming an Exemption: Enter the specific time period for which you are requesting an exemption for your products. The time period for which you are claiming an exemption must be current with the date that you are submitting your notice. The exemption notice should apply to the current year.\n\nFor products for which a notice has been filed for the previous year, update the previous dates for the same dates of the upcoming year. For new products, the time period should start with the date on which sales in the United States are expected to begin: e.g., \"FROM\n\n10/01/04 -9/30/05.\"\n\nAverage Number of Full-Time Equivalent Employees for Twelve-Month Period: Enter the average number of full-time equivalent employees for your firm and all of its affiliates for the year preceding the 12-month period for which an exemption is claimed in item 4 (Refer to the sample small business exemption notice). For a new business, enter the number of employees for the upcoming year. The average number should include all employees for your firm and its affiliates, including the owner(s); officers; and all other personnel such as secretarial, production, and distribution. Firms are affiliates of each other when (either directly or indirectly) (1) one firm has the power to control the other, (2) a third party controls or has the power to control both, or (3) an identity of interest exists such that affiliation may be found.\n\nThe average number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by the following formula: Total number of hours of salary or wages paid to the employees of the firm and its affiliates divided by 2080 hours. For example, 254,998 paid hours divided by 2080 = 122. If the total number of actual employees for your firm and its affiliates is less than 100, you may enter the total number of actual employees instead of calculating the average number of full-time employees. For example, if a firm has 24 employees that work full-time, and 12 employees that work part-time, you may report 36 total actual employees instead of calculating the average number of full-time equivalent employees.\n\nReport of Units Sold (Continuation sheets using the same format for item 6 in the sample small business notice may be used if necessary):\n\nProduct:Under the column for product, enter the name, including the brand name, for each product for which your firm is claiming an exemption. A product includes all package sizes that are manufactured by a single manufacturer or which bears the same brand name, which has the same statement of identity, and has a similar preparation method. In considering whether products have similar preparation methods, consider all steps that go into the preparation of the products, from the initial formulation steps to any finishing steps; for example, products with different ingredients would be considered different food products and counted separately in determining the number of units.\n\nNo. of Units: Provide the approximate total number of units of the various package sizes of the product sold in the United States in the 12-month period preceding that for which the nutrition labeling exemption is claimed. For a new product, provide an estimate of the number of units of the product expected to be sold in the United States in the 12-month period for which you are claiming an exemption.\n\nThe approximate total number of units is the sum of the number of units of the various package sizes of the food product in the form in which it is sold to consumer. For example, the total of all 2-pound, 5-pound and 10-pound bags of flour should be provided as the total number of units of flour sold by a firm in the United States.\n\nThere may also be occasions when a food is sold in bulk or by individual pieces rather than in packaging. For example, flour may be sold in bulk displays at grocery stores. In this case, the number of units should be determined on the basis of the typical sales practice for the product. For instance, if 2000 pounds of flour are sold from bulk displays at grocery stores, and the typical practice for sales to consumers is to price the flour on a per bound basis, then the bulk sales would represent 2000 units. If this product is also sold in packaged form, then 2000 units should be added to the total number of units of flour sold by the firm in the United States.\n\nManufacturer: Under the column designated \"Manufacturer,\" enter the letter that corresponds with the name of the manufacturer of the product. The letter \"A\" is used to designate the firm submitting the notice if it is the manufacturer of the product.\n\nName and Address of Manufacturer(s), Distributor(s), or Importer(s) of Products in Item 6 (please refer to the sample small business exemption notice) if Different From Firm Claiming the Exemption: If the firm submitting the notice is not the manufacturer of the product, use the letter from item 7 (please refer to sample small business exemption notice) (B or C or additional letters may be used on a continuation sheet) that corresponds to the name and address of the manufacturer, distributor, or importer of the products for which an exemption is being claimed if they are different than the firm claiming the exemption. If the name of the manufacturer is unknown, provide the name of the firm (\\bigstar) from which the product is purchased. Top 0\n\nContact person: Enter the name of a person that can act as a contact for the firm if any questions arise concerning the information included in the notice.\n\nCertification: The form is to be signed by a responsible individual for the firm that can certify that the information provided in the notice is complete and accurate. The individual signing the notice will commit to notifying the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements when the average number of full-time equivalent employees or total number of units of products sold in the United States by the firm exceed the applicable numbers for the time period for which the exemption is being claimed.\n\nWeb-based Submission\n\n(https://www.cfsanappseexternal.fda.gov/scripts/NLE/client/login.cfm).\n\nHard Copy Model Form (/food/labeling-nutrition/small-business-nutrition-labeling-exemption-notice-model-form).\n\nThis document was issued on October 1, 2004, and updated on May 7, 2007.\n\nSee more recent information on Food Labeling (/labeling-nutrition-o).\n\nRelated Information\n\nLabeling & Nutrition Guidance Documents & Regulatory Information (/food/guidance-documents-regulatory-information-topic-food-and-dietary-supplements/labeling-nutrition-guidance-documents-regulatory-information).\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Petitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Business Nutrition Labeling Exemption Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.1230266094207764", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 17: For purposes of the dietary supplement labeling requirements, a \u201cdisease\u2019 is damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition\u201d (21 CFR 101.93(g)(1)).\n\n.4.3 Conventional Food\n\nSection 201(f) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines a food as \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" For studies intended to evaluate the effects of a food, the analysis for whether an IND is needed turns on the intent of the clinical investigation.\n\nAs is the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is \"intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,\"18 except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug (see section VI.4.3). Therefore, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a foodon a disease would require an IND under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease would require an IND.\n\nThe following paragraph in brackets [ ] is STAYED.\n\n[The FD&C Act also defines drug to include \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\"19 This provision contains a parenthetical exception for foods that affect the structure and function of the body by virtue of providing nutrition to sustain life and health. Consistent with case law interpreting the other than food, exception as applying to articles consumed primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value, FDA regulates conventional foods (including infant formula) that are intended to affect the structure or function of the body as foods, not drugs, as long as the intended structure or function effect derives from the product's character as a food -- its taste, aroma, or nutritive value.20 However, if an edible product that might otherwise be a conventional food is intended for a use other than providing taste, aroma, or nutritive value, such as blocking the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, the product becomes a drug because the primary purpose of consuming it has changed. In other words, the product is no longer being consumed as a food -- primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value -- but used as a drug for some other physiological effect. Accordingly, a clinical investigation intended only to evaluate the nutritional effects of a food (including medical foods21) would not require an IND, but an investigation intended to evaluate other effects of a food on the structure or function of the body would. For example, a study of the effect of iron on hemoglobin levels in which subjects were fed beef or lambas a source of iron would not require an IND, but a study of the effect of soy isoflav on bone metabolism would. Similarly, a study of the ability of an infant formula to support growth of infants or of other nutritional properties of the formula would not require an IND. However, a study of other effects of the formula on the structure or function of the body (e.g., an investigation of the effects of docosahexaenoic action in infant formula on visual acuity of infants) would require an IND.\n\nFootnote 19: 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C).\n\nFootnote 20: See Nutrilab v. Schweiker, 713 F.2d 335 (7th Cir. 1983).\n\nFootnote 21: A medical food is \u201ca food which is formulated to be consumed or administered generally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.\u201d 21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3).\n\nA clinical study intended to evaluate the safety of a food ingredient generally does not require an IND, even if the ingredient is known to have an effect on the structure and function of the body that is in addition to its taste, aroma, or nutritional effect. For example, a study of the safety of a flavor ingredient that has been found to bind to a receptor outside of the target location in the mouth would not require an IND if the intent of the study was to evaluate the safety of the ingredient when ingested as food. The following sentence in brackets [ ] is STAYED. [In contrast, if the intent of the study was to evaluate the beneficial effects (beyond nutritional effects) of binding the newly found receptor, the study would require an IND.] Similarly, a clinical study may be performed to evaluate the tolerability of a food in a specific susceptible population, including individuals with a disease. In such an evaluation, biological parameters affected by the disease may need to be assessed in order to establish tolerance. For example, the administration of high intensity sweeteners to diabetic patients to establish no adverse effect on HbA1c levels or the administration of a novel food protein ingredient to a potentially allergic population to establish lack of allergic reactivity in this population would not require an IND. However, if the intent of the study was to demonstrate an effect of the food in decreasing HbA1c levels in diabetic patients or an effect of the food to desensitize or raise threshold levels of allergic reactivity in sensitive individuals, the study would require an IND.\n\nConsistent with the considerations for conventional foods described in the previous paragraph, an investigation intended to evaluate the effects of a medical food on a disease would require an IND. However, if the medical food is simply being fed to subjects for nutritional purposes during a study examining the effects of another intervention, the use of the medical food in the study would not trigger the need for an IND, although the study might require an IND or investigational device exemption (IDE) for the intervention being studied.\n\niv.2.3 Studies Intended to Support a Health Claim\n\nNOTE: The stay does not apply to clinical investigations intended to evaluate whether a food substance may reduce the risk of a disease in individuals less than 12 months of age, those with altered immune systems, and those with serious or life-threatening medical conditions. This subsection is in effect for such clinical investigations.\n\nThe following paragraph in brackets [] is STAYED, except as noted above.\n\n[Section 201(g) of the FD&C Act provides that a health claim in the label or labeling of a food (conventional food or dietary supplement) characterizing the relationship between a substance (food or food component) and a disease or health-related condition does not cause the food to be a drug on the basis of that claim, provided the claim is authorized under and made in accordance with the requirements of section 403(r(1)R) and (r(3)S) of the FD&C Act [22] (for conventional foods) or under section 403(r)(1)B and (r(3)D)-(for dietary supplements). Notwithstanding this provision, however, a clinical study designed to evaluate the relationship between a food substance and a disease and intended to provide support for such a claim is required to be conducted under an IND (21 CFR part 312), unless the substance disgate relationship being studied is already the subject of an authorized health claim. Section 403 provides, in effect, an exemption from the normal operation of the drug definition [14] it permits the use of health claims that would, without the exemption caused in conventional food or dietary supplement to be a drug. However the exemption does not apply until the health claim has been authorized by FDA. Therefore a study conducted to support a new or expanded health claim would require an IND. For example, a study designed to evaluate whether vitamin D may reduce the risk of one or more site-specific cancers would require an IND, as there is currently no authorized health claim for this substance-disease relationship. Similarly, a study conducted to support a petition to amend the health claim for soluble fiber from certain foods and reduced risk of coronary heart disease (21 CFR 101.81) to include a new type of fiber would require an IND.]\n\nResearch With Noncommercial Intent\n\nSome believe that the IND regulations do not apply to clinical investigations that are not intended to investigate a drug's potential for commercial sale. Whether the IND regulations apply to a planned clinical investigation does not depend on whether the intent of the clinical investigation is commercial or noncommercial. Therefore, these types of studies would require an IND under part 312, unless they meet the criteria for an exemption in SSSS 312.2(b) or 320.31(b) (see section IV) or the criteria in SS 361.1, or the compound used is labeled with a cold isotope and used in the manner described in section V.\n\nVII Frequently asked questions\n\n1 Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?\n\nIf you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an unlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However, if you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the drug's ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.7119762897491455", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: Written instructions, including the following:\n\nSpecifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.210(h)(1));\n\nProcedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations (21 CFR 111.210(h)(2));\n\nSpecific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.210(h)(3));\n\nSuch specific actions must include verifying the weight or measure of any component and verifying the addition of any component (21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(i)); and\n\nFor manual operations, such specific actions must include one person weighing or measuring a component and another person verifying the weight or measure, and one person adding the component and another person verifying the addition (21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii));\n\nSpecial notations and precautions to be followed (21 CFR 111.210(h)(4)); and\n\nCorrective action plans for use when a specification is not met (21 CFR 111.210(h)(5)).\n\nXIII.

Subpart K - Production and Process Control System: Requirements for Manufacturing Operations\n\n1. How does the DS CGMP rule require me to design or select manufacturing processes?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires you to design or select manufacturing processes to ensure that product specifications are consistently met.\n\n(21 CFR 111.355)\n\n2. How does the DS CGMP rule require me to conduct manufacturing operations?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires you to conduct all manufacturing operations in accordance with adequate sanitation principles.\n\n(21 CFR 111.360)\n\nWhat precautions does the DS CGMP rule require me to take to prevent contamination during manufacturing operations?\n\nTop 0The DS CGMP rule requires you to take all necessary precautions during the manufacture of a dietary supplement to prevent contamination of components or dietary supplements, including the following specific precautions:\n\nPerforming manufacturing operations under conditions and controls that protect against the potential for growth of microorganisms and the potential for contamination (21 CFR 111.365(a));\n\nWashing or cleaning components that contain soil or other contaminants (21 CFR 111.365(b));\n\nUsing water that, at a minimum, complies with the applicable Federal, State, and local requirements and does not contaminate the dietary supplement when the water may become a component of the finished batch of dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.365(c));\n\nPerforming chemical, microbiological, or other testing, as necessary to prevent the use of contaminated components (21 CFR 111.365(d));\n\nSterilizing, pasteurizing, freezing, refrigerating, controlling hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), controlling humidity, controlling water activity (aw), or using any other effective means to remove, destroy, or prevent the growth of microorganisms and prevent decomposition (21 CFR 111.365(e));\n\nHolding components and dietary supplements that can support the rapid growth of microorganisms of public health significance in a manner that prevents the components and dietary supplements from becoming adulterated (21 CFR 111.365(f));\n\nIdentifying and holding any components or dietary supplements, for which a material review and disposition decision is required, in a manner that protects components or dietary supplements that are not under a material review against contamination and mix-ups with those that are under a material review (21 CFR 111.365(g));\n\nPerforming mechanical manufacturing steps (such as cutting, sorting, inspecting, shredding, drying, grinding, blending, and sifting) by any effective means to protect the dietary supplements against contamination (21 CFR 111.365(h));\n\nUsing effective measures to protect against the inclusion of metal or other foreign material in components or dietary supplements (21 CFR 111.365(i));\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.900217056274414"], "As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where:\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified;\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established;\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API.\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process.\n\nProcess Validation Program\n\nThe number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified.\n\nCritical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation.\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to or better than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies.\n\nPeriodic Review of Validated Systems\n\nSystems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation.\n\nCleaning Validation\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4473763704299927", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturers should seek regulatory approval before implementing a conversion of an approved batch process to a CM process. Manufacturers can seek advice from the regulatory authority to gain clarification on the regulatory expectations and acceptability of their strategy and data package for the proposed changes (e.g., when potential changes in formulation are necessary to enable conversion to CM and the impact of these changes on product registration).\n\nProcess Validation\n\nThe requirements for process validation as established by region are similar for CM and batch manufacturing processes. Approaches such as traditional process validation that uses a fixed number of validation batches or continuous process verification can be used.\n\nWhen continuous process verification is used, the CM system performance and output material quality is continuously monitored, such that the real-time data collected demonstrate the maintenance of a state of control and production of output material with the desired quality for the run time duration. The use of continuous process verification should be justified based on the product and process understanding, system design, and overall control strategy. This justification should be provided in the dossier (see Table 1 below).\n\nWhen a continuous process verification approach is used to support initial product launch, applicants should justify the appropriateness of the validation activities to provide confidence in the commercial manufacturing process.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System\n\nPQS expectations are the same for batch and CM processes and should follow pertinent ICH guidelines. One important operational aspect of CM is that non-conforming materials can be diverted from the rest of the batch when material traceability, process monitoring, and material diversion strategies are well established. Procedures for material diversion, when required, should be established under the PQS (see Section 4.2). An overarching plan or decision tree that describes how disturbances are managed for various types of material diversion should be maintained under the PQS. Diverted materials resulting from planned events (e.g., system start-up and shutdown) generally do not require investigation when the events meet established process performance criteria. Examples of approaches for managing disturbances are provided in Annex V. As described therein, when unexpected and/or frequent disturbances occur, appropriate investigation, root cause analysis, and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) should be instituted.\n\nLifecycle Management\n\nThe principles and approaches described in ICH Q12 are applicable to the lifecycle management of CM.\n\nSubmission of CM-Specific Information in the CTD\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.159520626068115", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: To determine the extent of validation, e.g.,\n\nIdentification of critical performance parameters\n\nSelection of the requirements and design\n\nCode review\n\nThe extent of testing and test methods\n\nReliability of electronic records and signaturesQuality Risk Management as Part of Materials Management Assessment and Evaluation of Suppliers and Contract Manufacturers (II.5)\n\nTo provide a comprehensive evaluation of suppliers and contract manufacturers (e.g., auditing, supplier quality agreements).\n\nStarting Material\n\nTo assess differences and possible quality risks associated with variability in starting materials (e.g., age, route of synthesis).\n\nUse of Materials\n\nTo determine whether it is appropriate to use material under quarantine (e.g., for further internal processing);\n\nTo determine appropriateness of reprocessing, reworking, use of returned goods.\n\nStorage, Logistics and Distribution Conditions\n\nTo assess the adequacy of arrangements to ensure maintenance of appropriate storage and transport conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, container design);\n\nTo determine the effect on product quality of discrepancies in storage or transport conditions (e.g., cold chain management) in conjunction with other ICH guidelines;\n\nTo maintain infrastructure (e.g., capacity to ensure proper shipping conditions, interim storage, handling of hazardous materials and controlled substances, customs clearance);\n\nTo provide information for ensuring the availability of pharmaceuticals (e.g., ranking risks to the supply chain).\n\nQuality Risk Management as Part of Production Validation (II.6)\n\nTo identify the scope and extent of verification, qualification, and validation activities (e.g., analytical methods, processes, equipment, and cleaning methods);\n\nTo determine the extent for follow-up activities (e.g., sampling, monitoring and re-validation);\n\nTo distinguish between critical and non-critical process steps to facilitate design of a validation study.\n\nIn-Process Sampling and Testing\n\nTo evaluate the frequency and extent of in-process control testing (e.g., to justify reduced testing under conditions of proven control);\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTo evaluate and justify the use of process analytical technologies (PAT) in conjunction with parametric and real time release.\n\n4.2.3 Production Planning\n\nTo determine appropriate production planning (e.g., dedicated, campaign and concurrent production process sequences).\n\nG.

Understanding hazards to quality/manufacturing is critical to maintaining supply predictability. When risks are well understood and controlled, a higher confidence in product availability can be attained.\n\n4.2.7 Manufacturing Process Variation and State of Control\n\nTo decrease variability in the manufacturing process (e.g., process drift, non-uniformity) and associated capability gaps that can result in unpredictable outputs, adversely impact quality and consequently timeliness, yield and product availability;Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTo design monitoring systems that are capable of detecting departures from a state of control and deficiencies in manufacturing processes, so they can be appropriately investigated to determine root causes and any required risk mitigations.\n\nManufacturing Facilities and Equipment\n\nTo ensure that facility infrastructure and equipment are suitable and designed for robust manufacturing (this includes packaging and testing) (see Anne II.4);\n\nTo establish facility and equipment maintenance programs that assure reliable facility and equipment performance;\n\nTo ensure that the operational design of equipment is not vulnerable to human error;\n\nTo obtain quality and efficiency gains through the utilization of digitalization, automation, isolation technology, and other innovations.\n\nSupplier Oversight and Relationships\n\nTo enhance review and monitoring activities (see section III.G (2.7) of ICH Q10) when substantial variability is identified in the quality and safety of supplied materials or in the services provided.\n\nTo manage external product availability risks relating to quality/manufacturing, (e.g., from raw material suppliers, contracted organizations, service providers, etc.).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q9(R1) Quality Risk Management \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.306972026824951", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 3: See guidance for industry and FDA staff, General Principles of Software Validation.\n\nd. Continuous Improvement and Knowledge Management\n\nContinuous learning through data collection and analysis over the life cycle of a product is important. These data can contribute to justifying proposals for postapproval changes. Approaches and information technology systems that support knowledge acquisition from such databases are valuable for the manufacturers and can also facilitate scientific communication with the Agency.\n\nOpportunities need to be identified to improve the usefulness of available relevant product and process knowledge during regulatory decision making. A knowledge base can be of most benefit when it consists of scientific understanding of the relevant multi-factorial relationships (e.g., between formulation, process, and quality attributes) as well as a means to evaluate the applicability of this knowledge in different scenarios (i.e., generalization). Today's information technology infrastructure makes the development and maintenance of this knowledge base practical.\n\niv.1.2 Risk-Based Approach\n\nWithin an established quality system and for a particular manufacturing process, one would expect an inverse relationship between the level of process understanding and the risk of producing a poor quality product. For processes that are well understood, opportunities exist to develop less restrictive regulatory approaches to manage change (e.g., no need for a regulatory submission). Thus, a focus on process understanding can facilitate risk-based regulatory decisions and innovation. Note that risk analysis and management is broader than what is discussed within the PAT framework and may form a system of its own.\n\n3.1.3 Integrated Systems Approach\n\nThe fast pace of innovation in today's information age necessitates integrated systems thinking for evaluating and timely application of efficient tools and systems that satisfy the needs of patients and the industry. Many of the advances that have occurred, and are anticipated to occur, are bringing the development, manufacturing, quality assurance, and information/knowledge management functions so closely together that these four areas should be coordinated in an integrated manner. Therefore, upper management support for these initiatives is critical for successful implementation.\n\nThe Agency recognizes the importance of having an integrated systems approach to the regulation of PAT. Therefore, the Agency developed a new regulatory strategy that includes a PAT team approach to joint training, certification, CMC review, and CGMP inspections.\n\n3.1.4 Real Time Release\n\nReal time release is the ability to evaluate and ensure the acceptable quality of in-process and/or final product based on process data. Typically, the PAT component of real time release includes a valid combination of assessed material attributes and process controls. Material attributes can be assessed using direct and/or indirect process analytical methods. The combined process measurements and other test data gathered during the manufacturing process can serve as the basis for real time release of the final product and would demonstrate that each batch conforms to established regulatory quality attributes. We consider real time release to be comparable to alternative analytical procedures for final product release.\n\nReal time release as defined in this guidance builds on parametric release for heat terminally sterilized drug products, a practice in the United States since 1985. In real time release, material attributes as well as process parameters are measured and controlled.\n\nThe Agency's approval should be obtained prior to implementing real time release for products that are the subject of market applications or licenses. Process understanding, control strategies, plus on-, in-, or at-line measurement of critical attributes that relate to product quality provides a scientific risk-based approach to justify how real time quality assurance is at least equivalent to, or better than, laboratory-based testing on collected samples. Real time release as defined in this guidance meets the requirements of testing and release for distribution (21 CFR 211.165).\n\nWith real time quality assurance, the desired quality attributes are ensured through continuous assessment during manufacture. Data from production batches can serve to validate the process and reflect the total system design concept, essentially supporting validation with each manufacturing batch.\n\nStrategy for Implementation\n\nThe Agency understands that to enable successful implementation of PAT, flexibility, coordination, and communication with manufacturers is critical. The Agency believes thatcurrent regulations are sufficiently broad to accommodate these strategies. Regulations can effectively support innovation when clear, effective, and meaningful communication exists between the Agency and industry, for example, in the form of meetings or informal communications.\n\nThe first component of the PAT framework described above addresses many of the uncertainties with respect to innovation and outlines broad principles for addressing anticipated scientific and technical issues. This framework should assist a manufacturer in proposing and adopting innovative manufacturing and quality assurance. The Agency encourages such proposals and has developed a regulatory strategy to consider such proposals. The Agency's regulatory strategy includes the following:\n\nA PAT team approach for CMC review and CGMP inspections\n\nJoint training and certification of PAT review, inspection and compliance staff\n\nScientific and technical support for the PAT review, inspection and compliance staff\n\nThe recommendations provided in this guidance\n\nIdeally, PAT principles and tools should be introduced during the development phase. The advantage of using these principles and tools during development is to create opportunities to improve the mechanistic basis for establishing regulatory specifications. Manufacturers are encouraged to use the PAT framework to develop and discuss approaches for establishing mechanistic-based regulatory specifications for their products. The recommendations provided in this guidance are intended to alleviate concerns with approval or inspection when adopting the PAT framework.\n\nIn the course of implementing the PAT framework, manufacturers may want to evaluate the suitability of a PAT tool on experimental and/or production equipment and processes. For example, when evaluating experimental on- or in-line process analyzers during production, it is recommended that risk analysis of the impact on product quality be conducted before installation. This can be accomplished within the facility's quality system without prior notification to the Agency. Data collected using an experimental tool should be considered research data. If research is conducted in a production facility, it should be under the facility's own quality system.\n\nWhen using new measurement tools, such as on- or in-line process analyzers, certain data trends, intrinsic to a currently acceptable process, may be observed. Manufacturers should scientifically evaluate these data to determine how or if such trends affect quality and implementation of PAT tools. FDA does not intend to inspect research data collected on an existing product for the purpose of evaluating the suitability of an experimental process analyzer or other PAT tool. FDA's routine inspection of a firm's manufacturing process that incorporates a PAT tool for research purposes will be based on current regulatory standards (e.g., test results from currently approved or acceptable regulatory methods). Any FDA decision to inspect research data would be based on exceptional situations similar to those outlined in Compliance Policy Guide Sec.\n\n130.300.4 Those data used to support validation or regulatory submissions will be subject to inspection in the usual manner.\n\nFootnote 4: FDA/ORA Compliance Policy Guide, Sec. 130.300, FDA Access to Results of Quality Assurance Program Audits and Inspections (CPG 7151.02).\n\nV Pat Regulatory Approach\n\nOne goal of this guidance is to tailor the Agency's usual regulatory scrutiny to meet the needs of PAT-based innovations that (1) improve the scientific basis for establishing regulatory specifications, (2) promote continuous improvement, and (3) improve manufacturing while maintaining or improving the current level of product quality. To be able to do this, manufacturers should communicate relevant scientific knowledge to the Agency and resolve related technical issues in a timely manner. Our goal is to facilitate a consistent scientific regulatory assessment involving multiple Agency offices with varied responsibilities.\n\nThis guidance provides a broad perspective on our proposed PAT regulatory approach. Close communication between the manufacturer and the Agency's PAT review and inspection staff will be a key component in this approach. We anticipate that communication between manufacturers and the Agency may continue over the life cycle of a product and that communication will be in the form of meetings, telephone conferences, and written correspondence.\n\nWe have posted much of the information you will need on our PAT Web page located at http://www.fda.gov/cder/OPS/PAT.htm. Please refer to the Web page to keep breast of important information. We recommend general correspondence related to PAT be directed to the FDA PAT Team. Manufacturers can contact the PAT Team regarding any PAT questions at: PAT@cder.fda.gov. Address any written correspondence to the address provided on the PAT Web page. All written correspondence should be identified clearly as PROCESS ANALYTICAL TECHOLOGY or PAT.\n--------------------\nContext title: PAT \u2014 A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.04537296295166", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: identification of critical performance parameters;\n\nselection of the requirements and design;\n\ncode review;\n\nthe extent of testing and test methods;\n\nreliability of electronic records and signatures.\n\nII.5 Quality Risk Management as Part of Materials Management\n\nAssessment and evaluation of suppliers and contract manufacturers\n\nTo provide a comprehensive evaluation of suppliers and contract manufacturers (e.g., auditing, supplier quality agreements).\n\nStarting material\n\nTo assess differences and possible quality risks associated with variability in starting materials (e.g., age, route of synthesis).\n\nUse of materials\n\nTo determine whether it is appropriate to use material under quarantine (e.g., for further internal processing);\n\nTo determine appropriateness of reprocessing, reworking, use of returned goods.\n\nStorage, logistics and distribution conditions\n\nTo assess the adequacy of arrangements to ensure maintenance of appropriate storage and transport conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, container design);\n\nTo determine the effect on product quality of discrepancies in storage or transport conditions (e.g., cold chain management) in conjunction with other ICH guidelines;\n\nTo maintain infrastructure (e.g., capacity to ensure proper shipping conditions, interim storage, handling of hazardous materials and controlled substances, customs clearance);\n\nTo provide information for ensuring the availability of pharmaceuticals (e.g., ranking risks to the supply chain).\n\nII.6 Quality Risk Management as Part of Production\n\nValidation\n\nTo identify the scope and extent of verification, qualification and validation activities (e.g., analytical methods, processes, equipment and cleaning methods);\n\nTo determine the extent for follow-up activities (e.g., sampling, monitoring and re-validation);\n\nTo distinguish between critical and non-critical process steps to facilitate design of a validation study.\n\nIn-process sampling & testing\n\nTo evaluate the frequency and extent of in-process control testing (e.g., to justify reduced testing under conditions of proven control);\n\nTo evaluate and justify the use of process analytical technologies (PAT) in conjunction with parametric and real time release.\n\nProduction planning\n\nTo determine appropriate production planning (e.g., dedicated, campaign and concurrent production process sequences).\n\nII.7 Quality Risk Management as Part of Laboratory Control and Stability Studies\n\nOut of specification results\n\nTo identify potential root causes and corrective actions during the investigation of out of specification results.\n\nRetest period / expiration date\n\nTo evaluate adequacy of storage and testing of intermediates, excipients and starting materials.\n\nICH Q9(R1) Guideline\n\nII.8 Quality Risk Management as Part of Packaging and Labeling\n\nDesign of packages\n\nTo design the secondary package for the protection of primary packaged product (e.g., to ensure product authenticity, label legibility).\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q9(R1)_Guideline_Step4_2023_0126_0\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.427130222320557", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: an audit procedure to measure the degree of conformance and the effectiveness of the quality assurance program, including product audits;\n\nlifetime and reliability testing procedures or other suitable means to determine whether the product will continue to meet its design specifications during its useful life;\n\na continuous review of the product's performance throughout its useful life and a procedure to ensure that any problems discovered are corrected, and that appropriate design changes are made to eliminate them from subsequent units produced;\n\ndocumentation control to assure that all manufacturing, component, and finished product specifications adequately reflect the product design and provide an effective and consistent mechanism for changes of specifications or quality control procedures; and\n\nquality control records, including a device master record and a device history record.\n\nObjectivity of program\n\nThe quality assurance program should be carefully designed and administered to ensure the objectivity of the program. Certain safeguards against personal prejudice and conflicting interests should be built into the system to avoid biased decisions. This may present a problem in small manufacturing firms that employ only a few persons. However, the division of responsibility between production and quality control personnel should be maintained. This may be accomplished, for example, if one person, who is responsible for the receiving, inspection, and accountability of components, is also designed responsible for in-process checks and finished product inspection. Another person should be held responsible for all the production processes. This arrangement (or similar ones) may sustain the objectivity of the quality control program by dividing the responsibilities.\n\nDocumentation and records\n\nComplete documentation of the quality assurance program must be maintained as required by 21 CFR 1002.30. This should include such items as description of tests performed and their sequence, description of the measurement instrumentation and techniques, rejection criteria or confidence limits and justification for choosing such limits, methods of data analysis and sampling plans. If all the units produced are not tested, a sampling technique must be used and must be serupulously documented and followed. Standardized forms for data recording should be used. The forms should provide space for logging all information relevant.to the product and the test, including the product model and serial numbers, date of test, date of manufacture, samples per lot, results of test, identification of personnel performing and reviewing the test, and model and serial numbers of test instruments. A device master record as required by 21 CFR 820.181 must be established for each type of device and include, or refer to the location of, the information concerning:\n\nthe device specification, including drawings and component specifications;\n\nproduction process specifications, including the appropriate equipment specifications, production methods, and production procedures;\n\npackaging and labeling specifications; and\n\nquality assurance procedures and specifications, including quality assurance checks used and the quality assurance apparatus used. The device master record shall be prepared, dated, and signed by a designated individual(s).\n\nA device history record as required by 21 CFR 820.184 must also be maintained and it shall include, or refer to the location of, the information concerning the dates of manufacture, the quantity manufactured, the quantity released for distribution, and any control number used.\n\nAmong small manufacturers of sunlamp products, the manufacturing process may be limited to assembling components into the final product, and there should be no problem with communication and managing operations. In this situation, written manufacturing procedures may be reduced to a practical extent. In some cases, training and work experience may be considered valid substitutes for written manufacturing procedures. However, manufacturers must still ensure uniformity of procedures and keep records of test results necessary to ensure the quality of the product.\n\nRecords required by the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act are to be kept for 5 years (21 CFR 1002.31(a)), and for no less than 2 years if required by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetie Act (21 CFR 820.180(b)). Test records, complaints, trends analyses, failure analyses, and audits should be used to identify and provide solutions to quality assurance problems.\n\nValidity of Measurement\n\nA valid program of measurements made as part of quality assurance testing involves periodic evaluation of the test methods and calibration of the instruments. A schedule to recalibrate measuring instruments against an acceptable standard is important to ensure a consistent measurement capability. Calibration services from the instrument manufacturer or other qualified outside sources, with traceability to National Bureau of Standards primary measurement standards, should be used when adequate calibration facilities are not available within a company.\n\nThe instrumentation should be carefully specified and selected to ensure that it is capable of performing the tests required by the standard. For example, instruments for ultraviolet (UV) radiation measurements should have sufficient spectral sensitivity in the UV region to measure the anticipated radiation levels from the product. After the measurement instruments have been obtained, they need to be evaluated for proper performance and operation. Control charts and logs of instrument performance and calibrations are essential, as well as service and maintenance schedules. Any changes of the operator, or in the instrument, its components, its techniques of use, calibration standards, or other relevant components of the measurements system should be documented.\n\nAudit Procedures\n\nThe purpose of the quality audit is to check the degree of conformance of the quality control procedures and the effectiveness of the quality assurance program, and to ensure that all procedures established are adequate and consistently followed. The quality audits are in addition to the routine quality assurance program and should include, but not be limited to, product audits. A product audit is an independent evaluation of product quality to determine if the product complies with the standards and if the product conforms to design specifications. Random sampling is the only acceptable method in selecting units for product audit. The person responsible for the audit should not have responsibility for the matter being audited but must have sufficient training and experience in the manufacturing process and testing procedures. For small manufacturers, a simple checklist with appropriate instructions may suffice. Documentation of audits and their results must be kept; results of findings should be reviewed by management. Audit frequency should be consistent with findings, but the interval between audits should not exceed 1 year.\n\nPersonnel Training\n\nAll quality assurance and production personnel shall have the necessary training to perform their assigned responsibilities adequately. They should have a thorough understanding of their jobs and be made aware of defects and errors likely to be encountered in performing their assigned functions.\n\n2 Preproduction evaluation\n\nPreproduction evaluation and testing should include a review of the design, evaluation of components and material obtained from other manufacturers, and engineering and prototype testing to confirm that the product as designed can be manufactured in compliance with the standard and in conformance with the design specifications.\n\nDesign Review\n\nBefore the manufacture of the product begins, the product design must be reviewed to determine if the product will comply with the Federal performance standard and other applicable criteria for product safety, including electrical and mechanical safety.\n\nThis review allows the manufacturer to perform a step-by-step evaluation of the requirements for the product and the means used to fulfill these requirements. In addition to the performance requirements, the conditions and environments under which the product will be used should be considered carefully. For example, if a product is intended to be used at a commercial facility and an alternate timer such as a coin box is permitted, then a mechanism must be incorporated into the coin box to allow the user to terminate exposure before completion of the timer cycle and to prevent the timer from operating continuously in excess of the recommended maximum exposure time. The coin box timer must also provide intermediate exposure times compatible with the recommended schedule. The egggies should be evaluated to ensure adequate eye protection for the user under all possible exposure positions and uses. The location of controls, particularly the radiation emission control, should be convenient for the user to reach in case of emergency. The contents and locations of the required labels should be carefully reviewed to assure they comply with the standard and policies. The development of a recommended exposure schedule for the particular product design is of utmost importance and should be checked against the agency guidelines. In general, an adequate safety factor regarding the use of the product should be built into the product design, because the product is not only expected to be in compliance at the time of manufacture but also during its entire useful life (see Appendix B for details of compliance requirements).\n\nFurther, the manufacturing process must be reviewed to assure that the design basis for the product, components, and packaging is correctly translated into approved specifications.\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Control Guide for Sunlamp Products (FDA 88-8234)       March 1988\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.885679721832275"], "Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance Document\n\nGuidance for Industry: FDA's Implementation of Qualified Health Claims\n\nMAY 2006\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-fda-implementation-qualified-health-claims)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nComments and suggestions regarding this document may be submitted at any time.

As part of this initiative, the agency established interim procedures whereby \"qualified\" health claims can be made not only for dietary supplements but for conventional foods as well (see Interim\n\nProcedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food\n\nAn example of dietary guidance, which does not refer to a specific substance but rather refers to a broad class of foods without an expressed or implied connection to a specific substance that is present the class of foods is: \"Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer\". One element is present, but not both. It is not a health claim because it cannot reasonably be understood to be about a specific substance. A dietary guidance statement that refers to a specific food or food component but not a disease or health-related condition is: \"Carrots are good for your health, \" or \"Calcium is good for you.\" Again, one element is present, but not both.\n8. How is dietary guidance provided for on food labels? Truthful, non-misleading dietary guidance statements may be used on food labels, and do not undergo pre-review by FDA. However, once the food is marketed with the statement, FDA can consider whether the statement meets the requirement to be truthful and not misleading (see 21 CFR 101.14). FDA, as part of its recent Better Nutrition Information for Consumer Health Initiative, recognized that scientifically sound and non-misleading dietary guidance statements may be useful to consumers when placed on food labels.\n\nProcedures for Qualified Health Claims\n\nWhat are the regulatory procedures associated with qualified health claims? All health claims, whether SSA or qualified, require that a petition be submitted to FDA. The requirements for health claim petitions are specified in 21 CFR 101.70, and the general requirements for health claims are in 21 CFR 101.14. Both types of health claims can be applicable to conventional foods and dietary supplements, must characterize the substance's ability to reduce the risk of disease, and cannot be about mitigating or treating disease. Qualified health claims have differences that relate to scientific support, wording of the claim, use of enforcement discretion, and timelines.\n\nHow is the science supporting a qualified health claim different from that for an SSA health claim? SSA health claims require significant scientific agreement based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (see 21 CFR 101.14). Qualified health claims are still based on the totality of publicly available evidence but the scientific support does not have to be as strong as that for significant scientific agreement. Under its interim guidance (see Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04400072/044-0072-pdn0001-05-FDA-vol5.pdf)), FDA is tentatively providing for 3 levels of science below the SignificantScientific Agreement standard: good to moderate level of scientific agreement, low level of scientific agreement, and very low level of scientific agreement. The criteria for the scientific review are described in the interim guidance.\n\nHow the language for qualified health claims is different? Qualified health claims language must be worded (\"qualified\") in such a way that consumers are not misled about the nature of the supporting science. As part of its interim guidance (see Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04q0072/04q-0072-pdn0001-05-FDA-vol5.pdf)), FDA has specified qualifying language for the 3 levels of scientific support below the Significant Scientific Agreement standard. FDA also notes that it may consider other qualifying language on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHow do the regulatory procedures for qualified health claims differ from SSA health claims? Petitions requesting an SSA health claim are evaluated under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard (see Significant Scientific Agreement in the Review of Health Claims for Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements_ (http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/995424GD.pdf)). If FDA decides that standard is met, it authorizes the claim through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Petitions requesting a qualified health claim are posted on the FDA web page for a 60-day public comment period. Qualified health claims meeting the interim procedures criteria are provided for by letters of enforcement discretion (as described above). The letter of enforcement discretion will be posted on the FDA web page. Petitions for a qualified health claim that have no credible scientific evidence for the claim may be denied. These letters will be posted on FDA's website.\n\n*What is the procedural timeline for qualified health claims?\n\nWithin 15 days of receipt, FDA will acknowledge the petition.\n\nWithin 45 days of receipt, FDA will file the petition and a docket number will be assigned. Note: Petitions that do not meet content requirements as specified in 21 CFR 101.70 will not be filed and will be returned to the petitioner.\n\nAt the time of filing, FDA will post the petition on the FDA webpage for a 60-day public comment period. During this time, written comments may be submitted to the docket.\n\nOn or before 270 days after receipt of the petition, a final decision will be sent to the petitioner in the form of a letter as to whether FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to a qualified health claim or deny the petition. The letter will be posted on FDA's website.\n\nExtensions beyond 270 days can be granted upon mutual agreement between the petitioner and the agency.\n\nSubmitting a Petition\n\nHow will FDA know that I wish to have my petition reviewed under the standards for a qualified health claim rather than those for an SSA health claim (i.e., under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard)? The petitioner may indicate within the petition's cover letter that he/she is waiving the right to a review under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard and request that the petition be reviewed under the interim procedures for a qualified health claim. This request will result in FDA proceeding directly to the qualified health claim procedures and its 270-day timeline (see next question). In the absence of such a request, FDA contacts the petitioner to determine if they are petitioning for a SSA or qualified health claim.\n\nWhat information is required to be included in the petition? The requirements of 21 CFR 101.70 apply. A general summary of these requirements follows. 1. Preliminary Requirements (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)(A)) Explanation of how substance conforms to the requirements of CFR 101.14(b): * Relationship between substance and disease in U.S; * Substance contributes taste, aroma, nutritive value, or a technical effect listed in 21 CFR 170.3(0); * Substance is a food, food ingredient, or component that has been shown to be safe and lawful at levels necessary to justify a claim. 2. Summary of Scientific data (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)(B)) 3. Analytical data to show amount of substance that is present in representative foods (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)(C)) 4. Proposed model health claim(s) (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)(D)) 5. Attachments (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)(E)) * Scientific data supporting a claim: * Copies of computer literature searches; * Copy of all research articles relied upon for support of petition -- English only; * Information concerning adverse consequences pertinent to any segment of the US population. 6. A claim for categorical exclusion or an environmental assessment (see 21 CFR 101.70(f)(F)) NOTE: FDA encourages petitioners to specify whether they are requesting that their petition be reviewed as a qualified health claim, and that they waive review under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard.\n\nWhere should I send the petition?\n\nMail the original and one copy of the petition (or a computer readable disk containing the petition) to the following address:\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800)\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\nElectronic submissions may also be emailed to: label.claims@cfsan.fda.gov\n\nOther\n\nAre there circumstances when FDA will not file a petition?\n\nYes, if the petition is incomplete in that it does not provide the required information that is summarized above (#15).\n\nRelated Information\n\nLabeling & Nutrition Guidance Documents & Regulatory.Information (/food/guidance-\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Implementation of Qualified Health Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.9262619018554688", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance Document\n\nGuidance for Industry: Notification of a Health Claim or\n\nNutrient Content Claim Based on an Authoritative\n\nStatement of a Scientific Body\n\nJUNE 1998\n\nDocket Number:\n\nFDA-1998-D-0102 (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1998-D-0102).\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-notification-health-claim-or-\n\nnutrient-content-claim-based-authoritative-statement)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nOffice of Nutrition, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements\n\nNutrition Program Staff, HFS-83o\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-1450\n\nOMB Control No. 0910-0374\n\nExpiration Date: 04/30/2018\n\nSee additional PRA statements at the end of this guidance\n\nNote: This document was modified on February 10, 2009.

These provisions are intended to expedite the process by which the scientific basis for such claims is established. Since the passage of FDAMA, FDA has been reviewing both the statute and the accompanying legislative history in order to determine the most appropriate approach for implementing these new provisions. Due to the speed with which the FDAMA provisions became effective, the agency has decided to issue this guidance document during the initial phase of implementing these new provisions. Submission procedures and use of a public docket for claims Notifications should be submitted in duplicate to Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740 or by email at label.claims@cfsan.fda.gov (mailto:label.claims@cfsan.fda.gov). The notification should be clearly marked as \"Notification for a Health Claim (or Nutrient Content Claim) Based on an Authoritative Statement.\" Whether notifications will be placed in a public docket upon receipt will be addressed in notice and comment rulemaking for an implementing regulation. When a notification is received, FDA intends to review whether the notification includes the information necessary for the claim to be authorized under sections 303 and 304 of FDAMA. This may include, for example, a review for the submission of all the required elements and the identification of an appropriate statement from an appropriate scientific body (as identified below). The agency intends to notify the submitter by letter as soon as possible within the 120 days after submission when the notification does not comply with sections 303 and 304. When a notification does not meet the requirements of sections 303 and 304, the use of the claim is not authorized under FDAMA. The submitter may choose to revise the notification and resubmit it, in which case a food could not be marketed with the claim until at least 120 days after resubmission. As provided by FDAMA, FDA also may act to prohibit or modify a claim by regulation or a United States district court may find that the requirements of section 303 or 304 of FDAMA have not been met. Scientific body FDAMA permits claims based on current, published authoritative statements from \"a scientific body of the United States with official responsibility for public health protection or research directly related to human nutrition... or the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or any of its subdivisions.\" The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are federal government agencies specifically identified as scientific bodies by FDAMA. FDA believes that other federal agencies may also qualify as appropriate sources for such authoritative statements. Along with NAS (or any of its subdivisions), the agency currently considers that the following federal scientific bodies may be sources of authoritative statements: the CDC, the NIH, and the Surgeon General within Department of Health and Human Services; and the Food and Nutrition Service, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Agricultural Research Service within the Department of Agriculture.\n\nAuthoritative statement FDA also believes it is necessary to clarify what constitutes an authoritative statement under FDAMA. FDAMA itself states that an authoritative statement: (1) is \"about the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-related condition\" for a health claim, or \"identifies the nutrient level to which the claim refers\" for a nutrient content claim, (2) is \"published by the scientific body\" (as identified above), (3) is \"currently in effect,\" and (4) \"shall not include a statement of an employee of the scientific body made in the individual capacity of the employee.\"\n\nIn addition, given the legislative history of sections 303 and 304 of FDAMA, FDA currently believes authoritative statements also should: (5) reflect a consensus within the identified scientific body if published by a subdivision of one of the Federal scientific bodies, and (6) be based on a deliberative review by the scientific body of the scientific evidence.\n\nNot all pronouncements by the designated scientific bodies would meet these criteria. For example, authoritative statements by the Surgeon General would normally be found only in the Surgeon General Reports.\n\nFDA intends to consult, as appropriate, with the scientific body that is the source of a statement cited as the basis for a claim, as well as with the other federal scientific bodies that have public health responsibilities and expertise relative to the claim. The agency has already begun this liaison process.\n\nScientific standard with respect to health claims FDAMA upholds the \"significant scientific agreement\" standard for health claims. This conclusion is based on FDAMA and its legislative history. FDAMA provides that FDA may issue a regulation under section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the Act to prohibit or modify a claim. Section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) permits FDA to promulgate regulations authorizing health claims only if FDA \"determines, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.\"\n\nConsistent with this provision, FDA intends to determine whether the standard of significant scientific agreement is met by a health claim based on an authoritative statement. And consistent with earlier regulations, FDA does not believe this standard would allow for a claim based on, for example, findings characterized as preliminary results, statements that indicate research is inconclusive, or statements intended to guide future research.\n\nFDATA requires that a person must submit a notification of the claim at least 120 days before the first introduction into interstate commerce of the food with a label containing the claim. FDA notes that, as indicated by FDAMA, the notification is to include: (1) \"the exact words used in the claim,\" (2) \"a concise description of the basis upon which such person relied for determining that the requirements\" for an authoritative statement \"have been satisfied,\" (3) \"a copy of the statement referred to...upon which such person relied in making the claim,\" and (4) for a health claim, \"a balanced representation of the scientific literature relating to the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-related condition to which the claim refers,\" or, for a nutrient content claim, \"a balanced representation of the scientific literature relating to the nutrient level to which the claim refers.\"\n\nFDA expects that to provide a \"balanced representation of the scientific literature,\" a bibliography of the scientific literature on the topic of the claim would be compiled. A brief, balanced account or analysis of how this literature either supports or fails to support the authoritative statement should be submitted.\n\nFDAMA imposes several additional conditions on claims based on authoritative statements and the foods for which such claims are made. For example, FDAMA requires that such a claim be \"stated in a manner so that the claim is an accurate representation of the authoritative statement referred to\" and \"so that the claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided in the claim and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of a total daily diet.\"\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Notification of a Health Claim or Nutrient Content Claim Based on an Authoritative Statement of a Scientific Body \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.487669467926025", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter VI.

Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.459925174713135", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Regarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest 5 mg or mcg. The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, are folate and\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]\n\n2.2 Recommendations for declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels using RDIs for adults and children (\\geq) 4 years\n\nThis table provides recommendations for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals using only the RDIs that have been established for adults and children 4 years of age and older. Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), provide RDIs for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, and pregnant and lactating women. The declaration recommendations provided in this guidance can also be applied to the RDIs for these subpopulations.\n\nVII References\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,\" Advisory Report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA's regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as \"(b)(2)-dietary ingredients.\" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA's regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as \"the compliance requirements.\"\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA's Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.816626071929932", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFood Labeling: Nutrient Content Claims; Alpha-Linolenic Acid, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, and Docosahexaenoicenoic Acid Omega-3 Fatty Acids; Guidance for Industry Small Entity Compliance Guide\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling\n\nNutrition Programs Staff, HFS-830\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-1450\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 28, 2014 (79 FR 23262), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) issued a final rule entitled \"Food Labeling: Nutrient Content Claims; Alpha-Linolenic Acid, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, and Docosahexaenoicenoic Acid Omega-3 Fatty Acids\" (\"the rule\"). The rule prohibits certain nutrient content claims for foods, including conventional foods and dietary supplements, that contain omega-3 fatty acids based on our determination that such nutrient content claims do not meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).\n\nWe issued the rule in response to three notifications submitted to us. One notification concerning nutrient content claims for Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA), Docosahexaenoicenoic Acid (DHA), and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) was submitted collectively by Alaska General Seafoods, Ocean Beauty Seafoods, Inc., and Trans-Ocean Products, Inc. (the seafood processors notification); a second notification concerning nutrient content claims for ALA, DHA, and EPA was submitted by Martek Biosciences Corp. (the Martek notification); and a third notification concerning nutrient content claims for DHA and EPA was submitted by Ocean Nutrition Canada, Ltd. (the Ocean Nutrition notification). The rule prohibits the nutrient content claims for DHA and EPA set forth in the three notifications and the nutrient content claims for ALA set forth in the seafood processors notification. We did not take regulatory action with respect to the nutrient content claims for ALA set forth in the Martek notification and, therefore, these claims will be allowed to remain on the market (79 FR 23262).\n\nThis rule is effective November 1, 2016.\n\nWe have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in the rule, and is intended to assist small entities in complying with the rule (21 CFR 101.8). The rule is binding and has the full force and effect of law.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" refers to individuals and entities making nutrient content claims that are subject to the rule.\n\nII. Who is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou may be subject to the rule if you make a nutrient content claim for DHA and EPA, and certain nutrient content claims for ALA.\n\nA. What are \"Nutrient Content Claims?\"\n\n\"Nutrient content claims\" are labeling claims that characterize the level of a nutrient in a food (see section 403(r)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act).\n\nB. Where are Nutrient Content Claims subject to this rule defined?\n\nThe nutrient content claims subject to this rule are defined in SS 101.54. \"High\" is defined as 20 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or the Daily Reference Value (DRV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC) (SS 101.54(b)). \"Good source\" is defined as 10 to19 percent of the RDI or DRV per RACC (SS 101.54(c)). \"More\" is defined as at least 10 percent more of the RDI or DRV per RACC than an appropriate reference food (SS 101.54(e)). Synonyms for each of these terms also are set forth in our regulations; for example, the terms \"rich in\" and \"excellent source of\" are considered to be equivalent to the term \"high\" (SS 101.54(b)) (79 FR 23262 at 23263, footnote 1).\n\nC. Which Statute Established a Notification Process for Nutrition Content Claims?\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) amended the FD&C Act to provide, among other things, for the filing of notifications as an alternative to the petition process for nutrient content claims set forth in section 403(r)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(4)) (see section 403(r)(2)(G) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(2)(G)).\n\nAppendix D What are the Requirements for Submitting a Notification for a Prospective Nutrient Content Claim?\n\nSection 403(r)(2)(G) of the FD&C Act requires that a notification for a prospective nutrient content claim be submitted to FDA at least 120 days before a food bearing the claim may be introduced into interstate commerce. The notification must contain specific information including: (1) The exact wording of the prospective nutrient content claim, (2) a concise description of the basis upon which the notifier relied for determining that the requirements for an authoritative statement in section 403(r)(2)(G)(i) of the FD&C Act have been satisfied, (3) a copy of the authoritative statement that serves as the basis for the claim, and (4) a balanced representation of the scientific literature relating to the nutrient level for the claim. The claim must be an accurate representation of the authoritative statement and must be stated in a manner that enables the public to comprehend the information provided by the claim and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of the total daily diet. Furthermore, the authoritative statement that is the basis for the nutrient content claim must be currently in effect and identify the nutrient level to which the claim refers (section 403(r)(2)(G) of the FD&C Act).\n\nAppendix E Who can provide an authoritative statement that identifies the nutrient level to which the Nutrient Content Claim refers?\n\nAccording to section 403(r)(2)(G)(i) of the FD&C Act, an authoritative statement that identifies the nutrient level to which the claim refers can be provided by a scientific body of the U.S. Government with official responsibility for public health protection or research directly relating to human nutrition, or by the National Academy of Sciences or any of its subdivisions, such as the Institute of Medicine.\n\nAppendix III What Types of Nutrient Content Claims are Prohibited by the Rule?\n\nThe rule prohibits the nutrient content claims for DHA and EPA set forth in the seafood processors, Martek, and Ocean Nutrition notifications (the three notifications) and nutrient content claims for ALA based on a population-weighted approach set forth in the seafood processors notification.\n\nIn brief, the seafood processors notification set forth \"high\" nutrient content claims for both DHA and EPA, whereas the Martek notification set forth a \"high\" nutrient content claim only for DHA and the Ocean Nutrition notification set forth a \"high\" nutrient content claim for DHA and EPA combined. In addition, the seafood processors notification set forth \"high,\" \"good source,\" and \"more\" claims for ALA (79 FR 23262 at 23263).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Alpha-Linolenic Acid, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, and Docosahexaenoic Acid Omega-3 Fatty Acids Nutrient Content Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.346736431121826"], "Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: The BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nAn exclusivity period for the first biological product determined to be interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use, during which a second or subsequent biological product may not be determined interchangeable with that reference product (see section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act)\n\nProcedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(l) of the PHS Act)\n\nTransition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously would have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below:\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class4 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010. Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term \u201cproduct class\u201d for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term \u201creference product\u201d means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)\") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\" provision\n\nFDA's Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s draft guidance for industry The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.891510963439941", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n\nExamples of biological products approved under the FD&C Act are listed in the Appendix to the Transition Policy Final Guidance. To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA's electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from \"NDA\" to \"BLA\") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA's Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA's preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA's website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA's draft guidance for industry Implementation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended definition of \"biological product\" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.641688346862793", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Section 607 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, redesignated section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act as section 7002(e)(4)(A) and added the title \u201cIn General\u201d to the new subparagraph. Confoming revisions have been made throughout this guidance to refer to the new subparagraph.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the \"Hatch-Waxman Amendments\"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger, and typically more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system, such as a microorganism or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines \"biosimilarity\" to mean \"that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for \"interchangeability,\" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\n2 Transition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a biological product (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below.\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class5 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA has interpreted the statutory term_product class_ for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period(see FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCIAct (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance), at Q. II.2). We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory:information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"6 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for a biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed BLA\") on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B) of the BPCI Act). For additional information about FDA's interpretation of this \"transition\" provision, please refer to FDA's guidance for industry Interpretation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (December 2018) (Transition Policy Final Guidance).\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nIdentification of Products Subject to the Transition Provision\n\n1 What products are affected by the transition provision? How will the holder of an approved new drug application (NDA) for a biological product know if it will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nThe \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act (also known as the transition provision) will apply on March 23, 2020, to each approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act.7 The BPCI Act and Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, amended the definition of a \"biological product\" in section 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a \"protein.\"\n\nFootnote 7: General references in this guidance to \u201capplications\u201d submitted or approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act also may include ANDAs, to the extent applicable. An ANDA generally must contain information to demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug has the same active ingredient(s), conditions of use, dosage form, route of administration, strength, and (with certain permissible differences) labeling as the reference listed drug (section 505(i)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). Given the complexity of protein molecules and limitations of current analytical methods, it may be difficult for manufacturers of proposed protein products to demonstrate that the active ingredient in their proposed product is the same as the active ingredient in an already approved product, and thus ANDAs are not a focus of this guidance. There are no currently marketed bio logical products that were approved through the ANDA pathway.\n\nFDA has previously stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended statutory definition of \"biological product.\"8 As explained in FDA's final rule entitled \"Definition of the Term \"Biological Product\" (Biological Product Definition Final Rule), FDA interprets the term \"protein\" to mean any alpha amino acid polymer with a specific defined sequence that is greater than 40 amino acids in size. When two or more amino acid chains in an amino acid polymer are associated with each other in a manner that occurs in nature, the size of the amino acid polymer for purposes of this interpretation will be based on the total number of amino acids in those chains, and will not be limited to the number of amino acids in a contiguous sequence.9 FDA interprets the statutory definition of \"biological product\" such that any amino acid polymer composed of 40 or fewer amino acids (i.e., a \"peptide\") is outside the scope of the term \"protein.\" A \"peptide\" is not a \"biological product\" and will continue to be regulated as a drug under the FD&C Act unless the peptide otherwise meets the statutory definition of a \"biological product\" (e.g., a peptide vaccine) (see Q. II.1 in FDA's draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Q&As on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2) (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance)). Moreover, a drug product that contains a protein only as an inactive ingredient (e.g., a drug product formulated with human serum albumin as an inactive ingredient) is not considered to be a \"protein\" for purposes of the statutory definition of \"biological product\" and the transition provision of the BPCI Act.\n\nFootnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.671655535697937", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule \u201cRequirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products\u201d (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule \u201cContent and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling\u201d (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095\u201396).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8357053995132446", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Office of Medical Policy, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Bldg. 51, rm. 6337, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information related to the submission of a BLA under section 351(k) of the PHS Act have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0719, and the collections of information in 21 CFR part 601 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0338.\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collection provisions in this guidance, including resulting proposed modifications to the information collections approved under OMB control number 0910-0338, have been submitted to OMB for review as required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and are not for current implementation. Before implementing the information collection provisions contained in this guidance, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing OMB's decision to approve, modify, or disapprove those information collection provisions.\n\n6 Glossary\n\nBiosimilar Product means a biological product submitted in a 351(k) application that has been shown to be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product (see section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act).\n\nCore Name means the component shared among an originator biological product and any related biological product, biosimilar product, or interchangeable product as part of the proper names of those products. Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoeetin alfa.\n\nInterchangeable Product means a biological product that has been shown to meet the standards described in section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act and may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nNonproprietary Name means a name unprotected by trademark rights that is in the public domain. It may be used by the public at large, both lay and professional.\n\nOriginator Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) that is not a related biological product.\n\nProper Name means the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act.18\n\nFootnote 18: Section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(1)(B)(i) and \u00a7 600.3(k)( 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nProprietary Name means the trademark or brand name.\n\nReference Product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nRelated Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) for which there is a previously licensed biological product submitted in a different section 351(a) BLA that contains a drug substance for which certain nomenclature conventions (e.g., United States Adopted Names (USAN) Guiding Principles19) would be expected to provide for use of the same drug substance name.20\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9004076719284058", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 49: See the draft guidance for industry Comparative Analyses and Related Comparative Use Human Factors Studies for a Drug-Device Combination Product Submitted in an ANDA (January 2017). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAs a general matter, in assessing the therapeutic equivalence of a proposed generic drug-device combination product, FDA intends to consider whether the proposed generic product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.50 While FDA does not expect the proposed generic combination product and its RLD to be identical in all respects, any differences identified between a proposed generic combination product and its RLD should be adequately analyzed, scientifically justified, and otherwise not preclude approval under an ANDA. The extent to which differences between the proposed generic combination product and the RLD affect the approximability of the ANDA product will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 314.3. See also the Orange Book, preface to the 41({}^{\\text{a}}) edition, at page vii.\n\nAppendix C Biologic-Led Combination Products\n\nBiologic-led combination products are licensed through one of the two BLA pathways under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), either under a section 351(a) BLA (i.e.,a stand-alone BLA) or under a section 351(k) BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product.51\n\nFootnote 52: Section 351(a)(2)(C) of the PHS Act.\n\n3.2.1 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) Submitted Under Section 351(a)\n\nTo be licensed, a biological product must be shown to be safe, pure, and potent, and the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held must meet standards designed to ensure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.52 A BLA submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act is a stand-alone application in that all of the information and data necessary to demonstrate that these requirements are met are included in the application. This pathway is generally appropriate for biologic-led combination products other than products that are proposed to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a previously licensed biological product.53\n\nFootnote 52: See footnote 17.\n\nFor example, this pathway would be appropriate for the following products when the sponsor is not seeking to rely on FDA's license of another biological product in order to demonstrate biosimilarity to, or interchangeability with, such product:\n\na gene therapy combined with a specialized delivery catheter\n\na vaccine in a pre-filled syringe\n\na protein product in an autoinjector\n\n_BLAs for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Submitted Under Section 351(k)_Section 351(k) of the PHS Act sets forth the requirements for the licensure of biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.54 Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean that the product \"is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences\" between the two products with respect to safety, purity, and potency. To meet the interchangeability standard, an applicant must show that its product \"is biosimilar to the reference product,\" and must further show that the product \"can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient\" and that, for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, \"the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the [two products] is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.\"55 Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nFDA has published guidance indicating the availability of this abbreviated pathway for combination products, as well as considerations related to demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability of such products. With respect to demonstrating biosimilarity, Q.I.4 of the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance) states that some design differences in the delivery device used with the proposed biosimilar product may be permissible, and explains that it may be possible to obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product in a pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, for example, even though the reference product is a biological product licensed in a vial presentation, provided that the proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standard for biosimilarity.\n\nThe Biosimilars Q&A Guidance also explains that licensure under section 351(k) would not be possible if design difference in a delivery device results in any of the following:\n\nA clinically meaningful difference between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nA different route of administration;\n\nA condition of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) for which the reference product has not been previously approved; or\n\nA proposed biosimilar product that otherwise does not meet the standard for biosimilarity.\n\nSee Biosimilars Q&A Guidance for considerations for seeking licensure of a combination product as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product.\n\nAnnex\n\nAnalysis of Pathway Availability for Device-Led Combination Products - Illustrative Examples\n\nTo date, questions regarding pathway availability for combination products have focused most often on device-led combination products. Accordingly, we have included this annex to address common questions utilizing the analyses discussed in section IV.1. The outcomes are also consistent with the expectations discussed in section III, that the application enable evaluation substantially similar to that which would occur if the constituent parts were reviewed under separate applications for the use.\n\nThese hypothetical examples are not intended to reflect a complete analysis of the premarket review considerations that need to be addressed for the types of products discussed in the examples or other types of combination products. In addition, specific products may raise distinct issues that are not taken into account in the examples below. If manufacturers have specific questions relating to their particular products, the Agency recommends that they contact the lead center for the product or OCP, as needed, for assistance.\n\nFor the purposes of the illustrative examples below, it is assumed that the sponsor submitted a 510(k) to CDRH for the combination product.\n\nExample 1: Antimicrobial coating added for the first time to a previously classified device type\n\nPredicate Product:\n\nA previously classified hypothetical class II device (product has no drug or biological product constituent part), which is subject to 510(k) requirements (e.g., an externally-communicating device intended to be implanted in the abdominal cavity for drainage of excessive fluids).\n\nDrug Constituent Part:\n\nA hypothetical antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) that contains the same active ingredient that is in an NDA drug product approved for intravenous administration that has a well-established and understood risk profile as an antimicrobial indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The sponsor has provided FDA documentation of a right of reference to the NDA.56\n\nFootnote 56: Alternatively, the sponsor could rely on FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the NDA approved antimicrobial product, provided all of the requirements of 503(g)(5)(A) and (C) are satisfied and it is scientifically justified. FDA may then consider such findings in its review of a device premarket submission.\n\nNew Product:\n\nThe sponsor proposes to add an antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) to the predicate product described above, making a single-entity combination product (hereinafter referred to as Product A). The purpose of adding the antimicrobial to this device is to prevent infections associated with the surgical procedure and continued use of the product. The sponsor requests the product be considered substantially equivalent to the previously cleared uncoated version of the device. An antimicrobial drug product has never been combined with this devicetype. To make a substantial equivalence determination, the following questions are generally asked:\n\nIs the predicate product legally marketed? Yes.\n\nDoes the predicate product have the same intended use? While both the predicate and the new combination product are intended to drain excessive fluid from the abdominal cavity, the addition of the proposed drug constituent part and the indication of preventing infection are not applicable to the predicate product. These changes raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, precluding a meaningful comparison with the predicate product.57 Therefore, these changes in indications for use of the product and of adding the constituent part would result in a new intended use, and the product would be found not substantially equivalent (NSE). Also, the addition of Antimicrobial A is a different technological characteristic that would raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 57: See 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5) and the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.9084079265594482"], "Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical?

This can include information on:\n\nThe ability of analytical procedures to detect impurities in the starting material;\n\nThe fate and purge of those impurities and their derivatives in subsequent processing steps;\n\nHow the proposed specification for each starting material will contribute to the control strategy.\n\nThe applicant should provide, as part of the justification, a flow diagram outlining the current synthetic route(s) for the manufacture of the drug substance, with the proposed starting materials clearly indicated. Changes to the starting material specification and to the synthetic route from the starting material to final drug substance are subject to regional, post-approval change requirements. In addition, regional requirements concerning starting material suppliers may also be applicable.\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material. A commercially available chemical is usually one that is sold as a commodity in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market in addition to its proposed use as starting material. Chemicals produced by custom syntheses are not considered to be commercially available. If a chemical from a custom synthesis is proposed as a starting material, it should be justified in accordance with the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1.\n\nIn some instances, additional purification steps by the drug substance manufacturer might be called for to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material.

A proposed starting material may be defined downstream from a commercially available chemical, provided that there are multiple chemical transformation steps between the proposed starting material and the drug substance, and provided the justification addresses the ICH Q11 general principles. The presence of a \"significant structural fragment\" should not be the sole basis for starting material selection. Starting materials justified solely on the basis that they are a \"significant structural fragment\" probably will not be accepted by regulatory authorities, as the other general principles for the appropriate selection of a proposed starting material should also be considered.\n\n[5.6] What is the difference between a commercially available chemical and a custom synthesised chemical?\n\n[5.7] ICH Q11 states that \"a commercially available chemical is usually one that is sold as a commodity in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market in addition to its proposed use as starting material\". A definition of \"custom synthesised chemical\" was not provided in ICH Q11, but a custom synthesised chemical is generally understood to be one that is made specifically to a drug substance manufacturer's requirement, either in-house or externally, or available for purchase but where the only use is for pharmaceutical manufacture.

The ICH Q11 general principles apply to processes where multiple chemical transformations are performed without isolation of intermediates. In the absence of such isolations (e.g., crystallization, or starting materials and precipitation), design of the manufacturing process (e.g., kinetics) and/or unit operations (e.g., extraction, distillation, the use of scavenging agents) should be in place to adequately control and/or purge impurities and be described in the application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.5297892093658447", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: The full bibliographic reference should be cited close to where the reference appears in the text of the application (e.g., in a footnote or section endnote). The full text of the literature cited (e.g., journal article) should be included in the Literature References section, except when otherwise indicated. For example, as previously stated in this guidance, monographs from an official compendium need not be included in the application.\n\nAttachment 1:\n\nStarting materials for synthetic drug substances\n\nA starting material for a synthetic drug substance is a chemical compound of defined molecular structure that contributes to the structure of the drug substance. A reagent that contributes a minor structural element to the drug substance (e.g., hydride ion) is not considered to fall within the meaning of starting material. A synthesis can be linear or convergent. Therefore, an applicant should propose one or more starting materials to mark the beginning of each synthesis branch.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing process in an application begins with the starting material or materials. Appropriate GMPs, as defined in ICH Q7A, can apply to the manufacturing steps after introduction of the starting material. Because there is limited FDA oversight of the manufacturing of the starting material, the starting material should be selected and controlled so that the risk from future changes in the quality of the starting material affecting the identity, quality, purity, or potency of the drug substance is minimized. A proposed starting material should be chosen so that sufficient information will be available to the FDA on the manufacturing process to evaluate the safety and quality of the drug substance. A drug substance that is used to synthesize another drug substance is not an appropriate candidate for designation as a starting material. An applicant can discuss the selection of proposed starting materials prior to submitting its application.\n\nThe extent of information that should be submitted in the application to justify the proposed starting materials depends on whether or not the chemical has a significant nonpharmaceutical market. FDA will consider the justification provided to support a proposed starting material as well as other relevant information such as the proposed starting material specification and controls on manufacturing steps downstream from the proposed starting material when evaluating the appropriateness of a proposal to designate a chemical as a starting material.\n\nStarting Materials with a Significant Nonpharmaceutical Market\n\nA significant nonpharmaceutical market is considered to exist if the quantity of the chemical needed for the production of the drug substance represents only a small fraction of the chemical's total market. This is true whether the chemical is made by the drug substance manufacturer for its own use or is obtained from another firm. If the quality of the chemical made for the nonpharmaceutical market is insufficient to ensure consistent quality of the drug substance and the chemical is further processed to produce material of higher quality, the purification operations should be described as part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance (S.2.2). See section II of this attachment for recommendations on the documentation that should be provided for these starting materials.\n\nStarting Materials without a Significant Nonpharmaceutical Market\n\nA chemical should not be considered to have a significant nonpharmaceutical market if (1) the only market for the chemical is to manufacture drug substance; (2) the drug substancemanufacturer had to synthesize the chemical, or arrange for another firm to synthesize it, to produce drug substance for clinical trials; (3) an existing manufacturer of the chemical had to scale up its process to produce sufficient quantities of drug substance for clinical trials; or (4) the method of manufacture was provided by the drug substance manufacturer to the other firms that manufacture the chemical. See sections I and II of this attachment, respectively, for selection principles and recommendations on the documentation that should be provided for these starting materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #169 Drug Substance Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.9811495542526245", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: A starting material is incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the drug substance. \"Significant structural fragment\" in this context is intended to distinguish starting materials from reagents, solvents, or other raw materials. Commonly available chemicals used to create salts, esters or other simple derivatives should be considered reagents.\n\nAll the general principles above should be considered in selecting Starting Material(s), rather than strictly applying each general principle in isolation (see Example 4, Section 10.4).\n\n5.1.2 Selection of Starting Materials for Semi-Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nFor purposes of this guideline, a semi-synthetic drug substance is one in which the structural constituents have been introduced by a combination of chemical synthesis and elements of biological origin (e.g., obtained from fermentation or by extraction from botanical material). In some cases, it might be appropriate for the applicant to describe the manufacturing process starting from the source material (microorganism or botanical material). However, if it can be demonstrated that one of the isolated intermediates in the synthetic process complies with the principles outlined above for the selection of starting materials for synthetic drug substances, that isolated intermediate can be proposed as the starting material. The applicant should specifically evaluate whether it is possible to analytically characterise the proposed starting material, including its impurity profile, and whether the fermentation or botanical material and extraction process impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. Risks from microbial and other contamination should also be addressed.\n\n5.1.3 Selection of Source and Starting Materials for Biotechnological/Biological Drug Substances\n\nCell banks are the starting point for manufacture of biotechnological drug substances and some biological drug substances. In some regions, these are referred to as source materials; in others, starting materials. Guidance is contained in ICH Q5A, Q5B, and Q5D.\n\nSubmission of Information for Starting Material or Source Material\n\nApplicants should identify all proposed starting materials or source materials and provide appropriate specifications. Proposed starting materials for synthetic and semi-synthetic drug substances should be justified.\n\n5.2.1 Justification of Starting Material Selection for Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nThe applicant should provide a justification for how each proposed starting material is appropriate in light of the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1. This can include information on:\n\nThe ability of analytical procedures to detect impurities in the starting material;\n\nThe fate and purge of those impurities and their derivatives in subsequent processing steps;\n\nHow the proposed specification for each starting material will contribute to the control strategy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6071710586547852"], "As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: Stability studies should include testing of stability-indicating attributes of the API, i.e. those that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological and microbiological attributes. A guide to the potential attributes to be tested in the stability studies is provided in Appendix 1.\n\nValidated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed will depend on the results from validation studies [7, 8].\n\n2.1.6 Testing frequency\n\nFor long-term studies, the frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the API.\n\nFor APIs with a proposed retest period or shelf life of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every three months over the first year, every six months over the second year, and annually thereafter throughout the proposed retest period or shelf life.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g. 0, 3 and 6 months), from a six-month study is recommended. Where it is expected (based on development experience) that results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, additional testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or by including a fourth time point in the study design. When testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g. 0, 6, 9 and 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\n2.1.7 Storage conditions\n\nIn general, an API should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage and shipment.\n\nStorage condition tolerances are defined as the acceptable variations in temperature and RH of storage facilities for stability studies. The equipment used should be capable of controlling the storage conditions within the ranges defined in these guidelines. The storage conditions should be monitored and recorded. Short-term environmental changes due to opening the doors of the storage facility are accepted as unavoidable. The effect of excursions due to equipment failure should be assessed, addressed and reported if judged to affectstability results. Excursions that exceed the defined tolerances for more than 24 hours should be described in the study report and their effects assessed.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7930160760879517", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: Storage condition tolerances are defined as the acceptable variations in temperature and RH of storage facilities for stability studies.

For new APIs, the long-term testing should normally have taken place over a minimum of 12 months for the number of batches specified in section 2.1.3 at the time of submission, and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period or shelf life. For existing APIs, data covering a minimum of six months may be submitted. Additional data accumulated during the period while the registration application is being assessed should be submitted to the authorities when submitting data in response to outstanding questions. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition, can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for APIs are detailed in sections 2.1.7.1-2.1.7.3. The general case applies if the API is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at 25 ({}^{\\circ})C (\\pm) 2 ({}^{\\circ})C/60% RH (\\pm) 5% RH and \"significant change\" occurs at any time during six months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. In this case, testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all long-term tests, unless otherwise justified, and the initial application should include a minimum of six months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\n\"Significant change\" for an API is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\n2.1.7.2 Active pharmaceutical ingredients intended for storage in a refrigerator\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7899501323699951", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: At the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g. 0, 3 and 6 months), from a six-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that results from accelerated testing are likely to approach significant change criteria, testing should be increased either by adding samples at the final time point or by including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g. 0, 6, 9 and 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nThe initial date of storage should be considered t0 and stability time points should be defined as a date with respect to t0. For example, if t0 is 1 January 2020 then the one-month time point corresponds to either 1 February or 31 January 2020. For each time point, samples should be withdrawn and tested as per the protocol. Testing should be completed as soon as possible. Deviations from the protocol should be recorded and justified.\n\nReduced designs, i.e. matrixing or bracketing, where the testing frequency is reduced or certain factor combinations are not tested at all, can be applied if justified (refer to ICH Q1D).\n\nStorage conditions\n\nStability data must demonstrate stability of the medicinal product throughout its intended shelf life under the climatic conditions prevalent in the target countries. Merely applying the same requirements appropriate to other markets could potentially lead to substandard products if stability studies are conducted at the storage conditions for countries in Climatic Zone I/II when the products are supplied in countries in Climatic Zones III and IV.\n\nIn general an FPP should be evaluated under storage conditions with specified tolerances that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture or potential for solvent loss. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment and subsequent use with due regard to the climatic conditions in which the product is intended to be marketed.\n\nThe orientation of the product during storage, i.e. upright, on the side or inverted, as well as the rationale for the orientation, may need to be included in aprotocol where contact of the product with the closure system may be expected to affect the stability of the products contained (e.g. liquids and semisolids), or where there has been a change in the container-closure system.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.26843979954719543", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: The data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at them that the requested retest period or shelf life will be granted. Under these circumstances it is normally unnecessary to go through the statistical analysis.\n\nOne approach for analysing the data on a quantitative attribute that is expected to change with time is to determine the time at which the 95% one-sided confidence limit for the mean curve intersects the acceptance criterion. If analysis shows that the batch-to-batch variability is small, it is advantageous to combine the data into one overall estimate. This can be done by first applying appropriate statistical tests (e.g. (P) values for level of significance of rejection of more than 0.25) to the slopes of the regression lines and zero time intercepts for the individual batches. If it is inappropriate to combine data from several batches, the overall retest period or shelf life should be based on the minimum time a batch can be expected to remain within acceptance criteria.\n\nThe nature of any degradation relationship will determine whether the data should be transformed for linear regression analysis. Usually the relationship can be represented by a linear, quadratic or cubic function on an arithmetic or logarithmic scale. As far as possible the choice of model should be justified by a physical and/or chemical rationale and should also take into account the amount of available data (parsimony principle to ensure a robust prediction). Statistical methods should be employed to test the goodness of fit of the data on all batches and combined batches (where appropriate) to the assumed degradation line or curve.\n\nLimited extrapolation of the long-term data from the long-term storage condition beyond the observed range to extend the retest period or shelf life can be undertaken if justified. This justification should be based on what is known about the mechanism of degradation, the results of testing under accelerated conditions, the goodness of fit of any mathematical model, batch size and existence of supporting stability data. However, this extrapolation assumes that the same degradation relationship will continue to apply beyond the observed data (please refer to ICH Q1E).\n\nAny evaluation should cover not only the assay but also the levels of degradation products and other stability-indicating attributes.\n\n2.1.10 Statements and labelling\n\nA storage statement should be established for display on the label based on the stability evaluation of the API. Where applicable, specific instructions should be provided, particularly for APIs that cannot tolerate freezing or excursions in temperature. Terms such as \"ambient conditions\" or \"room temperature\" should be avoided.\n\nThe recommended labelling statements for use when supported by the stability studies are provided in Appendix 2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9476208090782166", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: The objective of stress testing is to identify primary degradation products and not to completely degrade the API. The conditions studied should cause degradation to occur to a small extent, typically 10-30% loss of API as determined by assay when compared with non-degraded API. The target should be chosen so that some degradation occurs, but not enough to generate secondary products. For this reason, the conditions and duration may need to be varied when the API is especially susceptible to a particular stress factor. In the total absence of degradation products after 10 days the API is considered stable under the particular stress condition. However, in this case the stress conditions employed should be justified.\n\nAlthough examining degradation products under stress conditions is useful in establishing degradation pathways and developing and validating suitable analytical procedures, it may not be necessary to examine specifically for certain degradation products if it has been demonstrated that they are not formed under accelerated or long-term storage conditions.\n\nResults from these studies will form an integral part of the information provided to regulatory authorities.\n\nSelection of batches\n\nThe requirements that follow are not intended to apply to variations; these are covered in section 2.2.12 Variations.\n\nData from stability studies on at least three primary batches of the API should normally be provided. The batches should be manufactured at a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthesis route as production batches, and using a method of manufacture and a procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of API placed on stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nContainer-closure system\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the API packaged in a container-closure system that is the same as, or simulates, the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\n2.1.5 Specification\n\nStability studies should include testing of stability-indicating attributes of the API, i.e. those that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological and microbiological attributes. A guide to the potential attributes to be tested in the stability studies is provided in Appendix 1.\n\nValidated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed will depend on the results from validation studies [7, 8].\n\n2.1.6 Testing frequency\n\nFor long-term studies, the frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the API.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.6412858963012695", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.2 Testing for poolability of batches\n\n2.2.1 Analysis of covariance\n\nBefore pooling the data from several batches to estimate a retest period or shelf life, a preliminary statistical test should be performed to determine whether the regression lines from different batches have a common slope and a common time-zero intercept. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) can be employed, where time is considered the covariate, to test the differences in slopes and intercepts of the regression lines among batches. Each of these tests should be conducted using a significance level of 0.25 to compensate for the expected low power of the design due to the relatively limited sample size in a typical formal stability study.\n\nIf the test rejects the hypothesis of equality of slopes (i.e., if there is a significant difference in slopes among batches), it is not considered appropriate to combine the data from all batches. The retest periods or shelf lives for individual batches in the stability study can be estimated by applying the approach described in Appendix section B.1 using individual intercepts and individual slopes and the pooled mean square error calculated from all batches. The shortest estimate among the batches should be chosen as the retest period or shelf life for all batches.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the test rejects the hypothesis of equality of intercepts but fails to reject that the slopes are equal (i.e., if there is a significant difference in intercepts but no significant difference in slopes among the batches), the data can be combined for the purpose of estimating the common slope. The retest periods or shelf lives for individual batches in the stability study should be estimated by applying the approach described in Appendix section B.1, using the common slope and individual intercepts. The shortest estimate among the batches should be chosen as the retest period or shelf life for all batches.\n\nIf the tests for equality of slopes and equality of intercepts do not result in rejection at a level of significance of 0.25 (i.e., if there is no significant difference in slope and intercepts among the batches), the data from all batches can be combined. A single retest period or shelf life can be estimated from the combined data by using the approach described in Appendix section B.1 and applied to all batches. The estimated retest period or shelf life from the combined data is usually longer than that from individual batches because the width of the confidence limit(s) for the mean will become narrower as the amount of data increases when batches are combined.\n\nThe pooling tests described above should be performed in a proper order such that the slope terms are tested before the intercept terms. The most reduced model (i.e., individual slopes, common slope with individual intercepts, or common slope with common intercept, as appropriate) can be selected for retest period or shelf life estimation.\n\n4.2.2 Other methods\n\nStatistical procedures (Ruberg and Stegeman 1991; Ruberg and Hsu 1992; Shao and Chow 1994; Murphy and Weisman 1990; Yoshioka et al. 1997) other than those described above can be used in retest period or shelf life estimation. For example, if it is possible to decide in advance the acceptable difference in slope or in mean retest period or shelf life among batches, an appropriate procedure for assessing the equivalence in slope or in mean retest period or shelf life can be used to determine the data poolability. However, such a procedure should be prospectively defined, evaluated, and justified and, where appropriate, discussed with the regulatory authority. A simulation study can be useful, if applicable, to demonstrate that the statistical properties of the alternative procedure selected are appropriate (Chen et al. 1997).\n\nData Analysis for Multi-Factor, Full-Design Studies\n\nThe stability of the drug product could differ to a certain degree among different factor combinations in a multi-factor, full-design study. Two approaches can be considered when analyzing such data.\n\nThe objective of the first approach is to determine whether the data from all factor combinations support the proposed shelf life.\n\nThe objective of the second approach, testing for poolability, is to determine whether the data from different factor combinations can be combined for an overall estimate of a single shelf life.\n\nb.3.1 Evaluating whether all factor combinations support the proposed shelf life\n\nThe objective of this approach is to evaluate whether the estimated shelf lives from all factor combinations are longer than the one proposed. A statistical model that includes all appropriate factors and factor combinations should be constructed as described in Appendix section B.3.2.2.1, and the shelf life should be estimated for each level of each factor and factor combination.\n\nIf all shelf lives estimated by the original model are longer than the proposed shelf life, further model building is considered unnecessary and the proposed shelf life will generally be appropriate as long as the guidance in sections II.D and II.E is followed. If one or more of the estimated shelf lives fall short of the proposed shelf life, model building as described in Appendix section B.3.2.2.1 can be employed. However, it is considered unnecessary to identify the final model before evaluating whether the data support the proposed shelf life. Shelf lives can be estimated at each stage of the model building process, and if all shelf lives at any stage are longer than the one proposed, further attempts to reduce the model are considered unnecessary.\n\nThis approach can simplify the data analysis of a complicated multi-factor stability study compared to the data analysis described in Appendix section B.3.2.2.1.\n\nb.3.2 Testing for poolability\n\nThe stability data from different combinations of factors should not be combined unless supported by statistical tests for poolability.\n\nb.3.2.1 Testing for poolability of batch factor only\n\nIf each factor combination is considered separately, the stability data can be tested for poolability of batches only, and the shelf life for each non-batch factor combination can be estimated separately by applying the procedure described in Appendix section B.2. For example, for a drug product available in two strengths and four container sizes, eight sets of data from the 2x4 strength-size combinations can be analyzed and eight separate shelf lives should be estimated accordingly. If a single shelf life is desired, the shortest estimated shelf life among all factor combinations should become the shelf life for the product. However, this approach does not take advantage of the available data from all factor combinations, thus generally resulting in shorter shelf lives than does the approach in Appendix section B.3.2.2.\n\nb.3.2.2 Testing for poolability of all factors and factor combinations\n\nIf the stability data are tested for poolability of all factors and factor combinations and the results show that the data can be combined, a single shelf life longer than that estimated based on individual factor combinations is generally obtainable. The shelf life is longer because the width of the confidence limit(s) for the mean will become narrower as the amount of data increases when different factors, such as batches, strengths, container sizes, and/or fills, are combined.\n\nb.3.2.2 Analysis of covariance\n\nAnalysis of covariance can be employed to test the difference in slopes and intercepts of the regression lines among factors and factor combinations (Chen et al. 1997; Fairweather et al. 1995). The purpose of the procedure is to determine whether data from multiple factor combinations can be combined for the estimation of a single shelf life.\n\nThe full statistical model should include the intercept and slope terms of all main effects and interaction effects and a term reflecting the random error of measurement. If it can be justified that the higher order interactions are very small, there is generally no need to include these terms in the model. In cases where the analytical results at the initial time point are obtained from the finished dosage form prior to its packaging, the container intercept term can be excluded from the full model because the results are common among the different container sizes and/or fills.\n\nThe tests for poolability should be specified to determine whether there are statistically significant differences among factors and factor combinations. Generally, the pooling tests should be performed in a proper order such that the slope terms are tested before the intercept terms and the interaction effects are tested before the main effects. For example, the tests can start with the slope and then the intercept terms of the highest order interaction, and proceed to the slope and then the intercept terms of the simple main effects. The most reduced model, obtained when all remaining terms are found to be statistically significant, can be used to estimate the shelf lives.\n\nAll tests should be conducted using appropriate levels of significance. It is recommended that a significance level of 0.25 be used for batch-related terms, and a significance level of 0.05 be used for non-batch-related terms. If the tests for poolability show that the data from different factor combinations can be combined, the shelf life can be estimated according to the procedure described in Appendix section B.1 using the combined data.\n\nIf the tests for poolability show that the data from certain factors or factor combinations should not be combined, either of two alternatives can be applied: (1) a separate shelf life can be estimated for each level of the factors and of the factor combinations remaining in the model; or (2) a single shelf life can be estimated based on the shortest estimated shelf life among all levels of factors and factor combinations remaining in the model.\n\nb.3.2.2 Other methods\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1E Evaluation of Stability Data \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.083776473999023"], "Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter V.

What is an \"ingredient\"?\n\nThe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act uses the term \"ingredient\" to refer to the compounds used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement. For instance, when calcium carbonate is used to provide calcium, calcium carbonate is an \"ingredient\" and calcium is a \"dietary ingredient.\" The term \"ingredient\" also refers to substances such as binders, colors, excipients, fillers, flavors, and sweeteners.\n\nPublic Law 103-417, 60 Federal Register 67194 at 67199 (December 28, 1995)\n\n2. What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?Top 0Ingredients that are sources of dietary ingredients may be listed within the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, e.g., \"Calcium (as calcium carbonate).\" When ingredients are listed in this way, they do not have to be listed again in the ingredient statement (also called an ingredient list).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(d)\n\nDo I need an ingredient statement when all of my ingredients are listed in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nNo. If you place all source ingredients in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel and you have no other ingredients, such as excipients or fillers, you do not need an ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nHow must I identify the ingredient list?\n\nYou must precede the ingredient list by the word \"Ingredients,\" except that you must use the words \"Other Ingredients\" when you have identified some ingredients (i.e., as sources) within the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhere must I place the ingredient list on the label?\n\nWhen present, you must place the ingredient list on dietary supplements immediately below the nutrition label, or if there is insufficient space below the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right of the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhat type size must I use for the ingredient list?\n\nYou must display this information prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the types size be less that 1/16 inch in height as measured by the lower case \"0\", or its equivalent, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.105(h)(2).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(c), 21 CFR 101.15, and 21 CFR 101.105(h)(1) and (2)\n\nMust I list the ingredients in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight. This means that the ingredient that weighs the most is first and the ingredient that weighs the least is last.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)\n\nHow must I declare spices, natural flavors, or artificial flavors?\n\nYou must declare these ingredients in ingredient lists by using either specific common or usual names or by using the declarations \"spice,\" \"natural flavor\" or \"artificial flavor,\" or any combination thereof.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(h)(1) and 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nCan I indicate that a spice is also a coloring?\n\nTop 0Yes. Paprika, turmeric, saffron and other spices that are also colorings, may be declared either by name or the term \"spice and coloring.\" For example, paprika may be listed as \"paprika\" or as \"spice and coloring.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.22(a)(2)\n\n10. How must I declare artificial colors?\n\nIt depends on whether or not the artificial color is certified. List a certified color by its specific or abbreviated name, e.g., \"FD&C Red No. 40\" or \"Red 40.\"\n\nA color that is not certified may be listed as an \"Artificial Color,\" \"Artificial Color\n\nAdded,\" \"Color Added,\"or by its specific common or usual name.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(k)(1) and (k)(2)\n\n11. May I use \"and/or\" labeling for fats and oils?\n\nYes. When a blend of fats and/or oils is not the predominant ingredient of your product and you vary the makeup of the blend you may use \"and/or\" labeling or language such as:\n\nINGREDIENTS:...vegetable oil shortening (contains one or more of the following:\n\ncottonseed oil, palm oil, soybean oil).\"\n\n21 CFR 101.4(b)(14)\n\n12.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter \"o,\" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement \"Made in the U. S. A.\"? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements.

A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as \"zero\" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for \"% Daily Value\" that refers to the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, not in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel. Ingredients in dietary supplements that are not dietary ingredients, such as binders, excipients, fillers, must be included in the ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nMust I declare vitamin E when it occurs naturally in my product and I make no claim for it?\n\nNo. Because Vitamin E is not one of the 14 mandatory dietary ingredients, it does not need to be declared when it occurs naturally.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMay I declare protein on the label if my product contains only individual amino acids?\n\nNo. You may not declare protein on your products that contain only amino acids.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMust I list the dietary ingredients in my products in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list \"folic acid\" or \"folacin\" without parentheses in place of \"folate.\" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA's good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency's current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called \"health claims.\"\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn't a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is \"protective against the development of cancer\" or \"reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis\" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are \"relieves crushing chest pain (angina),\" \"improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),\" or \"relief of bronchospasm (asthma).\"\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don't use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman's terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3364277780056", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nYou must identify a dietary supplement by using the term \"dietary supplement\" in the statement of identity, except that you may delete the word \"dietary\" and replace it with the name of the dietary ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., \"calcium supplement\") or an appropriately descriptive term indicating the type of dietary ingredient(s) in your dietary supplement product (e.g., \"herbal supplement with vitamins\").\n\n21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(C), 21 U.S.C. 343(s)(2)(B) and 21 CFR 101.3(g)\n\n3. Can the term \"dietary supplement\" by itself be considered the statement of identity?\n\nYes. This term describes the basic nature of a dietary supplement and therefore is an \"appropriately descriptive term\" that can be used as the product's statement of identity. The statement of identity for a dietary supplement may therefore consist simply of the term \"dietary supplement,\" or \"dietary supplement\" may be part of a longer statement of identity (e.g., \"cod liver oil liquid dietary supplement\"). In either case, the word \"dietary\" may be deleted and replaced by another appropriately descriptive term identifying the contents of the product, such as \"calcium supplement,\" \"herbal supplement\", or \"herbal supplement with vitamins.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.3(g)\n\n4. Should I make the statement of identity stand out?\n\nYes. You must make the statement of identity one of the most important features on the principal display panel. To do this, you must use bold type and a type size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the front panel of your label.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n\n5. How should I place the statement of identity on the principal display panel?\n\nYou must place the statement of identity of your dietary supplement product in lines generally parallel to the base of the package.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter II.

(21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium.

Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), provide RDIs for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, and pregnant and lactating women. The declaration recommendations provided in this guidance can also be applied to the RDIs for these subpopulations.\n\nVII References\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,\" Advisory Report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture.

For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer's website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug.

A pedigree would be required for prescription drug products that are sold, purchased, or traded by a non-ADR after December 1, 2006. In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories.\n\n31. If there are two products on a shelf in a pharmacy, with the same lot number, but one was purchased from an ADR and the other was not, how would the pharmacy know which product came from the ADR and which product came from the non-ADR?\n\nInventory control is a business process. FDA expects firms to be able to identify and differentiate drug products that have been obtained from different sources and maintain appropriate records in compliance with PDMA.\n\n32. Is a pedigree required for inventory acquired through a pharmacy acquisition, merger, or buyout?\n\nNo. The purchase of a pharmacy by another pharmacy would not be considered a wholesale distribution, provided that the drugs purchased by the second pharmacy are dispensed or distributed by that pharmacy in the normal practice of retail pharmacy. Therefore, no pedigree would be required. However, the sale, purchase, or trade of those drugs to another pharmacy or wholesale distributor would be considered a wholesale distribution and a pedigree must be provided if that other pharmacy or distributor is not an ADR. If pedigrees are part of the record for the inventory, they must be provided with the sale, purchase, or trade of the product and retained for the appropriate length of time, as required under 21 CFR SSSS203.50(b) and 203.60(d).\n\nH. Pedigrees\n\n33. What does \"date of each previous transaction\" refer to in 21 C.F.R.\n\nSS 203.50(a)(7)?\n\n\"Date of each previous transaction\" refers to the date of each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the product. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nI. Electronic Pedigrees\n\n34. Will electronic pedigrees that conform to the EPCglobal electronic drug pedigree standards be considered PDMA-compliant? At the time of printing, these standards have not been officially adopted or recognized. Therefore, it is premature for FDA to comment on whether they comply with PDMA requirements.\n\n35. Can paper or electronic pedigrees be used?\n\nSection 203.60(a)(2) states that \"combinations of paper records and electronic records, electronic records and handwritten signatures executed on paper, or paper records and electronic signatures or handwritten signatures executed to electronic records, may be used to meet any of the record and signature requirements of the PDMA.\" Both paper and electronic documents and signatures may be used to meet the pedigree requirement of the Act, provided that the requirements of 21 CFR SS 203.60 are met.\n\nIs RFID the only way to achieve an electronic pedigree?\n\nNo. The PDMA and existing regulations do not require any particular technology for pedigrees. Although FDA has stated on several occasions that RFID is the most promising means to achieve an electronic pedigree, electronic pedigree can also be accomplished using bar codes or other track and trace technologies.\n\nCompliance/Enforcement\n\nWhere should a report be sent if there are concerns regarding a pedigree that has been received?\n\nCriminal activity, possible fraud, diversion, counterfeiting, or any other suspicious activity associated with a pedigree should be reported to FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations at rxdrugcops@oci.fda.gov.\n\nWhat are some examples of issues that might raise questions about the pedigree?\n\nDrugs that are sold below market price\n\nUnexplained gaps in the pedigree\n\nUnexplained differences in ordered product vs. shipped product\n\nUnexplained, unexpected, or unusual changes in supplier chain\n\nUnusual variety of lot numbers relative to the size of the shipment\n\nMultiple, unknown wholesalers from various states listed on the pedigree\n\nIncomplete paperwork, invoices, or other materials that do not match pedigree\n\nPattern of discrepancies in ordered vs. shipped product\n\nDiscrepancies in or missing covert/overt anti-counterfeiting measures\n\nSupplier refuses to provide a wholesale license from the state licensing authority\n\nSupplier wants payment in cash only\n\nA non ADR refuses to provide pedigree documentation\n\nSupplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA. Please see Addendum at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_addendum.pdf\n\n**ADDENDUM to FDA's Guidance for Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers Related to the Preliminary Injunction ordered 12/5/06 in RXUSA Wholesalers, Inc. v. HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding \"each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture\" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.879295825958252", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Does a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n\nNo. PDMA applies only to prescription drugs intended for use by man. However, FDA is aware that many human prescription drugs are sold to veterinarians. Given that the human drugs are subject to section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,the pedigree requirements apply to them under section 503(e). Accordingly, wholesale distributors who are not ADRs must provide a pedigree prior to wholesale distribution of human prescription drugs to veterinarians.\n\nIs a pedigree required for the distribution of drug samples?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(7), the distribution of drug samples by manufacturers and authorized distributor's representatives is exempt from the definition of wholesale distribution, so the pedigree requirement does not apply. However, those distributing drug samples must comply with the separate requirements set forth in 21 USC SSS 353(c) and (d) and 21 CFR Part 203..\n\nIs a pedigree required for medical kits that contain prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as convenience kits?\n\nYes. \"Medical kits\" that contain devices and prescription drugs are combination products under 21 CFR SS3.2(e)(2), which are defined as \"two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of a drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products.\" The \"medical kits\" referred to in the question consist of separable finished devices and drugs that are combined in a kit for ready availability and use together in a medical setting. The drug product in the kit retains its separate form and individual packaging. Although these kits may be assigned to FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) as the lead Center for regulatory review when the primary mode of action of the kit is attributable to its device component, regulations for the drug and the device components continue to apply. Because a prescription drug component of a convenience kit is separable, and in the same form as when distributed independently, it is subject to the same pedigree requirements as when it is independently distributed. The pedigree must contain the drug's lot or control number(s), pursuant to 21 CFR SS203.50(a). We recognize that the convenience kit itself may have a lot or control number that is different than that on the prescription drug component. The outer container of the kit should also list the lot or control number of the prescription drug component so that the integrity of the kit's seal would not have to be compromised to confirm that the drug's lot number is the same as that listed in the pedigree. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nDoes PDMA apply to bulk drug substances?\n\nYes. The PDMA applies to drugs subject to SS 503(b) of the Act (i.e., prescription drugs). Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.1, the requirements in 21 CFR Part 203 apply to wholesale distribution of bulk drug substances.\n\nReturns\n\nIs a pedigree required for prescription drugs that are returned from a pharmacy or a physician's office to a wholesaler?Pursuant to the definition of wholesale distribution and other relevant provisions under SS 503(e) of the Act and 21 CFR Part 203, a pedigree is required for returns from a pharmacy or physician's office to a wholesaler unless that pharmacy or physician's office is an ADR for those prescription drugs. Prescription drugs generally are returned for two reasons: (1) the pharmacy or physician's office ordered too much and returns the drug to the wholesaler or manufacturer from whom they purchased the drugs, or (2) the drug is expired or close to expiring, in which case the product is returned to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which it was purchased, or to a reverse distributor for destruction. Pharmacies and physicians' offices generally are not ADRs, and they would find it extremely difficult to provide a pedigree when they return prescription drugs because they would not have received a pedigree if the drugs were purchased from an ADR.\n\nFDA recognizes the disruption that this could cause to the more than 55,000 pharmacies and the hundreds of thousand physicians' offices in the United States. Therefore, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to allow pharmacies and physicians' offices to return drugs that are expired, damaged, recalled, or in some other non-saleable condition, without having to provide a pedigree, provided that (1) they return the drugs to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which they purchased the drugs, or to a licensed reverse distributor for destruction, and (2) they maintain for a period of three years records that document each return and the source from which the pharmacy or physician's office originally purchased the drugs. If the returned prescription drugs are in saleable condition and may subsequently be sold, purchased, or traded by the wholesaler or reverse distributor, then that wholesaler or reverse distributor would be required and expected to pass a pedigree if they are not an ADR for those prescription drugs. Any subsequent pedigree should reflect that the drugs were sold, purchased, or traded to the pharmacy or physician's office and subsequently returned. Because the wholesaler to which the drugs are returned originally sold them to the pharmacy or physician's office, the wholesaler would have all the necessary information to provide a pedigree, even without the pedigree from the pharmacy or physician's office.\n\nFDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR's customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer's website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n3 Inventory\n\nIs a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.374669313430786", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Supplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA. Please see Addendum at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_addendum.pdf\n\n**ADDENDUM to FDA's Guidance for Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers Related to the Preliminary Injunction ordered 12/5/06 in RXUSA Wholesalers, Inc. v. HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding \"each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture\" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(1)-(5). The court order also enjoins FDA from implementing the language in 21 CFR SS 203.50 that requires pedigrees to include lot and control numbers, dosage, container size, and number of containers. As described in more detail below, however, the preliminary injunction does not affect the statutory requirement that pedigrees contain the dates of all listed transactions and the names and addresses of all parties involved in those transactions. In addition, since the court did not enjoin implementation of 21 CFR SS 203.3(u), a written agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler may limit ADR status to a particular lot number(s), dosage, or the number or size of the containers of prescription drugs. We also note that, without the lot number on the pedigree, it would be extremely difficult to track the inventory that matches the pedigree if the inventory is further sold, purchased or traded. Therefore, FDA recommends that the lot or control number, dosage, and the number and size of the prescription drug containers be included on the pedigree even though it is not required while the preliminary injunction is in effect.\n\nPedigrees for all current and future inventory are affected by the preliminary injunction as long is it remains in effect.\n\nB What is not affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\nPedigrees still must be passed by non-authorized distributors of record (non-ADR) prior to each wholesale distribution. In addition, the court does not mention other pedigree-related regulations or other agency-issued documents relating to the pedigree requirement. Accordingly, those regulations and documents, some of which are described below, are not affected by the preliminary injunction.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.3(u). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, defines \"ongoing relationship\" for the purposes of determining who qualifies as an authorized distributor of record (ADR.) As of December 1, 2006, only thosewholesale distributors who have an ongoing relationship (including a written agreement) with the manufacturer, as that term is defined by this regulation, are exempt from the pedigree requirement.\n\nCompliance Policy Guide (CPG) 160.900, which issued in November 2006, remains in effect until December 1, 2007. The CPG describes how FDA intends to prioritize its enforcement efforts regarding the pedigree requirements in the first year after the effective date of 21 CFR SSS 203.3(u) and 203.50. However, FDA will not enforce 203.50(a) as long as the preliminary injunction remains in effect.\n\nAll other definitions in 21 CFR Part 203 that relate to the pedigree requirement, including but not limited to, the definitions of manufacturer and wholesale distribution, have been in effect since December 2000 and remain in effect despite the injunction.\n\nThe names and addresses of all parties to the transaction and the date of the transactions are required by the statute and must be included in the pedigree.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(b). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, requires all wholesale distributors (both ADRs and non-ADRs) involved in the distribution of a prescription drug to retain a copy of the pedigree for three years. Accordingly, all wholesale distributors that provide or receive pedigrees after December 1, 2006, must retain copies of the pedigrees for three years.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(c). This regulation, which also went into effect on December 1, 2006, provides that a manufacturer that subjects a drug to additional manufacturing processes is not required to provide a pedigree identifying previous sales of the drug or its components.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(d). This regulation also went into effect on December 1, 2006, and requires manufacturers to maintain a current written list of all ADRs, to specify whether each ADR is authorized to distribute all of the manufacturer's drug products or only particular products, to update its list of ADRs on a continuing basis, and to make its list of ADRs available for public inspection or copying. Accordingly, as of December 1, 2006, all manufacturers should have available for public inspection a current list of ADRs that indicates which drug products the ADR is authorized to distribute.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.60. This regulation sets forth certain requirements with respect to the use of electronic records and signatures, record retention, and the availability of records for review and reproduction by FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement officials. This regulation has been in effect since December 2000 and remains in effect despite the injunction.\n\nC Since the court's order only applies to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), does this mean that the statutory requirement that non-ADRs provide pedigrees that include \"each prior sale, purchase, or trade\" of the drugs is still in effect?\n\nYes. The court order does not enjoin FDA from enforcing the statute. The court order affects only the regulations at 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). It has been FDA's longstanding position, consistent with the language of the PDMA and its legislative history, that, 21 CFR SS 203.50 notwithstanding, the statute itself requires non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that documents each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer. FDA recognizes, however, that confusion regarding the pedigree requirement could cause disruptions or delays in the nation's drug distribution system. Accordingly, as long as the court order remains in effect, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, as described below. To this end, FDA does not intend to enforce the statute insofar as it requires pedigrees to contain information regarding each transaction going back to the manufacturer. Rather, FDA intends to permit non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that include information regarding transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the prescription drugs. FDA, however, encourages all wholesalers to provide complete pedigrees documenting each prior transaction involving the prescription drug when that information is available.\n\nAppendix D How will FDA apply the court's order outside of the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) and to wholesale distributors that are not plaintiffs in the lawsuit?\n\nFDA believes that limiting application of the preliminary injunction to either the named plaintiffs or the EDNY could lead to confusion and possible disruptions or delays in the nation's drug distribution system and could provide undue advantage to certain wholesale distributors. Accordingly, to the extent that it could be argued that the injunction should be limited in scope, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion in a manner that is consistent with the court's opinion. To this end, as long as the court's order is in effect, FDA does not intend to initiate any enforcement actions against any wholesalers solely for (1) failing to include lot numbers, dosage, container size, or number of containers on a pedigree; or (2) failing to provide a pedigree that goes back to the manufacturer so long as the pedigree otherwise identifies the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs.\n\nAppendix E How does the court's order impact what FDA said in the Guidance to Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers (http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_qa.pdf)?\n\nTo the extent that Questions 2, 9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 29, and 33 refer to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), as long as the preliminary injunction is in effect, such references are limited to the scope of the court's order. For example, if the question states that a pedigree include information about each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer, then the answer would be limited to including information going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the drugs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.2314690351486206", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Is placing the list of ADRs on the manufacturer's web site adequate to meet the provision of making the list available on request to the public, pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)?\n\nYes. We highly encourage manufacturers to post their ADR list on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible, although they are not required to do so. We note that 21 CFR SS 203.50(d) requires the list to be maintained at the manufacturer's corporate offices even when the list is posted on a website.\n\n8 Where can a pharmacist find the list of ADRs?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)(3), manufacturers are required to make their list of ADRs available to the public upon request. However, we recognize that it may be time consuming to get this information from manufacturers' corporate offices. Therefore, we highly encourage manufacturers to post it on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible. FDA will monitor the accessibility of these lists and determine whether further measures are needed to make this information more readily available to pharmacies.\n\nWhat information does a manufacturer have to provide to a wholesaler to enable that wholesaler to comply with the PDMA?\n\nManufacturers are not required under the PDMA to provide any specific information to wholesale customers. However, the information required under 21 CFR SS 203.50(a) for a pedigree statement may be included in the invoice or similar document that would typically accompany or be associated with any shipment of prescription drug products from a manufacturer to a wholesale distributor. FDA encourages manufacturers to do their part to protect public health by furnishing pedigree information to all of their supply chain partners. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat information does an ADR have to provide to a non-ADR to enable that non-ADR to comply with the PDMA (e.g., to pass a pedigree that lists all prior transactions back to the manufacturer)?\n\nADRs are not required to provide a pedigree, whether they obtained the drug directly from a manufacturer, from an ADR, or from a non-ADR. However, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigrees and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. Therefore, when an ADR sells prescription drugs to another ADR or to a non-ADR, the ADR is encouraged to provide pedigree information obtained at the time of the original purchase of the prescription drugs to its wholesale customers. Each wholesale customer of that ADR, in turn, could then provide updated pedigree information with each successive wholesale distribution. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nIf a wholesaler has ADR status for a particular drug product, but it buys that drug from a non-ADR, is the wholesaler still an ADR for that specific quantity of drugs?\n\nYes. If the specific quantity of drugs purchased from the non-ADR falls within the description contained in the written agreement between that purchasing ADR and the manufacturer, then that purchasing wholesaler would have ADR status for that specific quantity of drugs. However, even though the ADR is not required to provide the pedigree when the product is further distributed, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigree documents and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat definition is used to determine who is a manufacturer and, thus, exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nFor purposes of the PDMA, \"manufacturer\" is defined under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates the definition from 21 CFR SS 201.1.\n\n13 Are contract manufacturers considered \"manufacturers\" under the PDMA?\n\nYes. A contract manufacturer falls within the definition of a \"manufacturer\" under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates by reference the definition of \"manufacturer\" set forth in 21 CFR SS 201.1. FDA has received several inquiries regarding the status of an NDA-holder under 21 CFR SSS 203.3(s)/201.1 when that NDA-holder's prescription drugs are made by a contract manufacturer. Unless the NDA-holder has performed the operations necessary to achieve \"manufacturer\" status under 21 CFR SS 201.1, that NDAholder is not technically a \"manufacturer\" of the drugs within the meaning of the 21 CFR SS 203.3(s). In such instances, the NDA-holder would therefore not be exempt from the pedigree requirements on the grounds that it was a manufacturer. Thus, for purposes of the PDMA pedigree requirements only, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion as follows: In those instances where a third party contract manufacturer manufacturers prescription drugs for an NDA-holder, that NDA-holder may also be regarded as a manufacturer of those drugs for purposes of that NDA-holder's compliance with SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act, entering into ADR agreements for those prescription drugs, and for purposes of pedigrees created for those prescription drugs. This exercise of enforcement discretion is not intended to relieve the contract manufacturer of its obligations as a manufacturer, including its obligation to register under SS 510 of the Act, nor is it intended to require the NDA-holder to file such a registration unless the NDA-holder would otherwise be obligated to do so.\n\n14 Is a repackager or relabeler exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nNo. Relabelers and repackagers are not considered to be manufacturers under 21 CFR SS 201.1. Therefore, unless a repackager or relabeler has ADR status with the manufacturer of that product, they are required to provide a pedigree identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n15 Is a pedigree required if an exclusive distribution agreement exists?\n\nNo, so long as the agreement is in writing. By definition, an exclusivity agreement is a written agreement under which the distributor is authorized to distribute the manufacturer's products for a period or time or for a specified volume of products.\n\nAccordingly, such a written agreement would satisfy the requirements related to ADR status in 21 C.F.R. 203.3(u). Please note that, in such instances, the wholesale distributor named in the agreement would have to be included in the manufacturer's list of ADRs under 21 CFR SS 203.50(d).\n\n16 Do non-ADRs have to provide a pedigree if the customer is a physician's office?\n\nYes. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) requires non-ADRs to provide a pedigree before each wholesale distribution of a drug. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc), wholesale distribution is defined as the distribution of prescription drugs to persons other than a consumer or patient. Although a physician's office is not explicitly mentioned in 21 CFR SS 203.50, which discusses pedigree, it is contemplated within the scope of the language set forth in SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act that a pedigree would be provided because physicians offices are not specifically excluded.\n\n17 Are pharmacies required to provide a pedigree when they transfer drug product between pharmacies?For transfers other than intra-company transfers, unless the transfer of prescription drug product from one pharmacy to another is for a documented medical emergency (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(5)), or the sale is of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(10)), retail pharmacies that are not ADRs for the prescription drug products sold or transferred to other retail pharmacies will have to provide a pedigree.\n\nDoes a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4473911225795746", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: register as drug establishments under section 510 of the Federal Food,\n\nDrug, and cosmetic Act. The determination of whether or not a nuclear\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:43]\n\nThe agency advises that the act (Section 503(b)(2) (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(2)) requires the label of a drug dispensed by prescription to contain the name of a patient when stated in the prescription. Even though the act does not require the patient's name, it does imply that a prescription is written with a particular patient in mind. (See the response to question 9). Further, many states require the patients full name and address on all prescriptions and even when not required by state law, the common accepted practice is for physicians to include the name of the patient on a prescription. The agency recognizes, however, that there are certain differences between traditional pharmacy and nuclear pharmacy. Thus, under the guideline a nuclear pharmacy may prepare a radioactive drug intended for administration to several patients in a multi-dose vial and dispense it provided the dispensing pharmacy engaging in such activities maintains 'a hard copy of the prescription or physician's order as required by section 503(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the pharmacy otherwise complies with all aspects of accepted or traditional pharmacy practice. The guideline contains a more complete discussion of this issue (pages 16-19).\n15. One comment objected to the use of the term \"diluting\" in the guideline. The comment said this gave the impression that pharmacists only \"dilute\" and dispense when in fact when they dilute a product, they must be concerned with factors such as adjusting buffers, bacteriostatic agents and stabilizers. The word \"preparing\" was suggested as a substitute.\n\nThe agency believes that the use of the term \"preparing\" in place of\n*diluting\" may be inappropriate because it could imply that the nuclear\n\npharmacist prepared the radioactive drug rather than just performed some\n\nactivities on a product prepared by a drug manufacturer. However,\n\nbecause \"diluting\" may also not be appropriate, it has been decided for\n\npurposes of this guideline to define the term as including not only\n\nsimple dilution, but also adjustment of such things as buffers,\n\nbacteriostatic agents and stabilizers.\n--------------------\nContext title: Nuclear Pharmacy Guideline Criteria for Determining When to Register as a Drug Establishment \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.24527645111084", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See sections 503B(a)(11) and 503B(d)(4)(A)(iii).\n\n2 Compounding, Generally\n\nCompounded drug products serve an important role for patients whose clinical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product, such as for a patient who has an allergy and needs a medication to be made without a certain dye contained in an FDA-approved drug product, or an elderly patient or a child who cannot swallow a pill and needs a medicine in a liquid form that is not available in an approved product. Drug products for identified individual patients can be compounded by licensed pharmacists in State-licensed pharmacies and Federal facilities and by licensed physicians operating under section 503A of the FD&C Act.8 Drug products can also be compounded by outsourcing facilities for identified individual patients pursuant to prescriptions or for distribution to health care practitioners without receiving prescriptions. Sections 503A and 503B restrict the compounding of drug products that are essentially copies of commercially available (section 503A) or approved drug products (section 503B).\n\nFootnote 8: Section 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be met for a human drug product compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or by a licensed physician, to qualify for exemptions fromsections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act. The conditions applicable to compounders seeking to operate under section 503A are discussed in separate guidance documents applicable to these entities.\n\n3 Compounded Drugs that are Essentially Copies of Approved Drug Products\n\nAlthough compounded drugs can serve an important need, they can also pose a higher risk to patients than FDA-approved drugs. Drug products compounded by outsourcing facilities in accordance with the conditions of section 503B are exempt from FDA drug approval requirements and the requirement to be labeled with adequate directions for use. There are greater assurances of quality when drugs are compounded by outsourcing facilities that meet the conditions of section 503B and CGMP requirements than there are for drugs compounded by entities that are not required to comply with CGMP requirements and are not routinely overseen by FDA. However, as with all compounded drugs, drugs compounded by outsourcing facilities have not undergone FDA premarket review for safety, effectiveness, and quality, and lack a premarket inspection and finding of manufacturing quality that is part of the drug approval process. Because they are subject to a lower regulatory standard, compounded drugs should only be distributed to health care facilities or dispensed to patients to fulfill the needs of patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nAppendix A Definition of Essentially a Copy of an Approved Drug\n\nThe definition of essentially a copy of an approved drug has two components, specified in sections 503B(d)(2)(A) and 503B(d)(2)(B) of the Act. Section 503B(d)(2)(A) applies to a compounded drug that is \"identical or nearly identical\" to an approved drug or an unapproved non-prescription drug. All other compounded drugs are evaluated under section 503B(d)(2)(B). FDA applies these provisions as depicted in the diagrams in Appendices A and B.\n\nThe definition of essentially a copy of an approved drug in section 503B(d)(2) addresses both drug products approved under section 505 and marketed drug products that are not subject to section 503(b) and that are not subject to approval in an application submitted under section 505.\n\nFor purposes of this provision:\n\nApproved drug means a drug product that (1) is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, (2) does not appear on the list described in subsection 503B(a)(4) of drugs that have been withdrawn or removed from the market because such drugs or components of such drugs have been found to be unsafe or not effective.\n\nMarketed drug not subject to section 503(b) and not subject to approval in an application submitted under section 505 means any non-prescription drug product marketed without an approved application.10 We refer to these products as covered OTC drug products throughout the remainder of this guidance document. Footnote 10: This includes unapproved OTC drugs whether they are marketed under FDA\u2019s OTC Drug Monograph Review programovtside the monograph system\n\nA drug appears on the drug shortage list in effect under section 506E if the drug is in \"currently in shortage\" status (and not in \"resolved\" status), as indicated in FDA's drug shortage database.11 Footnote 11: See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/dupshortaes/default.cfm.\n\nIn addition, FDA does not intend to take action against an outsourcing facility for failing to compound in accordance with section 503B(a)(5) if it fills orders for a compounded drug that is essentially a copy of an approved drug that has been discontinued and is no longer marketed.12In the discussion  that follows, in subsection 1, we explain  how we intend to apply  the definition of essentially a copy of an approved drug in section 503B(d)(2) when the compounded  drug is compared to an approved drug, and then in subsection 2, we explain  how we intend to apply this definition  when the compounded  drug is compared to a covered OTC drug product.\n\nApplication of the \"Essentially a Copy\" Definition in Section 503B(d)(2) When the Compounded Drug Is Compared to an Approved Drug (see Appendix A) a. Compounded  drugs that are identical  or nearly identical to an approved drug (section 503B(d)(2)(A)) Under section 503B(d)(2)(A), a compounded  drug is essentially  a copy of an approved drug if the compounded  drug is identical  or nearly identical  to an approved drug unless the approved drug appears on the drug shortage list  in effect under section 506E  at the time of compounding,  distribution,  and dispensing. 1. Identical  or nearly identical (Appendix A, box 1) FDA intends  to consider  a compounded  drug product to be identical  or nearly identical  to an approved drug if the compounded  drug product and the FDA-approved drug have the same: * active ingredient(s), * route of administration,13 Footnote 13: See https://www.fda.gov/Drug/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/DataStandardsManualmonographs/ucm071667.htm. Additionally, if the approved drug can be used (regardless of how it is labeled) by the same route of administration prescribed for the compounded drug, we intend to treat the compounded drug as though it has the same route of administration for purposes of this analysis. For example, if the approved drug is an injectable drug sold in a vial that is labeled for intra-muscular use, but this drug can also be drawn from the vial by a smaller needle for subcutaneous adminis ration, a compounded drug product sold in a similar vial and prescribed for sub-cutaneous use would be considered to have the same route of administration under this analysis.\n\nA compounded  drug product that has all of these characteristics in common with an FDA-approved drug product is essentially  a copy of an approved drug, unless the approved drug appears on FDA's drug shortage list at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing. If a compounded drug product is identical or nearly identical to an approved drug that is not on FDA's drug shortage list at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing, the compounded product is essentially a copy, and an outsourcing facility may not produce it under section 503B.\n\nIn establishing this policy, FDA considered the following. Under section 503B(d)(2)(A), the identical or nearly identical compounded product cannot be exempted from the copying restriction by a prescriber determination that there is a change to the compounded product that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient. Compounded products meeting the criteria outlined above are not expected to contain changes from an approved drug that would produce such a difference.\n\nA compounded drug that is identical, or nearly identical, to an approved drug is not considered essentially a copy if the approved drug is in shortage at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing.16 In such a case, the outsourcing facility can compound the drug provided that it complies with the other conditions of 503B. It is important to patients and prescribers that compounded drugs prepared to address a shortage closely resemble the drug in shortage, and for that reason, the statute seeks to allow compounders to compound drugs that are as close as possible to the drug in shortage.17\n\nFootnote 16: For the purposes of this guidance, distribution means that a compounded human drug product has left the facility in which the drug was compounded. Distribution includes delivery or shipment to a physician\u2019s office, hospital, or other health care setting for administration and dispensing to an agent of a patient or to a patient for the patient\u2019s own use.\n\nA compounded drug product with the characteristics described in our policy would be the same as the approved drug in several important respects. The active ingredient is the substance in a drug product that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or function of the body. Dosage form is the way of identifying the drug in its physical form, and route of administration describes the way a drug is administered to the body. Inactive ingredients (also known as \"excipients\") may include preservatives, dyes, and flavorings. The dosage strength of a drug product indicates the amount of the active ingredient that is present in each dosage.\n--------------------\nContext title: Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of Approved Drug Products Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.150515079498291"], "Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted?

(2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: G. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticals with immune agonistic properties, selection of the start dose using a minimally anticipated biologic effect level (MABEL) should be considered.\n\nDose Escalation and the Highest Dose in a Clinical Trial (3.2)\n\nIn general, the highest dose or exposure tested in the nonclinical studies does not limit the dose-escalation or highest dose investigated in a clinical trial in patients with cancer. When a steep dose- or exposure-response curve for severe toxicity is observed in nonclinical toxicology studies, or when no preceding marker of severe toxicity is available, smaller than usual dose increments (fractional increments rather than dose doubling) should be considered.\n\nDuration and Schedule of Toxicology Studies to Support Initial Clinical Trials (3.3)\n\nIn Phase 1 clinical trials, treatment can continue according to the patient's response, and in this case, a new toxicology study is not called for to support continued treatment beyond the duration of the completed toxicology studies.\n\nThe design of nonclinical studies should be appropriately chosen to accommodate different dosing schedules that might be utilized in initial clinical trials. It is not expected that the exact clinical schedule always will be followed in the toxicological study, but the information provided from the toxicity studies should be sufficient to support the clinical dose and schedule and to identify potential toxicity. For example, one factor that can be considered is the half-life in the test species and the projected (or known) half-life in humans. Other factors could include exposure assessment, toxicity profile, saturation of receptors, etc. Table 1 provides examples of nonclinical treatment schedules that are commonly used in anticancer pharmaceutical development and can be used for small molecules or biopharmaceuticals. In cases where the available toxicology information does not support a change in clinical schedules, an additional toxicology study in a single species is usually sufficient.\n\nDuration of Toxicology Studies to Support Continued Clinical Development and Marketing (3.4)\n\nThe nonclinical data to support Phase 1 and the clinical Phase 1 data would normally be sufficient for moving to Phase 2 and into second or first line therapy in patients with advanced cancer. In support of continued development of an anticancer pharmaceutical for patients with advanced cancer, results from repeat dose studies of 3 months' duration following the intended clinical schedule should be provided prior to initiating Phase 3 studies. For most pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer, nonclinical studies of 3 months' duration are considered sufficient to support marketing.\n\nWhen considering a change in the clinical schedule, an evaluation of the existing clinical data should be conducted to justify such change. If the clinical data alone are inadequate to support the change in schedule, the factors discussed in section III.C (3.3) above should be considered.\n\nCombination of Pharmaceuticals (3.5)\n\nPharmaceuticals planned for use in combination should be well studied individually in toxicology evaluations. Data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. In general, toxicology studies investigating the safety of combinations of pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer are not warranted. If the human toxicity profile of the pharmaceuticals has been characterized, a nonclinical study evaluating the combination is not usually warranted. For studies in which at least one of these compounds is in early stage development (i.e., the human toxicity profile has not been characterized), a pharmacology study to support the rationale for the combination should be provided. This study should provide evidence of increased activity in the absence of a substantial increase in toxicity on the basis of limited safety endpoints, such as mortality, clinical signs, and body weight. Based on available information, a determination should be made whether or not a dedicated toxicology study of the combination is warranted.\n\nNonclinical Studies to Support Trials in Pediatric Populations (3.6)\n\nThe general paradigm for investigating most anticancer pharmaceuticals in pediatric patients is first to define a relatively safe dose in adult populations and then to assess some fraction of that dose in initial pediatric clinical studies. The recommendations for nonclinical testing outlined elsewhere in this document also apply for this population. Studies in juvenile animals are not usually conducted in order to support inclusion of pediatric populations for the treatment of cancer. Conduct of studies in juvenile animals should be considered only when human safety data and previous animal studies are considered insufficient for a safety evaluation in the intended pediatric age group.\n\nOther Considerations (4)\n\nConjugated Products (4.1)\n\nConjugated products are pharmaceuticals covalently bound to carrier molecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars. The safety of the conjugated material is the primary concern. The safety of the unconjugated material, including the linker used, can have a more limited evaluation. Stability of the conjugate in the test species and human plasma should be provided. A toxicokinetic evaluation should assess both the conjugated and the unconjugated compound after administration of the conjugated material.\n\nLiposomal Products (4.2)\n\nA complete evaluation of the liposomal product is not warranted if the unencapsulated material has been well characterized. As appropriate, the safety assessment should include a toxicological evaluation of the liposomal product and a limited evaluation of the unencapsulated pharmaceutical and carrier (e.g., a single arm in a toxicology study). The principle described here might also apply to other similar carriers. A toxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate. If possible, such an evaluation should assess both the liposomal product and the free compound after administration of the liposomal product.\n\nEvaluation of Drug Metabolites (4.3)\n\nIn some cases, metabolites that have been identified in humans have not been qualified in nonclinical studies. For these metabolites, a separate evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer.\n\nEvaluation of Impurities (4.4)\n\nIt is recognized that impurity standards have been based on a negligible risk, as discussed in ICH Q3A and Q3B. Exceeding the established limits for impurities identified in these ICH guidances could be appropriate for anticancer pharmaceuticals, and a justification should be provided in the marketing application. The justification could include the disease being treated and the patient population, the nature of the parent pharmaceutical (pharmacologic properties, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, etc.), duration of treatment, and the impact of impurity reduction on manufacturing. Further, the qualification assessment could include consideration of either the dose or concentration tested in nonclinical study relative to clinical levels. For genotoxic impurities, several approaches have been used to set limits based on increase in lifetime risk of cancer. Such limits are not appropriate for pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, and justifications described above should be considered to set higher limits. Impurities that are also metabolites present in animal and/or human studies are generally considered qualified.\n\nV Notes (5)\n\nFor nonrodent studies, dose groups usually consist of at least 3 animals/sex/group, with an additional 2/sex/group for recovery, if appropriate (see section II.D (2.4)). Both sexes should generally be used, or justification should be given for specific omissions.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.4164979457855225", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosafety Tests Using In Vivo Assays and Dermal Administration (3.5)\n\nThe main recommendations provided for investigating the systemic route of administration also apply to dermal administration, including those for species selection, study duration, and irradiation conditions. For dermal drug products in general, the clinical formulation should be tested. The intended clinical conditions of administration should be used to the extent possible. Irradiation of the exposed area should take place at a specified time after application, and the interval between application and irradiation should be justified based on the specific properties of the formulation to be tested. Signs of phototoxicity should be assessed based on relevant endpoints (see section III.D(3.4)). The sensitivity of the assay should be demonstrated using appropriate reference compounds. Assessment of systemic drug levels is generally not warranted in dermal phototoxicity studies.\n\nFor dermal drug products, contact photoallergy has often been assessed in a nonclinical study along with acute phototoxicity (photoirritation). However, no formal validation of such assays has been performed. Although the acute photoirritation observed in these studies is considered relevant to humans, the predictivity of these studies for human photoallergy is unknown. For regulatory purposes, such nonclinical photoallergy testing is generally not recommended.\n\nIV Clinical Photosafety Assessment (4)\n\nThere are various options for collecting human data, if warranted, ranging from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial. The precise strategy is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV Assessment Strategies (5)\n\nThe choice of the photosafety assessment strategy is up to the drug developer. ICH M3(R2) suggests that an initial assessment of the phototoxicity potential based on photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class be undertaken before outpatient studies. Characterization of the UV-visible absorption spectrum is recommended as the initial assessment because it can obviate any further photosafety evaluation. In addition, the distribution to skin and eye can be evaluated to inform further on the human risk and the recommendations for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation of phototoxicity potential (in vitro, in vivo, or clinical) should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nFigure 1 provides an outline of possible phototoxicity assessment strategies. The figure is based on the strategies outlined in this section of this guidance. The strategies are flexible. Depending on the particular situation, some portions of the assessment are optional and might not be conducted.\n\nRecommendations for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic Routes (5.1)\n\nv.1.1 Assessment of Phototoxicity Potential (5.1.1)\n\nIf the substance does not have an MEC greater than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 (between 290 and 700 nm), no photosafety testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans. However, it should be noted that phototoxicity by indirect mechanisms (e.g., pseudoporphyria or porphyia), although rare, could still occur. For compounds with MEC values of 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 or higher, if the drug developer chooses to conduct a test for photoreactivity, a negative result could support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section III.B(3.2)). Otherwise, nonclinical and/or clinical photosafety assessment of the substance should be conducted. Available data on the phototoxicity of chemical class-related compounds should be evaluated because this could inform on the approach to be taken.\n\nv.1.2 Evaluation of Phototoxicity (5.1.2)\n\nTo reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R principles, a validated in vitro method should generally be considered before conducting animal testing (see, for example, Directive 2010/63/EU). If the drug developer chooses an in vitro approach, the 3T3 NRU-PT is currently the most widely used assay and in many cases could be considered as an initial test for phototoxicity. The high sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT results in good negative predictivity and the negative results are generally accepted as sufficient evidence that a substance is not phototoxic. In such cases no further testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans.\n\nIn some situations (e.g., poorly soluble compounds), an initial assessment of phototoxicity in an in vitro assay might not be appropriate. In this case, an assessment in animals or in humans could be considered. Alternatively, if drug distribution data are available, they could, on a case-by-case basis, support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section II.B(2.2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome properties of the clinical formulation that could influence the potential phototoxic response (e.g., penetration into skin, intracellular uptake) cannot be evaluated using the 3T3 NRU-PT alone. Therefore, confirmation of the overall negative result in an evaluation using the clinical formulation and/or monitoring during clinical trials can still be warranted.\n\nReconstructed human skin models can be used to assess the phototoxicity potential of clinical formulations. Under adequate test conditions (see section III.C(3.3)), a negative result in a reconstructed human skin assay indicates that the direct phototoxicity potential of the formulation can be regarded as low. In this case, generally no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception).\n\nIf an appropriate in vitro assay is not available, the initial test could be an in vivo phototoxicity test on the clinical formulation. A negative result in an appropriately conducted in vivo animal phototoxicity study would be sufficient evidence that the formulation is not directly phototoxic and no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception). Alternatively, the phototoxicity potential can be assessed in the clinical setting.\n\nFor dermal products where the API or any new excipient has an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm, a photoullergy assessment is generally warranted in addition to phototoxicity testing. Because the predictivity of nonclinical photoullergy tests is unknown, this would typically be a clinical assessment using the to-be-marketed formulation and conducted during phase 3.\n\nPhotosafety evaluation of the clinical formulation delivered via dermal patches can follow the above described principles for clinical dermal formulations. For transdermal patches, the principles for both dermal and systemic drugs should be applied. In addition, the intended clinical use (e.g., skin area recommended for use, duration of application) and the properties of the patch matrix (e.g., being opaque to UV and visible light) should be considered for the overall risk assessment.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n\"otherwise\": data do not support a low potential for phototoxicity or have not been generated (assay/test/evaluation not conducted)\n\nA \"negative\" result in an appropriately conducted in vivo phototoxicity study supersedes a positive in vitro result. A robust clinical phototoxicity assessment indicating no concern supersedes any positive nonclinical results. A positive result in an in vitro phototoxicity test could also, on a case-by-case basis, be negated by tissue distribution data (see text). In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity on the to-be-marketed formulation can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nClinical evaluation could range from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial.\n\nTissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.259760856628418", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor either species, this design could be adapted to replace the corresponding standard chronic study and a separate juvenile animal study in some circumstances.\n\nThe appropriateness of carcinogenicity testing should be addressed before long-term exposure in pediatric clinical trials. However, unless there is a significant cause for concern (e.g., evidence of genotoxicity in multiple tests, or concern for pro-carcinogenic risk based on mechanistic considerations or findings from general toxicity studies), carcinogenicity studies are not recommended to support the conduct of pediatric clinical trials.\n\nXiii. Immunotoxicity (13)\n\nAs stated in the ICH S8 guidance (Ref. 14), all new human pharmaceuticals should be evaluated for the potential to produce immunotoxicity using standard toxicity studies and additional immunotoxicity studies conducted as appropriate based on a weight-of-evidence review, including immune-related signals from standard toxicity studies. If additional immunotoxicity studies are indicated, these should be completed before exposure of a large population of patients (e.g., phase 3).\n\nXiv. Photosafety Testing (14)\n\nThe appropriateness or timing of photosafety testing in relation to human exposure should be influenced by: (1) the photochemical properties (e.g., photoabsorption and photostability) of the molecule, (2) information on the phototoxic potential of chemically related compounds, (3) tissue distribution, and (4) clinical or nonclinical findings indicative of phototoxicity.\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on a drug's photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class should be performed. If assessment of all the available data and the proposed clinical plan indicates a potential for a significant human phototoxicity risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient clinical studies. In addition, a subsequent evaluation of the nonclinical drug distribution to skin and eye should be completed to inform further on the human risk and the need for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation (nonclinical, in vitro or in vivo, or clinical) of phototoxic potential should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nAlternatively, instead of the above stepwise approach, a direct assessment of phototoxic potential in a nonclinical or clinical study can be undertaken. If this study is negative, an early assessment of eye/skin distribution studies and clinical protective measures are not called for.\n\nIf the phototoxicity assessment indicates a potential photocarcinogenic risk, the risk can usually be adequately managed in patients by protective measures including a warning statement in the informed consent for clinical trials and in product information for marketing (Note 6).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor drugs that produce central nervous system activity, regardless of therapeutic indication, it should be considered whether or not an evaluation of abuse liability is warranted. Nonclinical studies should support the design of clinical evaluations of abuse potential, classification/scheduling by regulatory agencies, and product information. There are regional guidance documents on the conduct of nonclinical abuse liability assessment that can be helpful in designing specific abuse liability packages.\n\nNonclinical data collected early in the drug development process can be useful in identification of early indicators of abuse potential. These early indicators would typically be available before first human dose and include the PK/PD profile to identify the duration of action, similarity of chemical structure to known drugs of abuse, receptor binding profile, and behavioural/clinical signs from in vivo nonclinical studies. When no abuse potential is apparent from these early studies, extensive testing in nonclinical abuse liability models might not be warranted. Generally, if the active substance shows signals associated with known abuse liability patterns or the active substance has a novel mechanism of action on the central nervous system, further nonclinical studies are recommended to support large clinical trials (e.g., phase 3).\n\nWhen the metabolite profile and the target for drug activity in rodent are consistent with that of human, the nonclinical abuse liability evaluations should be conducted in rodents. Nonhuman primates should be reserved only for those limited cases where there is clear evidence that they would be predictive of human abuse liability and the rodent model is inadequate. Three types of studies are often completed to evaluate the potential for abuse liability: drug discrimination, self-administration of the compound, and an assessment of withdrawal. When conducted, studies of drug discrimination and self-administration are generally stand-alone. Assessments of withdrawal can sometimes be incorporated within the design of the reversibility arm of a repeated-dose toxicity study. A maximum dose that produces a plasma concentration several-fold higher than that obtained at the therapeutic clinical dose is considered appropriate for these nonclinical abuse assessments.\n\nOther Toxicity Studies (16)\n\nAdditional nonclinical studies (e.g., to identify potential biomarkers, to provide mechanistic understanding) can be useful if previous nonclinical or clinical findings with the product or related products have indicated special safety concerns.\n\nThe approaches for qualifying impurities and degradants are outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B (Refs. 12 and 13). If specific studies are warranted to qualify an impurity or degradant, generally these studies are not warranted before phase 3 unless there are changes that result in a significant new impurity profile (e.g., a new synthetic pathway, a new degradant formed by interactions between the components of the formulation). In these latter cases, appropriate qualification studies can be warranted to support phase 2 or later stages of development.\n\nCombination Drug Toxicity Testing (17)\n\nThis section covers combination drugs that are intended to be co-packaged or administered in a single dosage form (\"fixed formulation\"). The principles outlined can also apply whendeveloping products that will have product information recommendations for co-use with a specific drug, even if not in a fixed combination, and for which there is minimal clinical information regarding the combination.\n\nCombinations covered might involve: (1) two or more late stage entities (defined as compounds with significant clinical experience (i.e., from phase 3 studies and/ or post marketing))' (2) one or more late stage entity(ies) and one or more early stage entities (defined as compounds with limited clinical experience (i.e., phase 2 studies or less)); or (3) more than one early stage entity. For most combinations which involve two late stage entities and for which there is adequate clinical experience with co-administration, combination toxicity studies would generally not be recommended to support clinical studies or marketing unless there is significant toxicological concern (e.g., similar target organ toxicity). This concern would be modified depending on the margins of safety and the ability to monitor the adverse effects in humans. If a study is being conducted to address a cause for significant toxicological concern, it should generally be completed before carrying out clinical studies with the combination.\n\nWhere there are two late stage products for which there is not adequate clinical experience with co-administration, but there are no causes for significant toxicological concern based on the available data, nonclinical combination studies generally are not recommended to support small-scale, relatively short-duration clinical studies (e.g., phase 2 studies of up to 3 months' duration). Nonclinical combination studies, however, are recommended before large-scale or long-term combination trials, as well as for marketing.\n\nFor combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.352623462677002", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosensitization is a general term occasionally used to describe all light-induced tissue reactions. However, in order to clearly distinguish between photoallergy and phototoxicity, the term photosensitization is not used in this guidance.\n\nFor a chemical to demonstrate phototoxicity and/or photoallergy, the following characteristics are critical:\n\nabsorbs light within the range of natural sunlight (290-700 nm)\n\ngenerates a reactive species following absorption of UV-visible light\n\ndistributes sufficiently to light-exposed tissues (e.g., skin, eye)\n\nIf one or more of these conditions are not met, a compound will usually not present a concern for direct phototoxicity. However, increased sensitivity of skin to light can also occur through indirect mechanisms. Such mechanisms are not generally addressed by the testing outlined in this guidance (see also section II.D(2.4)).\n\nII Factors to Consider in the Photosafety Evaluation (2)\n\nPhotochemical Properties (2.1)\n\nThe initial consideration for assessment of photoreactive potential is whether a compound absorbs photons at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm. A compound that does not have a molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than 1000 L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm (Ref. [3]) is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity (see Note 3 for further details).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nexperience with melanin binding drugs suggests such binding alone does not present a photosafety concern.\n\nA single-dose tissue distribution study, with animals assessed at multiple timepoints after dosing, will generally provide an adequate assessment of relative tissue to plasma concentration ratios, tissue residence time, and the potential for retention and accumulation. Assessment timepoints should be appropriately spaced in such a study to account for the drug half-life.\n\nCompounds activated by visible light and exhibiting long elimination half-lives in internal tissues have been demonstrated to cause injury to those tissues if exposed to intense light during medical procedures. Consequently, for those compounds activated by visible light with potent in vivo phototoxicity or known to be phototoxic based on their mechanism of action, such as photodynamic therapy drugs, distribution to internal tissues should be measured and tissue-specific half-lives estimated. Drugs that only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light or have short tissue elimination half-lives are not likely to present a risk to internal tissues even if they are known to be photoreactive.\n\nMetabolite Considerations (2.3)\n\nMetabolites generally do not warrant separate photosafety assessments, because metabolism does not typically result in chromophores that are substantially different from those in the parent molecule.\n\nPharmacological Properties (2.4)\n\nIn many cases, drug-induced phototoxicity is due to the chemical structure and not the pharmacology. However, certain pharmacologic properties (e.g., immunosuppression, perturbation of heme homeostasis) can enhance susceptibility to light-induced effects, such as skin irritation or UV-induced skin tumor formation. The testing strategies outlined in this document are not designed to detect these types of indirect mechanisms. Some of these indirect mechanisms can be identified and evaluated in other nonclinical pharmacology/toxicity testing; however, phototoxicity related to other indirect mechanisms might only become apparent with human experience.\n\nIII Nonclinical Photosafety Tests (3)\n\nGeneral Considerations (3.1)\n\nCarefully selected conditions that consider both the model system and exposure to a relevant radiation spectrum are critical for nonclinical photosafety testing. Ideally, a nonclinical assay should exhibit both high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., low false negative and low false positive rates). However, to support the assessment strategies described in this document, it is most important that nonclinical photosafety assays show high sensitivity resulting in a low frequency of false negatives (i.e., a high negative predictive value). This is because negative assay results usually do not warrant further photosafety evaluation. The available nonclinical assays, both in vitro and in vivo, are focused primarily on detecting potential phototoxicity, which might or might not translate into clinically relevant phototoxicity.\n\nSelection of irradiation conditions is critical for both in vitro and in vivo assays. Natural sunlight represents the broadest range of light exposure that humans might be exposed to regularly. However, sunlight per se is not well defined and depends on many factors, such as latitude, altitude, season, time of day, and weather. In addition, sensitivity of human skin to natural sunlight depends on a number of individual factors (e.g., skin type, anatomical site and tanning status). Standardized sunlight exposure conditions have been defined by various organizations. Such standards (e.g., CIE-85-1989 (Ref. 5)) should be considered in order to assess suitability of a sunlight simulator light source, and irradiance and irradiation dose should be normalized based on the ultraviolet light A (UVA) part of the applied spectrum. UVA doses ranging from 5 to 20 J/cm({}^{2}) are successfully used in current in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. These UVA doses are comparable to those obtained during prolonged outdoor activities on summer days around noon time, in temperate zones, and at sea level. In humans, sunburn reactions caused by ultraviolet light B (UVB) normally limit total sunlight exposure. In nonclinical phototoxicity assays, however, the amount of UVB should not limit the overall irradiation and might be attenuated (partially filtered) so that relevant UVA doses can be tested without reducing assay sensitivity. Penetration of UVB light into human skin is mainly limited to the epidermis, while UVA can reach capillary blood. Therefore, clinical relevance of photochemical activation by UVB is considered less important than activation by UVA for systemic drugs. However, UVB irradiation is relevant for topical formulations applied to light-exposed tissues.\n\nThe selection and monitoring of appropriate light sources (spectral distribution, irradiance, and dose) and the procedures used should be clearly described in the study methodology (e.g., OECD TG 432 (Ref. 6)).\n\nPhotoreactivity Tests Using Chemical Assays (3.2)\n\nIf a drug developer chooses to assess photoreactivity, the assay should be qualified using pharmaceutical agents under appropriate conditions to demonstrate assay sensitivity. One such assay is an ROS assay (e.g., Ref. 7). Data suggest that this assay has high sensitivity for predicting direct in vivo phototoxicants. However, this assay has a low specificity, generating a high percentage of false positive results. A negative result in this assay, conducted under the appropriate conditions, would indicate a very low probability of phototoxicity, provided a test concentration of 200 (\\mu)M can be achieved, whereas a positive result (at any concentration) would only be a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nPhototoxicity Tests Using In Vitro Assays (3.3)\n\nA number of in vitro assays have been developed for assessing the phototoxicity potential of chemicals. Some of these assays have not been qualified for use with pharmaceuticals. Some assays involve testing compounds that are dissolved in the culture medium, and such methods are often appropriate for the active ingredient or excipients in drug products, depending on their solubility. Other assays involve direct application to the surface of a tissue preparation and can be appropriate for testing entire formulations intended to be administered topically.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe most widely used in vitro assay for phototoxicity is the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3T3 NRU-PT) for which an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline (Ref. 6) is available. This is currently considered the most appropriate in vitro screen for soluble compounds.\n\nAlthough the formal European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) validation exercise conducted on this assay indicated a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 84%, experience within the pharmaceutical industry suggests a much lower specificity. The original OECD protocol was not validated for pharmaceuticals specifically. Thus, some modifications to the original OECD protocol have been proposed to address the low specificity observed with drug substances (see Note 4). These proposed changes are appropriate for the testing of pharmaceuticals. The sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT is high, and if a compound is negative in this assay, it would have a very low probability of being phototoxic in humans. However, a positive result in the 3T3 NRU-PT should not be regarded as indicative of a likely clinical phototoxic risk, but rather a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nThe BALB/c 3T3 cell line is sensitive to UVB, and the initially recommended irradiation conditions (Ref. 6) involve the use of filters to attenuate wavelengths below 320 nm. However, depending on the light source and filters used, the ratio of UVB to UVA can be adjusted such that it is possible to assess UVB-induced phototoxicity in this test. UVB-induced phototoxicity is rarely a problem for pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure because UVB minimally penetrates beyond the epidermis. However, UVB-induced phototoxicity is more relevant for topical products. For components of topically applied products that absorb predominately in the UVB range, and if in vitro assessment is desired, the use of the 3T3 NRU-PT with modified irradiation conditions (see above) can be considered. Alternatively, in vitro skin models, which better tolerate UVB, could be considered.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.44945210218429565", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not apply to pharmaceuticals intended for cancer prevention, treatment of symptoms or side effects of chemotherapeutics, studies in healthy volunteers, vaccines, or cellular or gene therapy. If healthy volunteers are included in clinical trials, the ICH M3 guidance should be followed. Radiopharmaceuticals are not covered in this guidance, but some of the principles could be adapted.\n\nGeneral Principles (4)\n\nThe development of each new pharmaceutical calls for studies designed to characterize its pharmacological and toxicological properties according to its intended use in humans.\n\nModification of \"standard\" nonclinical testing protocols generally is warranted to address novel characteristics associated with the pharmaceutical or with the manner in which it is to be used in humans.\n\nThe manufacturing process can change during the course of development. However, the active pharmaceutical substance used in nonclinical studies should be well characterized and should adequately represent the active substance to be used in the clinical trials.\n\nIn general, nonclinical safety studies that are used to support the development of a pharmaceutical should be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices.\n\nII Studies to Support Nonclinical Evaluation (2)\n\nPharmacology (1)\n\nPrior to Phase 1 studies, preliminary characterization of the mechanism(s) of action and schedule dependencies, as well as anti-tumor activity of the pharmaceutical, should have been made. Appropriate models should be selected based on the target and mechanism of action, but the pharmaceutical need not be studied using the same tumor types intended for clinical evaluation.\n\nThese studies can:\n\nprovide nonclinical proof of principle;\n\nguide schedules and dose-escalation schemes;\n\nprovide information for selection of test species;\n\naid in start dose selection and selection of investigational biomarkers, where appropriate; and,\n\nif relevant, justify pharmaceutical combinations.\n\nUnderstanding the secondary pharmacodynamic properties of a pharmaceutical could contribute to the assessment of safety for humans, and those properties might be investigated as appropriate.\n\nSafety Pharmacology (2)\n\nAn assessment of the pharmaceutical's effect on vital organ functions (including cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems) should be available before the initiation of clinical studies; such parameters could be included in general toxicology studies. Detailed clinical observations following dosing and appropriate electrocardiographic measurements in nonrodents are generally considered sufficient. Conducting stand-alone safety pharmacology studies to support studies in patients with advanced cancer is not called for. In cases where specific concerns have been identified that could put patients at significant additional risks in clinical trials, appropriate safety pharmacology studies described in ICH S7A and/or S7B should be considered. In the absence of a specific risk, such studies will not be called for to support clinical trials or for marketing.\n\nPharmacokinetics (2.3)\n\nThe evaluation of limited pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., peak plasma/serum levels, area under the curve (AUC), and half-life) in the animal species used for nonclinical studies can facilitate dose selection, schedule, and escalation during Phase 1 studies. Further information on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the pharmaceutical in animals should normally be generated in parallel with clinical development.\n\nGeneral Toxicology (2.4)\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer is to assess the safety of the pharmaceutical. Phase 1 assessments can include dosing to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicology studies to determine a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or no effect level (NOEL) are not considered essential to support clinical use of an anticancer pharmaceutical. As the toxicity of the pharmaceutical can be greatly influenced by its schedule of administration, an approximation of its clinical schedule should be evaluated in toxicology studies. This is further discussed in sections III.C and III.D (3.3 and 3.4).\n\nAssessment of the potential to recover from toxicity should be provided to understand whether serious adverse effects are reversible or irreversible. A study that includes a terminal nondosing period is called for if there is severe toxicity at approximate clinical exposure and recovery cannot be predicted by scientific assessment. This scientific assessment can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion and the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect. If a study of recovery is called for, it should be available to support clinical development. The demonstration of complete recovery is not considered essential.\n\nFor small molecules, the general toxicology testing usually includes rodents and nonrodents. In certain circumstances, determined case-by-case, alternative approaches can be appropriate (e.g., for genotoxic drugs targeting rapidly dividing cells, a repeat-dose toxicity study in one rodent species might be considered sufficient, provided the rodent is a relevant species). For biopharmaceuticals, see ICH S6 for the number of species to be studied.\n\nToxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate.\n\nReproduction Toxicology (2.5)\n\nAn embryofetal toxicology assessment is conducted to communicate potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are or might become pregnant. Embryofetal toxicity studies of anticancer pharmaceuticals should be available when the marketing application is submitted, but these studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. These studies are also not considered essential for the purpose of marketing applications for pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow) in general toxicity studies or belong to a class that has been well characterized as causing developmental toxicity.\n\nFor small molecules, embryofetal toxicology studies are typically conducted in two species as described by ICH S5(R2). In cases where an embryofetal developmental toxicity study is positive for embryofetal lethality or teratogenicity, a confirmatory study in a second species is usually not warranted.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticales, an assessment in one pharmacologically relevant species should usually be sufficient. This assessment might be done by evaluating the toxicity during the period of organogenesis or study designs as described by ICH S6. Alternative approaches might be considered appropriate if scientifically justified. The alternative approaches might include a literature assessment, assessment of placental transfer, the direct or indirect effects of the biopharmaceutical, or other factors.\n\nA study of fertility and early embryonic development is not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Information available from general toxicology studies on the pharmaceutical's effect on reproductive organs should be used as the basis of the assessment of impairment of fertility.\n\nA pre- and postnatal toxicology study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.\n\nF. Genotoxicity (2.6)\n\nGenotoxicity studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. Genotoxicity studies should be performed to support marketing (see ICH S2). The principles outlined in ICH S6 should be followed for biopharmaceuticales. If the in vitro assays are positive, an in vivo assay might not be warranted.\n\nG. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.46926236152648926", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: See the appendix for additional information.\n\nWhen a delivery or mixing device is used, sponsors should describe the drug-delivery device and reference an approved or cleared device or device application. Sponsors should also ensure that the performance characteristics of the syringe are maintained throughout the shelf life. Sponsors should consider in-use testing.\n\nNonclinical Development\n\nNonclinical development of anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in the following guidance documents:\n\nICH guidance for industry S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals (March 2010) (ICH S9)\n\nICH guidance for industry S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals: Questions and Answers (June 2018)\n\nICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (May 2012) (ICH S6(R1))\n\nGuidance for industry Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations (May 2019)\n\nSponsors should include pharmacology studies supporting the proposed trial with the initial IND. It is important for sponsors to test the formulation in an animal model for dose finding and chemistry and manufacturing consistency before initiating clinical trials.5 In general, sponsors should provide nonclinical, general toxicology studies in rodents and nonrodents of up to 1 month's duration to support early clinical development, and they should provide studies of 3 months' duration to support pivotal registration trials. Safety pharmacology and toxicokinetic endpoints can be included in these studies rather than using stand-alone studies. The general toxicology studies should use a route of administration similar to the route of administration in the intended clinical trial and should follow the recommendations described in Table 1 of ICH S9. Consistent with ICH S6(R1), if the 1-month studies show a consistent toxicological profile, then a 3-month study in a single species may be sufficient. Because GnRH analogues are peptides with expected high specificity, secondary pharmacology studies are usually not warranted.\n\nFootnote 5: We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) for animal use in testing when feasible. FDA encourages sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering a nonanimal testing method believed to be suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. FDA will consider if the alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nConsistent with the FDA guidance on reproductive testing for oncology pharmaceuticals, no embryo-fetal toxicology study or other reproductive toxicology study is needed to support the indication of advanced prostate cancer (see ICH S9, ICH S6(R1), and guidance for industry Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations). Unless there are unnatural amino acids (i.e., amino acids not normally found in mammals) in the GnRH product, the sponsor does not need to evaluate genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.\n\nIn general, it is not necessary to evaluate phototoxicity or immunotoxicity to support developing or marketing GnRH analogues to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nRegistrational Trial Considerations\n\n3.3.1 Trial Design\n\nSingle-arm trials using T levels as pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers are conducted to support the approval of GnRH analogues. These trials should demonstrate the following:\n\nAttainment of a castrate (less than 50 nanogram (ng)/deciliter (dL)) T level\n\nMaintenance of castrate T levels until the end of a dosing interval\n\nMaintenance of castrate T levels immediately after subsequent doses of the study drug product\n\nTo demonstrate these effects of the study drug product on T levels, the treatment period should be at least twice as long as the dosing interval. For drug products that act over a relatively short period (e.g., 1 month), the treatment period should extend over several (three to four) dosing intervals.\n\nSponsors should discuss with the division randomized designs intended to support comparative claims (efficacy and/or safety) among GnRH analogues.\n\n3.3.2 Trial Population\n\nParticipants enrolled in trials intended to support an indication for treating advanced prostate cancer should have normal T levels and either metastatic or biochemically recurrent disease. Sponsors could consider excluding participants with bone metastases in weight-bearing bone who are at risk for developing symptoms associated with T flare. We recommend that sponsors record information concerning the participant's history of prostate cancer, including the date of diagnosis, current stage, extent of metastatic disease at baseline, and prior therapies.\n\n3.3.3 Dose Selection\n\nThe study drug product dose used in the clinical trial should be informed by nonclinical testing. Sponsors should consider using early dose-finding studies or enrolling participants at multiple dose levels in the registrational trial. The adequacy of data for the selected dose for the new drug product will be assessed based on one or more clinical trials that demonstrate an adequate bridge to support the ability to rely on the safety and effectiveness of the listed drug for the new drug product.\n\n3.3.4 Trial Procedures and Timing of Assessments\n\nGnRH agonists are expected to achieve castrate T levels by Day 28, and T levels should be measured at this time. GnRH antagonists are expected to achieve more rapid development of castrate T levels than GnRH agonists. To document when castrate T levels occur, sponsors should consider weekly assessment of T levels until Day 28. Although the final analyses shoulduse T levels assessed at a central laboratory, T levels should also be assessed at local laboratories so that participants who do not have castrate T levels (on or after Day 28) can be promptly removed from the trial for safety reasons.\n\nTo ensure that castrate T levels are maintained over the dosing interval, sponsors developing GnRH agonists or antagonists should measure T levels before each dose of the study drug product. Sponsors could consider additional measurement of T levels at other time points, including the midpoint of the dosing interval, to help guide further drug product development if the predose level fails to show castrate T levels.\n\nTo assess for potential T surges following subsequent doses of a GnRH agonist, sponsors should obtain T levels at 1 hour, 4 hours, and 3 days after subsequent doses in all trial participants and provide these results as supportive efficacy data. Sponsors could consider an additional T measurement between 3 and 7 days after the additional dose. Sponsors should justify and discuss the appropriateness of the timing of T-level assessments with FDA before initiating the study.\n\nWe recommend that sponsors assess the effect of the study drug product on tumors by measuring prostate specific antigen at a central laboratory and reviewing bone scans and scans of known sites of disease (e.g., computed tomography (CT) scans). For participants with metastatic disease, tumor measurements would normally be obtained every 3 to 6 months during the treatment period, and we recommend that these results be included in the application database.\n\nSponsors should collect information on the dates of use and dose of herbal medications and dietary supplements, if they were used, at trial entry and throughout the treatment period because some herbal or alternative medications may affect T levels. Sponsors should also provide participants with a list of medications that they should not use during the trial period.\n\nAdverse event collection should solicit events using open-ended questions and known adverse events for this class of drugs, such as hot flushes, breast pain, bone pain, difficulty sleeping, and injection site reactions. After collecting data on injection site reactions, sponsors should report all terms related to this concept (e.g., injection site swelling, redness, pain) under a single term. The incidence of injection site reactions has varied markedly between trials, and this may be related to a lack of uniformity in ascertainment and assessment. Sponsors should assess adverse events throughout the treatment period and for 30 days after the end of the dosing interval. For example, sponsors should assess adverse events for 4 months after the last dose of a 3-month formulation of a GnRH analogue.\n\nSafety monitoring should include measurement of hemoglobin A1C and a lipid panel at screening and at the end of treatment, at minimum. Multiple trials have demonstrated an association between GnRH agonist use and adverse effects on insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.6 If the treatment period exceeds 1 year, these tests should be repeated annually. If the treatment period exceeds 2 years, bone density should also be measured at baseline and every 2 years.\n\nBefore trial initiation, sponsors should discuss with the division the potential use of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) to support labeling claims.7\n\nFootnote 7: See the guidance for industry Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims(December 2009) and the draft guidance for industry Core Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cancer Clinical Trials(June 2021).

A detailed graphical presentation (e.g., flow chart, diagram, or drawing) will be helpful to orient the FDA review staff. The overview should be sufficiently clear to identify all the steps of the process related to cleaning, disinfection and/or sterilization, and functional performance of the device.\n\nState the maximum number of times the device is intended to be reprocessed, the incoming raw material (processed OEM device) specifications, and the design specifications for the finished device.\n\nProvide a risk analysis, as discussed in Question 13.\n\nProvide the process specifications, operating conditions, and acceptance criteria for the product and process, as discussed in Question 13.\n\nInclude in the validation report(s) the procedures and protocols utilized in the validation efforts, results, and other supporting information. The reports should summarize this information, and the appendices should include expanded information and/or the complete information referenced in the reports. Manufacturers may contact FDA to discuss the content of their reports before submitting this information to FDA.\n\nCleaning\n\nThe manufacturer should provide a thorough summary of data and information on the cleaning portion of the design and process validation. A number of formats for this information may be suitable. One format, using the following headings, is based on a process design and validation scheme adapted from ISO 14937, \"Sterilization of medical devices - General requirements for characterization of a sterilizing agent and the development, validation and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices:\"\n\nCleaning Agent Characterization\n\nProcess and Equipment Characterization\n\nProduct Definition\n\nProcess Definition\n\nProcess Validation, which includes:\n\nInstallation Qualification\n\nOperational Qualification\n\nPerformance Qualification\n\nRoutine Monitoring and Control\n\nProduct Release\n\nAssessment of Change\n\nCleaning Agent Characterization\n\nThe submission should:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecify all the cleaning agents used, including products such as enzymes, water, rinses and detergents.\n\nDescribe why each of the products was selected, and how the agents are prepared, used, and stored. Documentation of the labeling for the agents for conditions of use is acceptable.\n\nDocument any deviation from the labeled conditions.\n\nProvide summary data on the safety of the cleaning agents under their conditions of use, specifically in regard to their toxic levels. This can be derived from Material Safety Data Sheets and/or from toxicological tests.\n\nDocument the cleaning test methods, acceptance criteria, analysis and test results. The results should demonstrate the effectiveness of the cleaning agents when used as labeled or as intended by the reprocessor.\n\nDocument all potential worst case degrees and type of contamination, as applicable, such as blood and other body fluids, fecal material, tissues, lubricants, and residual cleaning agents. The methods and results should document effectiveness of the agents on the specific device under the worst case contamination conditions.\n\nDescribe the cleaning endpoint used in the tests and the rationale for the endpoint.\n\nDescribe the sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, accuracy, and precision (as applicable) of the analytical test methods for determining that the endpoint is achieved, (i.e., the device is clean).\n\nDescribe the statistical considerations for the tests and explain how the samples used in testing represent the range of types of devices in the 510(k) submission.\n\nNote: Tests demonstrating a reduction in contamination levels alone are insufficient as an endpoint. Although the common definition of a clean device is one that is visually free of contamination, this condition should be translated by the reprocessor into an objective and measurable endpoint specification. The endpoint should have a visual component but should be supplemented with chemical, microbiological, and/or other physical parameters with tolerances. Devices should not have an endpoint based on visual examination alone.\n\nTests should demonstrate that the cleaning endpoint is achieved independently of subsequent process steps. Test methods may utilize simulations of contamination under controlled lab conditions; however, actual contamination should be used to complete validation testing.\n\nProcess and Equipment Characterization\n\nThe submission should:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDescribe the cleaning process parameters and their tolerances. These parameters include all the variables of the process such as soak and rinsing amounts, process times, temperatures, brushing duration, and ultrasound bath parameters. The submission should describe how these process variables are controlled and monitored.\n\nInclude quality control tests.\n\nDescribe the specifications for the cleaning equipment, including, for example, physical description, instrumentation for monitoring and controlling the process, and fault recognition.\n\n4.2.3 Product Definition\n\nThe submission should:\n\nDefine the product to be cleaned and how it is presented for cleaning. This includes the acceptable degree of microbiological, organic and inorganic contamination of the device.\n\nDescribe any steps in the cleaning process that have limits on the degree of incoming contamination. For example, initial defined steps of wiping, rinsing, and an enzyme soak may be needed to remove gross contamination prior to additional steps at the site of reprocessing.\n\n4.2.4 Process Definition\n\nThe submission should:\n\nProvide a thorough summary of the specifications of the process and summarize the process definition activities. This includes information to demonstrate that the cleaning process attains the process parameters by objective endpoints. The biological safety of the product following exposure to the cleaning agents and after removal of residuals can be deferred to the sterilization validation step, if needed, since the end product of the entire process should be assessed.\n\nIdentify and document, in the risk assessment, the limits for process residuals. The means to reduce the residuals should be documented.\n\nDemonstrate that the cleaned device meets the acceptance criteria.\n\nSpecify the process used to determine the number of times each device has been reprocessed.\n\nDescribe any procedures associated with repairing, refurbishing and/or replacing any device component as part of the reprocessing procedure. Characterize the replacement components and assess their suitability by appropriate engineering tests, and by preclinical or clinical tests when engineering tests alone are insufficient to assess clinical safety and effectiveness. Data regarding these activities should be provided.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNote: The functional performance assessment should be deferred until after the sterilization validation step, if sterilization is required. However, the effectiveness and safety of cleaning as a separate process should be individually documented. In other words, the manufacturer should show that the cleaning step results in a device that meets the cleaning endpoint and then show that the sterilization process achieves sterilization given worst case preprocess bioburden specifications (e.g., process achieves a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10-6 with overkill).\n\nProcess Validation\n\nThe purpose of process validation is explained above. There are three steps used in process validation that can be adapted to a cleaning process, including both equipment and manual procedures. These steps are installation qualification, operational qualification, and performance qualification. The submission should provide a summary of each of the process validation steps as they apply to the reprocessing of the specific device:\n\nThe installation qualification can be briefly summarized. For purposes of a 510(k), FDA is primarily interested in a summary of the operational and performance qualification where test and actual loads or sample runs are evaluated.\n\nThe operational qualification summary data should demonstrate that the cleaning equipment is capable of delivering the specified process within defined tolerances.\n\nThe performance qualification summary should demonstrate that multiple consecutive runs of the cleaning process with the specific type of device achieve the specified outcome. Explain any failures of the process and means to correct the process. The qualification should demonstrate effective and safe reprocessing after the defined number of iterations specified by the reprocessor.\n\nRoutine Monitoring and Control\n\nThe submission should describe how the cleaning process is monitored and controlled on a routine basis.\n\nProduct Release\n\nThe submission should provide the procedures for product release for return to the user or for further reprocessing, (e.g., packaging and terminal sterilization). This includes the criteria for designating the cleaning process as conforming to its endpoint specifications.\n\nAssessment of Change\n\nThe submission should describe how changes to the incoming device will be assessed to identify significant changes that may impact the effectiveness of cleaning. (See also Question 13.)\n\nPackaging\n\nA manufacturer of a reprocessed SUD is not required to submit packaging validation data. However, any 510(k) premarket notification should contain a full description of the final packaging materials, packaging configuration, and shelf life. We recommend you retain the packaging validation protocol and data, and shelf life data on file at the manufacturing facility for review during a Quality Systems audit.\n\nSterilization\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Validation Data in Premarket Notification Submissions (510(k)s) for Reprocessed Single-Use Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.879896402359009", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: 14.20 Introducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a crystallization step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g., distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. However, if such reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included as part of the standard manufacturing process.\n14.21 Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. This is not considered to be reprocessing.\n14.22 Introducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality of the intermediate or API is not adversely impacted due to the potential formation of by-products and over-reacted materials.\n14.3 Reworking\n14.30 Before a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for non-conformance should be performed.\n14.31 Batches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. Concurrent validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework procedures. This allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be carried out, and the expected results. If there is only one batch to be reworked, then a report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable.\n14.32 Procedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process. Where routine analytical methods are inadequate to characterize the reworked batch, additional methods should be used.\n14.4 Recovery of Materials and Solvents\n14.40 Recovery (e.g. from mother liquor or filtrates) of reactants, intermediates, or the API is considered acceptable, provided that approved procedures exist for the recovery and the recovered materials meet specifications suitable for their intended use.\n14.41 Solvents can be recovered and reused in the same processes or in different processes, provided that the recovery procedures are controlled and monitored to ensure that solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse or co-mingling with other approved materials.\n14.42 Fresh and recovered solvents and reagents can be combined if adequate testing has shown their suitability for all manufacturing processes in which they may be used.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.467384338378906", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: 8.17 Materials to be reprocessed or reworked should be appropriately controlled to prevent unauthorized use.\n\n8.2 Time Limits\n\n8.20 If time limits are specified in the master production instruction (see 6.41), these time limits should be met to ensure the quality of intermediates and APIs. Deviations should be documented and evaluated. Time limits may be inappropriate when processing to a target value (e.g., pH adjustment, hydrogenation, drying to predetermined specification) because completion of reactions or processing steps are determined by in-process sampling and testing.\n\n8.21 Intermediates held for further processing should be stored under appropriate conditions to ensure their suitability for use.\n\nIn-process Sampling and Controls\n\n8.30 Written procedures should be established to monitor the progress and control the performance of processing steps that cause variability in the quality characteristics of intermediates and APIs. In-process controls and their acceptance criteria shouldbe defined based on the information gained during the development stage or historical data.\n\n8.31 The acceptance criteria and type and extent of testing can depend on the nature of the intermediate or API being manufactured, the reaction or process step being conducted, and the degree to which the process introduces variability in the product's quality. Less stringent in-process controls may be appropriate in early processing steps, whereas tighter controls may be appropriate for later processing steps (e.g., isolation and purification steps).\n\n8.32 Critical in-process controls (and critical process monitoring), including the control points and methods, should be stated in writing and approved by the quality unit(s).\n\n8.33 In-process controls can be performed by qualified production department personnel and the process adjusted without prior quality unit(s) approval if the adjustments are made within pre-established limits approved by the quality unit(s). All tests and results should be fully documented as part of the batch record.\n\n8.34 Written procedures should describe the sampling methods for in-process materials, intermediates, and APIs. Sampling plans and procedures should be based on scientifically sound sampling practices.\n\n8.35 In-process sampling should be conducted using procedures designed to prevent contamination of the sampled material and other intermediates or APIs. Procedures should be established to ensure the integrity of samples after collection.\n\n8.36 Out-of-specification (OOS) investigations are not normally needed for in-process tests that are performed for the purpose of monitoring and/or adjusting the process.\n\n8.4 Blending Batches of Intermediates or APIs\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.129388332366943", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Good process design and development should anticipate significant sources of variability and establish appropriate detection, control, and/or mitigation strategies, as well as appropriate alert and action limits. However, a process is likely to encounter sources of variation that were not previously detected or to which the process was not previously exposed. Many tools and techniques, some statistical and others more qualitative, can be used to detect variation, characterize it, and determine the root cause. We recommend that the manufacturer use quantitative, statistical methods whenever appropriate and feasible. Scrutiny of intra-batch as well as inter-batch variation is part of a comprehensive continued process verification program under SS 211.180(e).\n\nWe recommend continued monitoring and sampling of process parameters and quality attributes at the level established during the process qualification stage until sufficient data are available to generate significant variability estimates. These estimates can provide the basis for establishing levels and frequency of routine sampling and monitoring for the particular product and process. Monitoring can then be adjusted to a statistically appropriate and representative level. Process variability should be periodically assessed and monitoring adjusted accordingly.\n\nVariation can also be detected by the timely assessment of defect complaints, out-of-specification findings, process deviation reports, process yield variations, batch records, incoming raw material records, and adverse event reports. Production line operators and quality unit staff should be encouraged to provide feedback on process performance. We recommend that the quality unit meet periodically with production staff to evaluate data, discuss possible trends or undesirable process variation, and coordinate any correction or follow-up actions by production.\n\nData gathered during this stage might suggest ways to improve and/or optimize the process by altering some aspect of the process or product, such as the operating conditions (ranges and set-points), process controls, component, or in-process material characteristics. A description of the planned change, a well-justified rationale for the change, an implementation plan, and quality unit approval before implementation must be documented (SS 211.100). Depending on how the proposed change might affect product quality, additional process design and process qualification activities could be warranted.19\n\nFootnote 19: Certain manufacturing changes may call for formal notification to the Agency before implementation, as directed by existing regulations (see, e.g., 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12).\n\nMaintenance of the facility, utilities, and equipment is another important aspect of ensuring that a process remains in control. Once established, qualification status must be maintained through routine monitoring, maintenance, and calibration procedures and schedules (21 CFR part 211,subparts C and D). The equipment and facility qualification data should be assessed periodically to determine whether re-qualification should be performed and the extent of that re-qualification. Maintenance and calibration frequency should be adjusted based on feedback from these activities.\n\nV Concurrent release of PPQ batches\n\nIn most cases, the PPQ study needs to be completed successfully and a high degree of assurance in the process achieved before commercial distribution of a product. In special situations, the PPQ protocol can be designed to release a PPQ batch for distribution before complete execution of the protocol steps and activities, i.e., concurrent release. FDA expects that concurrent release will be used rarely.\n\nConcurrent release might be appropriate for processes used infrequently for various reasons, such as to manufacture drugs for which there is limited demand (e.g., orphan drugs, minor use and minor species veterinary drugs) or which have short half lives (e.g., radiopharmaceutical, including positron emission tomography drugs). Concurrent release might also be appropriate for drugs that are medically necessary and are being manufactured in coordination with the Agency to alleviate a short supply.\n\nConclusions about a commercial manufacturing process can only be made after the PPQ protocol is fully executed and the data are fully evaluated. If Stage 2 qualification is not successful (i.e., does not demonstrate that the process as designed is capable of reproducible performance at commercial scale), then additional design studies and qualification may be necessary. The new product and process understanding obtained from the unsuccessful qualification study(ies) can have negative implications if any lot was already distributed. Full execution of Stages 1 and 2 of process validation is intended to preclude or minimize that outcome.\n\nCircumstances and rationale for concurrent release should be fully described in the PPQ protocol. Even when process performance assessment based on the PPQ protocol is still outstanding, any lot released concurrently must comply with all CGMPs, regulatory approval requirements, and PPQ protocol lot release criteria. Lot release under a PPQ protocol is based upon meeting confidence levels appropriate for each quality attribute of the drug.\n\nWhen warranted and used, concurrent release should be accompanied by a system for careful oversight of the distributed batch to facilitate rapid customer feedback. For example, customer complaints and defect reports should be rapidly assessed to determine root cause and whether the process should be improved or changed. Concurrently released lots must also be assessed in light of any negative PPQ study finding or conclusions and appropriate corrective action must be taken (SSSS 211.100(a), 211.180(e), and 211.192). We recommend that each batch in a concurrent release program be evaluated for inclusion in the stability program. It is important that stability test data be promptly evaluated to ensure rapid detection and correction of any problems.\n\nVI Documentation\n\nDocumentation at each stage of the process validation lifecycle is essential for effective communication in complex, lengthy, and multidisciplinary projects. Documentation is important so that knowledge gained about a product and process is accessible and comprehensible to others involved in each stage of the lifecycle. Information transparency and accessibility are fundamental tenets of the scientific method. They are also essential to enabling organizational units responsible and accountable for the process to make informed, science-based decisions that ultimately support the release of a product to commerce.\n\nThe degree and type of documentation required by CGMP vary during the validation lifecycle. Documentation requirements are greatest during Stage 2, process qualification, and Stage 3, continued process verification. Studies during these stages must conform to CGMPs and must be approved by the quality unit in accordance with the regulations (see SSSS 211.22 and 211.100). Viral and impurity clearance studies, even when performed at small scale, also require quality unit oversight.\n\nCGMP documents for commercial manufacturing (i.e., the initial commercial master batch production and control record (SS 211.186) and supporting procedures) are key outputs of Stage 1, process design. We recommend that firms diagram the process flow for the full-scale process. Process flow diagrams should describe each unit operation, its placement in the overall process, monitoring and control points, and the component, as well as other processing material inputs (e.g., processing aids) and expected outputs (i.e., in-process materials and finished product). It is also useful to generate and preserve process flow diagrams of the various scales as the process design progresses to facilitate comparison and decision making about their comparability.\n\nVII Analytical Methodology\n\nProcess knowledge depends on accurate and precise measuring techniques used to test and examine the quality of drug components, in-process materials, and finished products. Validated analytical methods are not necessarily required during product- and process-development activities or when used in characterization studies. Nevertheless, analytical methods should be scientifically sound (e.g., specific, sensitive, and accurate) and provide results that are reliable. There should be assurance of proper equipment function for laboratory experiments. Procedures for analytical method and equipment maintenance, documentation practices, and calibration practices supporting process-development efforts should be documented or described. New analytical technology and modifications to existing technology are continually being developed and can be used to characterize the process or the product. Use of these methods is particularly appropriate when they reduce risk by providing greater understanding or control of product quality. However, analytical methods supporting commercial batch release must follow CGMPs in parts 210 and 211. Clinical supply production should follow the CGMPs appropriate for the particular phase of clinical studies.\n\nGlossary\n\nCapability of a process:\n\nAbility of a process to produce a product that will fulfill the requirements of that product. The concept of process capability can also be defined in statistical terms. (ISO 9000:2005)\n\nCommercial manufacturing process:\n\nThe manufacturing process resulting in commercial product (i.e., drug that is marketed, distributed, and sold or intended to be sold). For the purposes of this guidance, the term commercial manufacturing process does not include clinical trial or treatment IND material.\n\nConcurrent release:\n--------------------\nContext title: Process Validation- General Principles and Practices Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.328124046325684", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: The installation qualification can be briefly summarized. For purposes of a 510(k), FDA is primarily interested in a summary of the operational and performance qualification where test and actual loads or sample runs are evaluated.\n\nThe operational qualification summary data should demonstrate that the cleaning equipment is capable of delivering the specified process within defined tolerances.\n\nThe performance qualification summary should demonstrate that multiple consecutive runs of the cleaning process with the specific type of device achieve the specified outcome. Explain any failures of the process and means to correct the process. The qualification should demonstrate effective and safe reprocessing after the defined number of iterations specified by the reprocessor.\n\nRoutine Monitoring and Control\n\nThe submission should describe how the cleaning process is monitored and controlled on a routine basis.\n\nProduct Release\n\nThe submission should provide the procedures for product release for return to the user or for further reprocessing, (e.g., packaging and terminal sterilization). This includes the criteria for designating the cleaning process as conforming to its endpoint specifications.\n\nAssessment of Change\n\nThe submission should describe how changes to the incoming device will be assessed to identify significant changes that may impact the effectiveness of cleaning. (See also Question 13.)\n\nPackaging\n\nA manufacturer of a reprocessed SUD is not required to submit packaging validation data. However, any 510(k) premarket notification should contain a full description of the final packaging materials, packaging configuration, and shelf life. We recommend you retain the packaging validation protocol and data, and shelf life data on file at the manufacturing facility for review during a Quality Systems audit.\n\nSterilization\n\nThe submission should include a summary of the sterilization process design and validation activities. As explained above, the ISO 14937 scheme may serve as a template for this documentation. FDA does not believe that reiteration of the provisions of these standards is necessary for purposes of this guidance. They can be accessed at various websites for the standards development organizations.\n\nPyrogen Tests\n\nDevices that come into direct or indirect contact with blood should be assessed for residual pyrogens after the sterilization process. FDA-recognized standards should be referenced when possible. A summary of the tests conducted during process definition should be described as well as routine monitoring.\n\nFunctional Performance\n\nA reprocessor must evaluate functional performance of its reprocessed device(s) according to MDUFMA section 302 (the Act SS 510(o)(1)(A), (2)(A)). Functional performance is a component of sterilization process characterization and validation, and also of cleaning process validation.\n\nThe reprocessor should assess functional performance on a worst case basis, i.e., after the maximum number of times the device is intended to be reprocessed as specified by the reprocessor. The reprocessor should simulate use of each sample of device between each reprocessing cycle and this step should be specified in the summary of the process design and validation. The specific types of engineering and other tests to be conducted will vary depending on the specific device.\n\nThe device should continue to meet its performance specifications after the reprocessor has tested the maximum number of intended cycles. Current FDA device-specific guidance may include performance tests that the reprocessor may use in validating functional performance. The performance tests should be summarized in the process design and validation documentation submitted for review.\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Validation Data in Premarket Notification Submissions (510(k)s) for Reprocessed Single-Use Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.633347988128662"], "Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain contracts specify that a series of nonclinical laboratory studies be done on a single test article.

The actual studies are then subcontracted to nonclinical laboratories. Is the firm considered to be a \"sponsor?\"\n\nThe GLPs define \"sponsor\" as a person who initiates and supports a nonclinical laboratory study. Sponsorship in the cited example would be determined by the specific provisions of the contract.\n\nWho is responsible for test article characterization - the sponsor or the contractor?\n\nThe GLPs do not assign the responsibility in this area. The matter is a subject of the specific contractual arrangement between the sponsor and the contractor.\n\nDo contract laboratories have to show the sponsor's name on the Master Schedule Sheet or can this information be coded?\n\nThe information can be coded but the code must be revealed to the FDA investigator on request.\n\nA sponsor desires to contract for a nonclinical laboratory study to be conducted in a foreign laboratory. Must the sponsor notify the foreign laboratory that compliance with the U.S. GLPs is required?\n\nYes.\n\nMust a contractor include in the final report information on test article characterization and stability when such information has been collected by the sponsor?\n\nNo. The contractor should identify in its final report which information will be subsequently supplied by the sponsor.\n\nMust a sponsor reveal toxicology data already collected on a test article to a contract laboratory?\n\nNo. If use of the test article involves a potential danger to laboratory personnel, the contract laboratory should be advised so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n\nSection 58.15 Inspection of a testing facility.\n\nWhat is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n\nThe FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection. The items listed on the form serve as the basis for the exit discussion with laboratory management at which time management can either agree or disagree with the items and can offer possible corrective actions to be taken.\n\nManagement may also respond to the district office in writing after it has had sufficient time to properly study the FD-483.\n\nWill a laboratory subsequently be notified of GLP deviations not listed on the FD-483?\n\nThis does happen. The FDA investigator prepares an establishment\n\ninspection report (EIR) which summarizes the observations made at the\n\nlaboratory and which contains exhibits concerning the studies audited\n\n(Protocols, SOPs, CV's, etc.).

These include: A GLP inspection -\n\nan inspection undertaken as a periodic, routine determination of a\n\nlaboratory's compliance with the GLPs, it includes examination of an\n\nongoing study as well as a completed study; A data audit - an\n\ninspection made to verify that the information contained in a final\n\nreport submitted to FDA is accurate and reflected by the raw data; A\n\ndirected inspection - any of a series of inspections conducted for\n\nvarious compelling reasons (questionable data in a final report, tips\n\nfrom informers, etc.); A followup inspection - an inspection made\n\nsometime after a GLP inspection which revealed objectionable\n\npractices and conditions. The purpose of the followup inspection is\n\nto assure that proper corrective actions have been taken. GLP\n\ninspections are scheduled once every two years whereas the other\n\nkinds of inspections are scheduled as needed.\n\nShould GLP investigators comment on the scientific merits of a protocol or the scientific interpretation given in the final report? No. Their function is strictly a noting of observations and verification. Scientific judgments are made by the respective headquarters review units that deal with the test article.\n\nCan a GLP EIR be reviewed by laboratory, management prior to issuance? No. The GLP EIR is an internal agency document which reflects the observations and findings of the FDA investigator. It can not be released to anyone outside the agency until agency action has been completed and the released copy is purged of all trade secret information. Laboratories that disagree with portions of the EIR should write a letter which contains the areas of disagreement to the local FDA District Office. The laboratories can ask that their letters accompany the EIR whenever it is requested under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nCan FDA investigators take photographs of objectionable practices and conditions? It is the agency position that photographs can be taken as a part of the inspection and this position has been sustained by a District Court decision.\n\nThe GLP Compliance Program requires the FDA investigator to select an ongoing study in order to inspect current laboratory operations. What criteria are used to select the study? The studies are selected in accord with agency priorities, i.e. the longest term study on the most significant product.\n\nDoes FDA inspect international nonclinical laboratories once every two years? No. Overseas laboratories are scheduled for inspection on the basis of having submitted to FDA the results of significant studies on important products.\n\nWhat background materials are used by agency investigators to prepare for a GLP inspection? Prior to an inspection, the following materials are usually reviewed:(a) The GLP regulations; (b) The Management Briefings Post-Conference Report; (c) Assorted memoranda and policy issuances; (d) The GLP Compliance Program; (e) The protocol of an ongoing study, if available; (f) The final report of a completed study, if available; (g) The inspection report of the most recent inspection.\n\nHow long does FDA allow a laboratory to effect corrective actions after an inspection has been made? If the results of an inspection reveal that significant deviations from the GLPs exist, the laboratory will be sent a regulatory letter that lists the major deviations and that requests a response within 10 days. The response should describe those actions that the laboratory has taken or plans to take to effect correction. The response should also encompass items that were listed on the FD-483 and those that were discussed during the exit discussion with laboratory management. A specific time table should be given for accomplishing the planned actions. The reasonableness of the time table will be determined by FDA compliance staff, based on the needs of the particular situation. For less significant deviations, the laboratory will be sent a Notice of Adverse Findings letter that also lists the deviations but that requests a response within 30 days. Again, the reasonableness of the response will be determined by FDA staff.\n\nDoes a laboratory's responsibility for corrective action listed on a FD-483 begin at the conclusion of an inspection or upon receipt of correspondence from the originating bureau in which corrective action is requested? The FD-483 lists observations of violative conditions that have the capability to adversely affect nonclinical laboratory studies. Corrective actions should be instituted as soon as possible.\n\nDoes FDA preannounce all GLP inspections? Laboratory management is informed of all routine GLP inspections prior to the inspection, but special compliance or investigative inspections need not be preannounced.\n\nSUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that \"personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform\" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an \"acting\" or \"deputy\" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated \"deputy\" or \"acting\" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7553741931915283", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Under 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v), an applicant may submit one or more protocols (i.e., comparability protocols) describing tests, studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the absence of an adverse effect from specified types of changes. A comparability protocol can be used to reduce the reporting category for specified changes. A proposed comparability protocol must be submitted as a prior approval supplement, if not approved as part of the original application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v)). On February 25, 2003, FDA issued a draft guidance on comparability protocols entitled Comparability protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\n4 General Requirements\n\nOther than for editorial changes in previously submitted information (e.g., correction of spelling or typographical errors, reformatting of batch records), an applicant must notify FDA about each change in each condition established in an approved application beyond the variations already provided for in the application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nA supplement or annual report must include a list of all changes contained in the supplement or annual report (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). On the list, FDA recommends that the applicant describe each change in enough detail to allow FDA to quickly determine whether the appropriate reporting category has been used. For supplements, this list must be provided in the cover letter (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). In annual reports, the list should be included in the summary section. The supplement or annual report also is required to describe the change fully (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nAn applicant making a change to an approved application under section 506A of the Act also must conform to other applicable laws and regulations, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Act (21 U.S.C. SS 351(a)(2)(B)) and applicable regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226, and 514). For example, manufacturers must comply with relevant CGMP validation and recordkeeping requirements (21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226) and ensure that relevant records are readily available for examination by authorized FDA personnel during an inspection.\n\nAn applicant must include a statement in each supplement and amendment to a supplement certifying that a field copy has been provided to the appropriate FDA district office (21 CFR514.8(b)(1)(iv)).3\n\nFootnote 3: For a change to a product manufactured in a foreign facility, a field copy of the supplement or its amendment is not required to be submitted to an FDA district office. However, FDA recommends that the applicant state that the drug made with the change is manufactured only at a foreign site.\n\n4 Assessing the effect of manufacturing changes\n\nAssessment of the Effects of the Change\n\nThe holder of an approved application under section 512 of the Act must assess the effects of the change before distributing a drug made with a manufacturing change (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii)).4 For each change, the supplement or annual report must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change (section 506A(b), (c)(1), (d)(2)(A), and (d)(3)(A) of the Act). The type of information that must be included in a supplemental application or annual report is specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(iv), (b)(3)(vi), and (b)(4)(iii).\n\nFootnote 4: Assess the effects of the change means to evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(i)). The term assess or assessment as used in this guidance are not the same as validation. Certain validation information, such as sterilization processes, is considered information that is needed to assess the effect of the change as specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii) and should be submitted in an NADA or ANADA. Unless otherwise specified by FDA, other validation (e.g., process, equipment) data need not be submitted in the application, but must be retained at the facility and be available for review by FDA (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180).\n\nConformance to Specifications\n\nAn assessment of the effects of a change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug should include a determination that the drug substance intermediates, drug substance, in-process materials, and/or drug product affected by the change conform to the approved specifications.5 A specification is a quality standard (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drugs including, for example, drug substances, Type A medicated articles, drug products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Acceptance criteria are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Conformance to a specification means that the material, when tested according to the analytical procedures listed in the specification, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.\n\nFootnote 5: If a specification needs to be revised as a result of the change, this would be considered a multiple change (see sections VIII and XI).\n\n3 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nIn addition to confirming that the material affected by manufacturing changes continues to meet its specification, the applicant should perform additional testing, when appropriate, to assess whether the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug have been or will be affected. The assessment should include, as appropriate, evaluation of any changes in the chemical, physical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and/or stability profiles. This additional assessment could involve testing of the post-change drug itself or, if appropriate, the material directly affected by the change. The type of additional testing that an applicant should perform would depend on the type of manufacturing change, the type of drug, and the effect of the change on the quality of the drug. For example:\n\nEvaluation of changes in the impurity or degradant profile could first involve profiling using appropriate chromatographic techniques and then, depending on the observed changes in the impurity profile, toxicology tests to qualify a new impurity or degradant or to qualify an impurity that is above a previously qualified level.6 Footnote 6: Recommendations on identifying, qualifying, and reporting impurities can be found in relevant guidances (e.g., VICH GL10(R), Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances (Revision), Draft Revised Guidance, (GFI 92) (January 6, 2006)).\n\nEvaluation of the hardness or friability of a tablet after certain changes.\n\nAssessment of the effect of a change on bioequivalence could include, for example, multipoint and/or multimedia dissolution profiling and/or an in vivo bioequivalence study.\n\nEvaluation of extractables from new packaging components or moisture permeability of a new container closure system.\n\nAn applicant should refer to all relevant FDA guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change. If guidance for information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, CVM's Division of Manufacturing Technologies, HFV-140, should be consulted.\n\nEquivalence\n\nWhen testing is performed, the applicant should assess the extent to which the manufacturing change has affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug product. Typically, this is accomplished by comparing test results from pre- andpost-change material and determining if the test results are equivalent. Simply stated: Is the drug made after the change equivalent to the drug made before the change? Equivalence comparisons frequently have a criterion for comparison with calculation of confidence intervals relative to a predetermined equivalence interval. For this, as well as for other reasons, equivalent does not necessarily mean identical. Equivalence also may relate to maintenance of a quality characteristic (e.g., stability) rather than a single performance of a test.\n\nAdverse Effect\n\nSome manufacturing changes have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug. In many cases, the applicant chooses not to implement these manufacturing changes, but sometimes the applicant wishes to do so. If an assessment indicates that a change has adversely affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug, FDA recommends that the change be submitted in a prior approval supplement, regardless of the recommended reporting category for the change. For example, a process change recommended for a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement could cause the formation of a new degradant that requires qualification and/or identification. The applicant's degradation qualification procedures may indicate that there are no safety concerns relating to the new degradant. Even so, the applicant should submit this change in a prior approval supplement with appropriate information to support the continued safety and effectiveness of the drug. During the review of the prior approval supplement, FDA will assess the impact of any adverse effect on the drug as this change may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #83 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Changes to Approved NADA:ANADA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.039156913757324", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Part 1: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance.)_\n\nFDA Recognition #: (e.g., 19-4)\n\nOptions Selected\n\nStandard included no options\n\nStandard included options\n\nList of options selected in standard (e.g., clause 5.3 permits modified test conditions if ambient temperature cannot be maintained).

Objective\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance represents the agency\u2019s current thinking on the duration of chronic toxicity testing in animals (rodent and nonrodent toxicity testing). It does not create or confer any rights for or any person and does not operate to fluid FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable state, regulations, or both.\n\n1. Objective\n\nThe objective of this guidance is to set out the considerations that apply to chronic toxicity testing in rodents and nonrodents as part of the safety evaluation of a medicinal product. Since guidance is not legally binding, an applicant may submit justification for an alternative approach.\n\n2. Scope\n\nThis guidance has been prepared for the development of medicinal products with the exception of those already covered by the ICH guidance \"S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals\" (62 FR G1515, November 18, 1997), e.g., monoclonal antibodies, recombinant DNA proteins.\n\n3. Background\n\nDuring the first International Conference on Harmonisation in 1991, the practices for the testing of chronic toxicity in the three regions (the European Union, Japan, and the United States) were reviewed. Arising from this, it emerged that there was a scientific consensus on the approach for chronic testing in rodents, supporting the harmonized duration of testing of 6 months. However, for chronic toxicity testing in nonrodents, there were different approaches to the duration of testing.\n\nAs with all of FDA's guidances, the need for pharmaceutical companies to perform partially duplicative studies for both 6 and 12 months' duration when developing new medicinal products. As the objective of ICH is to reduce or eliminate the need to duplicate testing during development of medicinal products and to ensure a more economical use of material, animal, and human resources, while at the same time maintaining safeguards to protect public health, further scientific evaluation was undertaken.\n\nEach of the regulatory authorities in the European Union, Japan, and the United States undertook a review to determine whether a single duration for chronic toxicity testing in nonrodents could be identified. From this analysis, it emerged that in 16 cases a more detailed evaluation of 6 versus 12 months' data should be undertaken.\n\nThis evaluation was conducted as a joint excerercise by the competent authorities in the three regions.\n\nIn some of the cases analyzed at the tripartite meetings, there were no additional findings at 12 months. For some other cases, there was not complete agreement among the regulators with respect to the comparability in study design and conduct to allow assessment of whether there were differences in the findings at 6 and 12 months due to duration of treatment alone.\n\nIn a number of cases there were findings observed by 12 months, but not by 6 months. It was concluded that these would, or could, have been detected in a study of 9 months' duration. Varying degrees of concern for the differences in findings detected between the studies of different durations were expressed. An agreement on the clinical relevance of these findings could not be reached.\n\nStudies of 12 months' duration are usually not necessary, and studies of shorter than 9 months' duration may be sufficient.\n\nIn the European Union, studies of 6 months' duration in nonrodents are acceptable according to Council Directive 75/318/ECE, as amended. To avoid duplication, where studies with a longer duration have been conducted, it would not be necessary to conduct a study of 6 months.\n\n4.

However, conventional allometric scaling methods for CGT products may be less precise than for small-molecule drugs, and traditional PK and pharmacodynamic correlations might not be possible. Therefore, it may be difficult to establish an initial starting dose based on the considerations used for small-molecule drugs. If available, previous clinical experience with the CGT product or related products, even if by a different route of administration or for a different condition, might help to justify the clinical starting dose.\n\nConsiderations Regarding How Dose is Described One of the objectives of early-phase trials should be the identification of the product attribute (or attributes) that is most relevant to characterizing dose. To that end, it is important to collect data on characteristics of the administered product and clinical outcomes that will enable correlative analyses to help in dose definition. Selecting the study dose(s) of a CT product can be challenging. Dosing to target a therapeutic effect might be based on one cell type, but adverse reactions might depend more on a different cell type that is present in the same product. The active cell subset may not be known, so the dose is based on a specific subset that is thought to be the best representation of the desired activity. For example, for a CT product derived from cord blood or other hematopoietic tissues, the total number of nucleated cells might be used as the measure of dose, but the number of CD3+ cells could be an important aspect of the dose for consideration of certain safety outcomes, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). In situations where there is uncertainty about the cell subset(s) responsible for the therapeutic or adverse effects, collecting data on various cell subsets in the final CT product, with a comparison of clinical outcomes associated with these different subsets, may help to identify the cell subsets most relevant to product safety and effectiveness. For many GT products, dose is based on vector titer. However, some vector types may have specific properties that necessitate dosing using alternative units. For example, viral particles that do not contain the therapeutic gene are unlikely to have therapeutic activity. However, these particles themselves might produce adverse reactions, such as an allergic response. Therefore, if there are such safety considerations, the study dose(s) should be based on the total particle number, as is the case with adenoviral vectors. Other considerations for describing dosing may be related to the strengths and weaknesses of the methods available to accurately quantify specific attributes of the GT products. For example, adeno-associated viral\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(AAV) vectors are typically dosed based on vector genomes, due to the strengths of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and the difficulties in quantitating transducing units.\n\nFor gene-modified cells, dosing should consider several factors, including transduction efficiency. For some products, transduction efficiency can vary from lot to lot. This variation might lead to substantial differences in the active dose administered to different subjects. Ideally, manufacturers should work to control variability in the transduction process. If variability in transduction is occurring, and if the transduced cell number can be identified prior to product administration, then transduced cell number might provide more consistent dosing among subjects. In addition to transduction efficiency, other factors that should be considered in determining the dose include the total number of cells administered to subjects, the mean number of copies of vector sequences integrated per cell, and cell viability.\n3. Dose Escalation and Regimen Clinical development of CGT products has often included dose escalation in half-log (approximately three-fold) increments. However, the dosing increments used for dose escalation should consider preclinical and any available clinical data regarding the risks and activity associated with changes in dose.\n\nMany CGT products can persist in the subject or have an extended duration of activity, so that repeated dosing might not be an acceptable risk until there is a preliminary understanding of the product's toxicity and duration of activity.\n\nTherefore, most first-in-human CGT trials use a single administration or one-time dosing regimen. However, for some CGT products, such as therapeutic vaccines, multiple administrations may be appropriate for early-phase trials.\n\n5 Treatment Plan\n\nStaggering Administration When there is no previous human experience with a specific CGT product or related product, treating several subjects simultaneously may represent an unreasonable risk. To address this issue, most first-in-human trials of CGT products include staggered treatment to limit the number of subjects who might be exposed to an unanticipated safety risk.\n\nWith staggered treatment, there is a specified follow-up interval between administration of the product to a subject, or small group of subjects, and administration to the next subject or group of subjects. For example, in a dose-escalation study, the first several individual subjects within the first cohort might be staggered, followed by staggering between cohorts. Depending on the degree of safety concern, staggered treatment of individual subjects within each new cohortmight be appropriate. When the dose of the CGT product is difficult to quantify precisely or is highly variable due to manufacturing issues, it may be necessary to stagger additional subjects.\n\nThe staggering interval, either within a cohort or between cohorts, is intended to be long enough to monitor for acute and subacute adverse events prior to treating additional subjects at the same dose, or prior to increasing the dose in subsequent subjects. The choice of staggering interval should consider the time course of acute and subacute adverse events that was observed in the animal studies and in any previous human experience with related products. The staggering interval should also consider the expected duration of product activity. However, the staggering interval should be practical in the context of overall development timelines.\n\n2 Cohort Size\n\nFor trials that enroll sequential cohorts with dose-escalation between cohorts, the choice of cohort size should consider the amount of risk that is acceptable in the study population. Larger cohorts might be necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety before escalating the dose of a product intended to treat a disease that is less serious and for which the tolerance for accepting risk might be lower. Smaller cohorts might be adequate for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease where a greater potential benefit may justify a higher risk. Standardized protocol designs, such as the 3+3 design, are often used for dose escalation of oncology products. However, the cohort size in such a design might not be appropriate for other therapeutic areas where there is less tolerance of risk, and a larger cohort might be needed to provide a greater assurance of safety prior to dose escalation. In addition, other study objectives, such as assessments of tolerability, feasibility, and pharmacologic activity may influence choice of cohort size.\n\nFor CGT products, manufacturing capacity is often limited, which might place a practical limit on cohort size, particularly early in clinical development. The prevalence of the proposed study population may also limit the cohort size. When considering the limitations due to manufacturing capacity and prevalence of the study population, sponsors should select a cohort size that is feasible, but still adequate to meet the study objectives.\n\n3 Operator Training and Documentation of Procedures\n\nFor product delivery that involves a complex administration procedure or a device requiring special training, such as subretinal injection or use of specialized catheters for cardiac administration, the skill of the individual administering the product can impact the product's safety and efficacy. When individual skill in administering a product may affect its safety or effectiveness, the trial should specify minimum requirements for the operator's training, experience, or level of proficiency. In some cases (particularly, if there are multiple operators), training of operators on the specific administration procedures may reduce variability of administration and thereby improve interpretability of the study results. Detailed, written standard operating procedures (SOPs) can also help ensure safety and consistency in product administration. Careful recording of steps and observations during the administration process can help identify the operator's compliance with the protocol. These records can also facilitate correlating procedure variations with clinical outcomes and identify modifications that may improve the administration process.\n\n4 Considerations for Patient-Specific Products\n\nAs discussed earlier, some CT products or gene-modified cells are manufactured using cells or tissue from the intended recipient or from an allogeneic donor selected because of immunological matching to the recipient. In these cases, the product needs to be manufactured separately for each subject in a trial.\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations for the Design of Early-Phase Clinical Trials of Cellular and Gene Therapy Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.9105987548828125", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 3 Study Designs for Assessing Dose Response\n\nGeneral\n\nThe choice of study design and study population in dose-response trials will depend on the phase of development, the therapeutic indication under investigation, and the severity of the disease in the patient population of interest. For example, the lack of appropriate salvage therapy for life-threatening or serious conditions with irreversible outcomes may ethically preclude conduct of studies at doses below the maximum tolerated dose. A homogeneous patient population will generally allow achievement of study objectives with small numbers of subjects given each treatment. On the other hand, larger, more diverse populations allow detection of potentially important covariate effects.\n\nIn general, useful dose-response information is best obtained from trials specifically designed to compare several doses. A comparison of results from two or more controlled trials with single fixed doses might sometimes be informative, e.g., if control groups were similar, although even in that case, the many across-study differences that occur in separate trials usually make this approach unsatisfactory. It is also possible in some cases to derive, retrospectively, blood concentration-response relationships from the variable concentrations attained in a fixed-dose trial. While these analyses are potentially confounded by disease severity or other patient factors, the information can be useful and can guide subsequent studies. Conducting dose-response studies at an early stage of clinical development may reduce the number of failed Phase 3 trials, speeding the drug development process and conserving development resources.\n\nPharmacokinetic information can be used to choose doses that ensure adequate spread of attained concentration-response values and diminish or eliminate overlap between attained concentrations in dose-response trials. For drugs with high pharmacokinetic variability, a greater spread of doses could be chosen. Alternatively, the dosing groups could be individualized by adjusting for pharmacokinetic covariates (e.g., correction for weight, lean body mass, or renal function) or a concentration-controlled study could be carried out.\n\nAs a practical matter, valid dose-response data can be obtained more readily when the response is measured by a continuous or categorical variable, is relatively rapidly obtained after therapy is started, and is rapidly dissipated after therapy is stopped (e.g., blood pressure, analgesia, bronchodilation). In this case, a wider range of study designs can be used and relatively small, simple studies can give useful information. Placebo-controlled individual subject titration designs typical of many early drug development studies, for example, properly conducted and analyzed (quantitative analysis that models and estimates the population and individual dose-response relationships), can give guidance for more definitive parallel, fixed-dose, dose-response studies or may be definitive on their own.\n\nIn contrast, when the study endpoint or adverse effect is delayed, persistent, or irreversible (e.g., stroke or heart prevention, asthma prophylaxis, arthritis treatments with late onset response, survival in cancer, treatment of depression), titration and simultaneous assessment of response is usually not possible, and the parallel dose-response study is usually needed. The parallel dose-response study also offers protection against missing an effective dose because of an inverted \"U-shaped\" (umbrella or bell-shaped) dose-response curve, where higher doses are less effective than lower doses, a response that can occur, for example, with mixed agonist-antagonists.\n\nTrials intended to evaluate dose- or concentration-response should be well-controlled, using randomization and blinding (unless blinding is unnecessary or impossible) to assure comparability of treatment groups and to minimize potential patient, investigator, and analyst bias, and should be of adequate size.\n\nIt is important to choose as wide a range of doses as is compatible with practicality and patient safety to discern clinically meaningful differences. This is especially important where there are no pharmacologic or plausible surrogate endpoints to give initial guidance as to dose.\n\nB. Specific Trial DesignsA number of specific study designs can be used to assess\n\ndose-response. The same approaches can also be used to measure concentration-response relationships. Although not intended to be an exhaustive list, the following approaches have been shown to be useful ways of deriving valid dose-response information. Some designs outlined in this guidance are better established than others, but all are worthy of consideration. These designs can be applied to the study of established clinical endpoints or surrogate endpoints.\n\nParallel Dose-Response\n\nRandomization to several fixed-dose groups (the randomized parallel dose-response study) is simple in concept and is a design that has had extensive use and considerable success. The fixed dose is the final or maintenance dose; patients may be placed immediately on that dose or titrated gradually (in a scheduled \"forced\" titration) to it if that seems safer. In either case, the final dose should be maintained for a time adequate to allow the dose-response comparison. Although including a placebo group in dose-response studies is desirable, it is not theoretically necessary in all cases; a positive slope, even without a placebo group, provides evidence of a drug effect. To measure the absolute size of the drug effect, however, a placebo or comparator with very limited effect on the endpoint of interest is usually needed.\n\nMoreover, because a difference between drug groups and placebo unequivocally shows effectiveness, inclusion of a placebo group can salvage, in part, a study that used doses that were all too high and, therefore, showed no dose-response slope, by showing that all doses were superior to placebo. In principle, being able to detect a statistically significant difference in pair-wise comparisons between doses is not necessary if a statistically significant trend (upward slope) across doses can be established using all the data. It should be demonstrated, however, that the lowest dose(s) tested, if it is to be recommended, has a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect.\n\nThe parallel dose-response study gives group mean\n\n(population-average) dose-response, not the distribution or shape of individual dose-response curves.\n\nIt is all too common to discover, at the end of a parallel\n\ndose-response study, that all doses were too high (on the plateau of the dose-response curve), or that doses did not go high enough. A formally planned interim analysis (or other multi-stage design)might detect such a problem and allow study of the proper dose range.\n\nAs with any placebo-controlled trial, it may also be useful to include one or more doses of an active drug control. Inclusion of both placebo and active control groups allows assessment of \"assay sensitivity,\" permitting a distinction between an ineffective drug and an \"ineffective\" (null, no test) study. Comparison of dose-response curves for test and control drugs, not yet a common design, may also represent a more valid and informative comparative effectiveness/safety study than comparison of single doses of the two agents.\n\nThe factorial trial is a special case of the parallel dose-response study to be considered when combination therapy is being evaluated. It is particularly useful when both agents are intended to affect the same response variable (a diuretic and another anti-hypertensive, for example), or when one drug is intended to mitigate the side effects of the other. These studies can show effectiveness (a contribution of each component of the combination) and, in addition, provide dosing information for the drugs used alone and together.\n\nA factorial trial employs a parallel fixed-dose design with a range of doses of each separate drug and some or all combinations of these doses. The sample size need not be large enough to distinguish single cells from each other in pair-wise comparisons because all of the data can be used to derive dose-response relationships for the single agents and combinations, i.e., a dose-response surface. These trials, therefore, can be of moderate size. The doses and combinations that could be approved for marketing might not be limited to the actual doses studied but might include doses and combinations in between those studied. There may be some exceptions to the ability to rely entirely on the response surface analysis in choosing dose(s). At the low end of the dose range, if the doses used are lower than the recognized effective doses of the single agents, it would ordinarily be important to have adequate evidence that these can be distinguished from placebo in a pair-wise comparison. One way to do this in the factorial study is to have the lowest dose combination and placebo groups be somewhat larger than other groups; another is to have a separate study of the low-dose combination. Also, at the high end of the dose range, it may be necessary to confirm the contribution of each component to the overall effect.\n\nCross-over Dose-Response\n--------------------\nContext title: E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.333039283752441", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: It is prudent to carry out dose-ranging or concentration-response studies early in development as well as in later stages in order to avoid failed Phase 3 studies or accumulation of a database that consists largely of exposures at ineffective or excessive doses. The endpoints of studiesmay vary at different stages of drug development. For example, in studying a drug for heart failure, a pharmacodynamic endpoint might be used early (e.g., cardiac output, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), an intermediate endpoint might be used later (e.g., exercise tolerance, symptoms) and a mortality or irreversible morbidity endpoint might be the final assessment (survival, new infarction). It should be anticipated that the dose response for these endpoints may be different. Of course, the choice of endpoints that must be studied for marketing approval will depend on the specific situation.\n\nA widely used, successful, and acceptable design, but not the only study design for obtaining population average dose-response data, is the randomized parallel, dose-response study with three or more dosage levels, one of which may be zero (placebo). From such a trial, if dose levels are well chosen, the relationship of drug dosage, or drug concentration, to clinical beneficial or undesirable effects can be defined. Several dose levels are needed, at least two in addition to placebo, but in general, study of more than the minimum number of doses is desirable. A single dose level of drug versus placebo allows a test of the null hypothesis of no difference between drug and placebo, but cannot define the dose-response relationship. Similarly, although a linear relationship can be derived from the response to two active doses (without placebo), this approximation is usually not sufficiently informative. Study designs usually should emphasize elucidation of the dose-response function, not individual pair-wise comparisons. If a particular point on the curve, e.g., whether a certain low dose is useful, becomes an issue, it should be studied separately.\n\nDose-response data for both beneficial and undesirable effects may provide information that allows approval of a range of doses that encompass an appropriate benefit-to-risk ratio. A well-controlled dose-response study is also a study that can serve as primary evidence of effectiveness.\n\nRegulatory agencies and drug developers should be open to new approaches and to the concept of reasoned and well-documented exploratory data analysis of existing or future databases in search of dose-response data. Agencies should also be open to the use of various statistical and pharmacometric techniques such as Bayesian and population methods, modeling, and pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic approaches. However, these approaches should not subvert the requirement for dose-response data from prospective, randomized, multi-dose-level clinical trials. Post-hoc exploratory data analysis in search of dose-response information from databases generated to meet other objectives will often generate new hypotheses, but will only occasionally provide definitive assessment of dose-response relationships.\n\nA variety of data analytical techniques, including increased use of retrospective population-type analyses, and novel designs (e.g., sequential designs) may help define the dose-response relationship. For example, fixed-dose designs can be reanalyzed as a continuum of dose levels if doses are refigured on a milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) basis, or adjusted for renal function, lean body mass, etc. Similarly, blood levels taken during a dose-response study may allow estimates of concentration-response relationships. Adjustment of drug exposure levels might be made on the basis of reliable information on drug-taking compliance. In all of these cases, one should always be conscious of confounding, i.e., the presence of a factor that alters both the refigured dose and response or that alters both blood level and response, compliance and response, etc.\n7. Dose-response data should be explored for possible differences in subsets based on demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, or race. To do this, it is important to know whether there are pharmacokinetic differences among these groups, e.g., due to metabolic differences, differences in body habitus, or composition, etc.\n8. Approval decisions are based on a consideration of the totality of information on a drug. Although dose-response information should be available, depending on the kind and degree of effectiveness shown, imperfections in the database may be acceptable with the expectation that further studies will be carried out after approval. Thus, informative dose-response data, like information on responses in special populations, on long-term use, on potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, is expected, but might, in the face of a major therapeutic benefit or urgent need, or very low levels of observed toxicity, become a deferred requirement.\n\nV Reference\n\nFederal Register.

The proposed guideline will elaborate the knowledge requirements that guide the technical and scientific studies that might be carried out to establish that, for example, the dosage form, formulation, manufacturing process and development, container closure system, and microbiological attributes are appropriate for the product described in the application. These are generally 'one time' studies that the applicant carried out in the course of the development of the drug product and are part of a background and context of scientific information that assists the Regulatory Reviewer in understanding the critical-to-quality attributes of the drug product and its manufacturing process. Potential topics to be addressed within P2 are illustrated below and could include sections on\n\nDrug substance\n\nKey physicochemical characteristics and their impact on formulation and/or manufacturing process design\n\nCompatibility (with excipients and packaging materials)Exciipients\n\nKey physicochemical and/or biopharmaceutical characteristics\n\nDrug Product\n\nRationale for type of product\n\nFormulation development\n\nOverages\n\nPhysicochemical and biological properties and their impact on product quality (risk analysis)\n\nPerformance testing\n\nManufacturing Development\n* Critical to quality manufacturing steps and process controls and their contribution to or interdependency with final product quality (risk analysis)\n* Choice of sterilisation method\n* Relationship of manufacturing performance and controls to end product testing (risk analysis)\n\nContainer closure system (and delivery devices)\n\nMicrobiological attributes\n\nIssues to be Resolved\n\nScope: what is included from e.g.,\n\nNew chemical entities\n\nNew biological entities\n\nSolid oral dosage forms\n\nOral liquids\n\nParenterals\n\nTopicals\n\nInhalation\n\nOthers?\n\nIn summary, it is proposed that the scope be the combination of the scopes described in Q6a and Q6b.

Subjects who withdraw or dropout of the treatment group or the comparator group will tend to have a lack of response, and hence the results of using the full analysis set (see Glossary) may be biased toward demonstrating equivalence (see Section 5.2.3).\n\n3.3.3 Trials to Show Dose-response Relationship\n\nHow response is related to the dose of a new investigational product is a question to which answers may be obtained in all phases of development, and by a variety of approaches (see ICH E4). Dose-response trials may serve a number of objectives, amongst which the following are of particular importance: the confirmation of efficacy; the investigation of the shape and location of the dose-response curve; the estimation of an appropriate starting dose; the identification of optimal strategies for individual dose adjustments; the determination of a maximal dose beyond which additional benefit would be unlikely to occur. These objectives should be addressed using the data collected at a number of doses under investigation, including a placebo (zero dose) wherever appropriate. For this purpose the application of procedures to estimate the relationship between dose and response, including the construction of confidence intervals and the use of graphical methods, is as important as the use of statistical tests. The hypothesis tests that are used may need to be tailored to the natural ordering of doses or to particular questions regarding the shape of the dose-response curve (e.g. monotonicity). The details of the planned statistical procedures should be given in the protocol.\n\nGroup Sequential Designs\n--------------------\nContext title: E9_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.623801231384277"], "Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5.1.1 Examples of Benefit-Risk Evaluation\n\nThe examples below are hypothetical or simplified real-world situations and are offered only for illustrative purposes, i.e., no example is a complete assessment of the benefit-risk issues associated with any actual 510(k). The decisions described in these examples are not predictive of future FDA decisions; rather, they are hypothetical outcomes and are intended only to demonstrate how FDA could consider the factors described in this guidance when evaluating benefits and risks during a 510(k) premarket review. Similar scenarios or devices may result in different clearance outcomes depending on the individual performance characteristics of a particular device, the population for which it is indicated, and the context. These examples are not intended to provide device-specific data recommendations for the assessment of the factors.\n\nBecause this guidance document focuses on the part of the SE decision-making process occurring after FDA finds that the intended use of the new device and predicate device are the same, and that any differences in technological characteristics do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, these examples focus on the use of benefit-risk assessments after Decision #4 of the SE decision-making process, as described in Figure 1.\n\n5.1.2 Example 1: Change in Device Design\n\nScenario: A manufacturer submitted a 510(k) for a powered rongeur for use during spinal surgery that utilizes new designs, i.e., a different shape and a different, deeper cutting action than the identified predicate device. The new design presents increased risk because the new cutting action exposes additional anatomy of the patient to an increased risk of injury. On the other hand, the new design expedites the cutting process and minimizes the time needed for surgical procedures, and its shape allows easier access to specific anatomic regions than the available predicate devices. After reviewing bench testing, FDA noted that the bench testing was not designed to address the increased risk. The manufacturer provided performance data to demonstrate that the risks noted by the review team had very low incidence. The animal study made a direct comparison to the predicate device. The new device demonstrated shorter surgery time, and the results of a survey of the participating surgeons emphasized the ease of accessing more difficult anatomic areas compared to the predicate device, therefore reducing the likelihood of injury to neighboring tissue when accessing the difficult-to-reach anatomical areas in the patient. The device is also available in a range of sizes which also raises concerns about elevated risk if larger sizes than necessary are used because this resulted in higher adverse event rates in the animal study.\n\n5.1.3 Is a benefit-risk assessment recommended?\n\nYes. A benefit-risk assessment should be conducted to assess the increase in risk and increase in benefit.\n\nBenefits: Compared to the predicate device, the new device offers surgeons an option to access specific anatomic areas around the spine more easily with a lower likelihood of injury to neighboring tissue. In some cases, surgeons may prefer to use this tool rather than the predicatebecause the new device can offer a deeper cutting action which was demonstrated in the animal study to shorten the duration of surgery. In addition, shorter surgery time results in less time under anesthesia and less exposure to risk of infection.\n\nRisks: The new deeper cutting action introduces higher risks of injury to the dura, arteries, veins, and nerve roots than the predicate device. The manufacturer provided data from an animal study to address the higher level of risks associated with the new deeper cutting action. The data provided demonstrate that the probability of harm is low; however, using the incorrect size of the device was found to increase risk of injury in the animal study.\n\nAdditional Factors:\n\nRisk Mitigation: To address the concern of elevated risk due to using an incorrectly sized device, labeling is used to identify the proper size to be used based on anatomical measurements made before surgery.\n\nBenefit for the Health-Care Professional or Caregiver: The new design allows for easier use by the surgeons as demonstrated in the survey data provided by the manufacturer, thereby reducing risk of injury to the patient.\n\nSE Analysis: The technological differences present an increased risk of injury to the dura, arteries, veins, and nerve roots. The manufacturer provided animal study data to address these additional risks and to demonstrate that the probability of such harms is low. The manufacturer's labeling further mitigates risk observed in the animal testing by identifying methods to help the surgeon choose the proper device size. Furthermore, the animal study demonstrated that the new device shortened the surgery time compared to the predicate device, and surveys of participating surgeons emphasized the benefit of easier access to specific anatomic regions around the spine, thereby reducing risk of injury to the patient. Although the probable risk may be slightly higher than that of the predicate device due to the nature of cutting, the increase was demonstrated to be minimal. In addition, the non-clinical performance data did demonstrate benefit from the new shape and cutting action in terms of shortened surgical time and easier access. Because the increase in risk is accompanied by an increase in benefit and the new device would likely have a comparable benefit-risk profile to the predicate device for the indicated patient population, this device would likely be found SE.\n\nAppendix B Example 2: Change in Technology and Possible Change in Principle of Operation\n\nScenario: A self-contained device uses a low-level laser therapy for the treatment of toenail fungus (onychomycosis). The new device uses a different wavelength than the predicate device that was shown to produce different photo-biological effects, have a power level much lower than the predicate device, and have a constant energy delivery sequence in comparison to the pulsing sequence of the predicate device. For the treatment of onychomycosis, the purported mechanism of action is either a photo-biological process in which the laser wavelength interacts with chromophores within the fungal cells resulting in cell death or may involve a thermal effect on the fungal cells at temperatures below those required for tissue coagulation or tissue vaporization. Due to the differences in technological characteristics and possible changes in principles of operation between the new device and predicate device, the manufacturer provided clinical data to compare their device to the predicate device. The device would have equivalent benefit as the predicate device if a majority of the subjects were responders, where a responder is a subject for whom the toenail is effectively treated according to predefined success criteria. The clinical data demonstrated that the responder rate was lower in the group treated with the new device. The new device is considered to pose a lower risk than the predicate device because the power level of the new device is significantly lower.\n\nIs a benefit-risk assessment recommended?\n\nYes. A benefit-risk assessment should be conducted to assess the decrease in risk and decrease in benefit.\n\nBenefits: The new device offers an alternative treatment modality than the predicate device. However, the study failed to meet the primary endpoint, as data did not support that the majority of the responders saw treatment success.\n\nRisks: The new device offers lower risk to the subject with a reduction of power and offers minimal side effects when compared to the predicate device. Other risk mitigations include the wearing of laser safety protective glasses to prevent accidental eye damage from laser exposure.\n\nAdditional Factors:\n\nUncertainty: The results of the clinical study raised significant concerns regarding the reliability of the observed benefit of the new device. The proportion of responders was lower than desired. In addition, there were significant data inconsistencies regarding the manufacturer's photographs and data set in comparison to the predicate device.\n\nSE Analysis: Due to the differences in technological characteristics between the new device and predicate device, the manufacturer provided clinical data to establish SE. The clinical data failed to demonstrate the new device provided benefit for the majority of treated patients. In addition, the provided data presented significant inconsistencies and was considered not reliable. Although the new device imparts less risk, the benefit of the device is considerably smaller than the predicate device. Additionally, there is considerable uncertainty with the small benefit observed. Therefore, this device would likely be found NSE based on a lack of adequate performance data.\n\nAppendix C Example 3: New Device with Higher Risk of Malfunction\n\nScenario: A manufacturer submitted a 510(k) for an external infusion pump that can be used in an ambulatory, portable setting. The device manufacturer claimed SE to a standalone external infusion pump which is used within the hospital setting for controlled intravenous (IV) delivery of fluid and medications to patients. The new device utilizes a new, compact, portable platform that may be used to deliver IV therapy to a patient who is in transit via ambulance or other transport, such as a helicopter. Unlike the predicate device, the new device operates fully on a battery and has a smaller, simpler user interface than the predicate device. Because the new device is mobile, it can serve as a medical countermeasure to provide therapy to patients as part of a public health response to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive (CBRNE) event.18\n--------------------\nContext title: Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.092461585998535", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.4.2 Factors relevant to application of the algorithm.\n\nThe factors listed below are intended to further illustrate the kinds of issues that may be relevant when determining whether a new combination product presents safety and effectiveness issues similar to those presented by a previous combination product, or which are the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by a combination product. We note that the list of factors below is not all-inclusive. Also, FDA may consider individual characteristics of the specific product. Such case-by-case analysis allows the Agency to take into account, for example, technological developments, evolving scientific understanding, and specific factual information concerning the particular product, such as its composition, or mechanism of action for achieving an intended use.\n\nThe following questions are not listed in order of importance; indeed some factors may be weighted more than others depending on various issues presented by each individual combination product. If you believe FDA may need to consider the algorithm in the assignment of your product (i.e., if your product's most important therapeutic action cannot be determined with reasonable certainty), then we recommend you consider and address these and/or other safety and effectiveness issues, as applicable, for your product:\n\nWhat is the intended use(s)/indication(s) for use of the product?\n\nWhat is the overall therapeutic effect(s) of the product as a whole?\n\nDoes a device constituent part incorporate a novel or complex design or have the potential for clinically significant failure modes?\n\nIs a drug constituent part a new molecular entity or new formulation?\n\nHas a generic version of the drug been approved under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act?\n\nDoes the drug have a narrow therapeutic index?\n\nIs the biological product constituent part a particularly fragile molecule?\n\nHow well understood are the product's constituent parts? Is one constituent part relatively common, while another presents more significant safety and effectiveness issues relating to the risks it poses, its effectiveness, or its novelty?\n\nWhich constituent part raises greater risks?\n\nHave any of the constituent parts been previously approved or cleared for the same or a similar use?\n\nIs there a new indication, route of administration or a significant change in dose or use of one of the constituent parts?\n\nAddressing the assignment algorithm in your RFDIf you cannot determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of your combination product, you must recommend an assignment for your product based on the assignment algorithm at 21 CFR 3.4(b). See 21 CFR 3.7(c)(3). Under the first step, you should consider whether FDA regulates other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole. In other words, you should consider whether an FDA Center has direct experience with a combination product similar to yours. You should identify any such other combination products that you are aware of that you believe FDA should consider in determining the assignment of your product, and explain how your product is similar. For example, if you have developed a new drug for treating glaucoma that will be combined with a contact lens, and you are aware of other products reviewed by FDA that consist of a contact lens and another drug for this intended use, you should identify those products.\n\nIf you do not believe that your product as a whole is similar to other combination products that a Center has already reviewed or that you are aware a Center is currently reviewing, you should address the second step of the algorithm. Even if you believe your product is similar to another, we recommend that you explain how you think we should assign your product should we find it necessary to move to this second step in the algorithm. For this part of the algorithm, you should identify the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by your combination product, and explain, in your opinion, which Center has the most expertise related to those questions. For example, if this is the first time the Agency is presented with a vision-correcting contact lens containing a glaucoma drug, then, using the factors described above, you should explain, in your opinion, which Center has more expertise to answer these questions. In this case, you might explain that the most significant safety and effectiveness questions are related to the characterization, manufacturing, and clinical performance of the drug component, while the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the vision-correcting contact lens are considered more routine. Based on these criteria, you might recommend that CDER has the most expertise related to these issues.\n\n10 Schedule and Duration of Use.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(x)\n\nYou must briefly explain how often and for how long your product is intended to be used. For example, if your product is a non-combination device that would be implanted in the body during one surgical procedure, you should state the duration for which it is implanted or if it will be implanted with the expectation that, as long as the device functions, it will remain in the body indefinitely. In other cases, such as with a wound dressing, for instance, an RFD might explain that the dressing should be used over a four-hour period, after which a change of dressing would occur if needed, with a maximum of six dressings to be used over a 24-hour time period.\n\nAnother example would be that your product is a drug to be delivered by a device every twelve hours over a period of time not to exceed 10 days.\n\n11 Dose and Route of Administration.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xi)\n\nAs applicable, you should briefly explain the dose (amount) of the drug or biological product (or constituent part) to be used, and how it will be used in or on the body. For example, for a combination product wound dressing consisting of a drug and device delivery system, you would identify the specific amount of the drug contained in the device, and that it would be applied topically to the specific type of wound your product is intended to treat. If your product is an injectable drug, you would explain that the delivery device would be used to inject a specific dose of the drug intramuscularly, intravenously, etc.\n\nEven if you believe your product is a device (containing no drug or biological products), it may be helpful to provide information about the dose or route of administration for the product. For example, if your product is an injectable product, such as a wrinkle filler, you should describe the amount of product being injected and the site of the injection.\n\n12 Related Products.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xii)\n\nIf you think there are other products like yours, or other products with related components, you must briefly explain what they are, how they are regulated, and their regulatory status (e.g., approved, investigational, etc.) so that we can consider them when classifying and/or making the assignment for your product. Please include the product application numbers when available (e.g., 510(k) or NDA number). You should explain any similarities or differences between these products and your product and state how these are relevant to the classification and/or assignment of your product.\n\nIf you are not aware of other products like yours or other products with related components, please state this.\n\n13 Other Relevant Information.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xiii)\n\nIf you think there is anything else we should consider when determining the appropriate classification and/or assignment of your product, you should explain that in this portion of your RFD. For example, literature references describing the product, its components, and its modes of action are often helpful.\n\n14 Sponsor's Recommendation.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(3)\n\nThe final section of an RFD must include your recommendation for the classification (drug, device, biological product, or combination product) and assignment (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) of your product.\n\nIf you believe your product is a non-combination product, you should state whether you believe it meets the statutory definition of a drug, device, or biological product and your rationale for this recommendation. Your classification recommendation should be based on the composition, mode(s) of action, and intended use(s) of your product. Based on this recommended classification, you should then state your recommendation as to which Center (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) should regulate your product.\n\nIf you believe your product is a combination product, you should state what type of combination product it may be (e.g., drug/device) and your rationale for this recommendation. Next, you should explain which Center (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) should have primary jurisdiction (the \"lead\") for regulation of your product. This explanation should be based on the composition, intended use(s), modes of action, and PMOA of the product. If you cannot determine which single mode of action provides the most important therapeutic action of the product, you must use the algorithm set forth in 21 CFR 3.4(b) to make your recommendation of \"lead\" Center (see Section 9 above).\n\nIf you are unclear whether your product is a combination product or a non-combination product, we recommend you provide an analysis for the product being a combination product and for being a non-combination product.\n\nAppendix F How can I limit my submission to 15 pages including attachments as required by the regulation, and still provide all the information FDA needs to make its decision?\n--------------------\nContext title: How to Write a Request for Designation (RFD) Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.647442102432251", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Examples of considerations for target populations would include but are not limited to: the fraction of the affected population for which the test is expected to provide results, or the prevalence of the specific disease or other condition targeted by a test, if applicable.\n\n3 Specific User Needs for the Test\n\nProspectively determine and document, through consultation, professional experience, professional guidelines, and other relevant sources, specific test features that are needed to assure development of a test that meets users' needs.\n\n3.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe specific user needs will define critical factors to address during test design. It may be helpful to prioritize user needs so that the most critical ones receive the greatest design attention. Test developers should take into consideration the spectrum of test users when designing the test.\n\nAn example of a specific user need for the test is a user's need to process large numbers of samples within a limited turn-around time. This user need will help determine which NGS platform should be used as part of the test, how multiplexing is performed, and, potentially, how other aspects of the test are designed.\n\n3 Specim Type\n\nSpecify and document the acceptable specimen types to be used for the test.\n\nSpecimen types accepted for testing will raise design questions such as the type of collection device required, minimum volume or quantity of sample, or any collection conditions that must be adhered to for sample stability between collection and use. Multiple specimen and collection types may be appropriate for a test, but each type should be validated for use in producing DNA of the appropriate quality and quantity and for overall test performance. Appropriate specimen types may depend on the use of the test.\n\nExamples of specimen types include but are not limited to: whole blood, buccal swab.\n\n4 Interrogated Regions of the Genome\n\nSpecify and document the region(s) of the genome, including genes and variants, that will be interrogated by the test.\n\nThe types of genes sequenced and/or reported by the test will depend on the specific indications for use, which in turn will influence aspects of test design and definition of test performance. Provide and justify, using an evidence-based assessment, the genes that should be included for a given indication. Known clinically relevant variants for a given indication that fall outside of the region detected by the test should also be specified. If critical interrogated regions do not meet minimum performance specifications (e.g., minimum coverage thresholds), the test should be modified and revalidated to reach minimum applicable thresholds.\n\nExample: A test intended to aid in the diagnosis of suspected genetic disorders in newborns may use WES rather than a targeted panel of genes with well-defined clinical significance. In such a case, the test may be configured to report only a subset of genes from WES that may be related to suspected disease(s) or other condition(s) based on a patient's phenotype, clinical presentation, and previous available test results for the patient. For instance, a test might only report results from genes known to be related to cardiac disorders when such disorders are suspected based on clinical presentation.\n\n5 Performance Needs\n\nTo demonstrate performance needs, consider the following:\n\nDefine and document a minimum set of metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LoD)) that should be evaluated for an adequately analytically validated test.\n\nDefine and document appropriate performance thresholds for those metrics based on the test's indications for use statement and predefined user needs.\n\nDefine and document the degree to which interrogated regions that do not meet test run quality metrics (e.g., depth of coverage; see Section VI.C) can be included in the test.\n\nIdentify and document the use of secondary procedures (e.g., familial testing, orthogonal confirmation of results), as their use may affect performance needs.\n\nDocument possible limitations to test performance.\n\nExample: If specimens are limited (e.g., specimen volume is small, or it will not be possible to collect additional specimens from a patient) or if results will not be confirmed by an orthogonal method, the minimum accuracy of the test should be higher in regions from which results will be reported, and non-reported regions should be documented. Similarly, if part of an interrogated genomic region is difficult to sequence and cannot reach performance thresholds, this should be reported as a test limitation, and may inform the inclusion of confirmation by an orthogonal method during test design or may necessitate higher coverage in that region.\n\n6 Test Elements and Methods\n\nTest Element Specification\n\nSpecify and document all test elements (e.g., instrumentation, software, consumables, reagents), including those for procedures (e.g., materials for library preparation) and general laboratory equipment used for the test (e.g., automated liquid handlers). For each step of an NGS-based test, set technical specifications (e.g., throughput of a sequencing platform) for test elements based on identified user needs, the indications for use statement, and predefined performance specifications (e.g., accuracy thresholds). Document the limitations of each test element for critical factors (e.g., coverage, multiplexing).\n\nSpecifications should be determined and documented for each element of an NGS-based test. These specifications are generally driven by user needs, the indications for use statement, and the predefined performance thresholds. In some cases, test design issues may feed back into the indications for use statement or predefined performance thresholds. For instance, there may be a need to modify the indications for use statement to fit limitations imposed by the specific sequencing platform employed.\n\nListed below are recommendations for selected elements or steps of an NGS-based test:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nii.1.1 Sequencing Platform\n\nSpecify the sequencing platform that will be used.\n\nThe particular sequencing platform should have specific performance characteristics that align with user needs and the indications for use statement of the test.\n\nControls and Reference Materials\n\nSpecify controls and reference materials for achieving confidence in the test.\n\nThese should include, but are not limited to, controls per sample or per run, or other controls as needed, in order to establish the quality of performance. They can also include gene and disease specific controls for detecting common pathogenic variants used to diagnose well-defined diseases or other conditions, pan-disorder positive controls (most common pathogenic variants), and other appropriate controls and reference materials.\n\nBioinformatics\n\nDescribe and document data processing and analysis, including all procedures for variant calling, filtering, and annotation.\n\nSpecify and document all software to be used, including the source (e.g., developed in-house, third party), and any modifications.\n\nDocument software versions and traceability, reference sequence assembly, and elements needed to compile, install, and run the bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nSpecify and document whether software will be run locally or remotely (e.g., cloud-based).\n\nSpecify and document which databases (including versions as applicable) will be used (if any), and whether these are internal or third-party.\n\nThe bioinformatics pipeline should be selected based on the type of sequencing and the types of variants that will be reported by the test, and considering any limitations of the pipeline in variant calling and evaluation. Inclusion in the test design of third party bioinformatics tools should be done by documenting and validating bioinformatics software performance in the context of the end-to-end NGS-based test.\n\nMethods\n\nDevelop and document procedures and methods for running the test. Document in detail methods for each step of the test (e.g., DNA extraction, multiplexing). Develop and document procedures for using instruments, consumables, reagents, and supporting methods. Identify and document limitations, if any, for each step, including the potential impact on other steps.__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIdentify and document, as applicable, the type of sequencing that will be used (e.g., single-end/pair-end/mate-pair sequencing).\n\nSpecifications should be determined and documented for each method required for the NGS-based test. These specifications are generally defined by user and performance specifications.\n\nBelow is a list of recommendations for selected elements of an NGS-based test:\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations for Design, Development, and Analytical Validation of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) - Based In Vitro Diagnostics (IVDs) Intended to Aid in the Diagnosis of Suspected Germline Diseases\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.048614978790283", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: See, for example, FDA\u2019s guidance E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (September 1998); FDA\u2019s guidance Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices (November 2013); and FDA\u2019s guidance Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests (March 2007).\n\nIf the firm wishes to present this information in a CFL promotional communication, it must do so in a truthful and non-misleading way.23 For example, the firm could present the results from these analyses of the individual components of the composite endpoint descriptively without p-values and without claiming that the results on the individual components are demonstrated additional effects of the drug. The firm should also include contextual information to describe the material limitations of the data (see Q.8/A.8) - e.g., for this particular presentation, the firm could explain that because these analyses were not prespecified and appropriate multiplicity adjustments were not applied, the results on the individual components need cautious interpretation and could represent chance findings.\n\nFootnote 23: See sections 502(a), 502(n), 502(q), and 502(r) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 1.21 (a) and 202.1(e)(5).\n\nThus, in addition to being scientifically appropriate and statistically sound, the evidence should be accurately characterized in the CFL promotional communication, including limitations of the strength of the evidence and the conclusions that can be drawn from it (as discussed in Q.8/A.8). However, firms should note that if a CFL promotional communication relies on a study that is inadequate to support the representations or suggestions it presents, disclosure of the material limitations of that study does not correct the misleading message conveyed by the communication. For example, in the scenario described in the previous paragraphs, if the firm's communication represented or suggested that the results on the individual components are demonstrated additional effects of the drug, disclosing the limitations of the underlying evidence would not correct the misleading message conveyed by the communication. Rather, as previously mentioned, the information should be presented in a way that does not overstate the conclusions that can be drawn from the supporting evidence. And if a firm's communication is based on speculation or belief without scientific support or is based on a poorly designed or conducted study or analysis, that communication would not be consistent with the recommendations in this guidance, regardless of whether the communication discloses the lack of appropriate support for the information being presented.\n\nWhat other considerations apply to CFL promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling?\n\nIn addition to the considerations addressed in Q.6/A.6, firms should ensure their FDA-regulated promotional materials otherwise satisfy the applicable requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations.\n\nNothing in this guidance is intended to change a firm's existing obligations under the FD&C Act, the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), or FDA's implementing regulations to update its FDA-required labeling to ensure that the labeling is not false or misleading or for other reasons.24\n\nFootnote 24: See, for example, 21 CFR 201.56(a)(2) (\u201c[approved] labeling must be updated when new information becomes available that causes the labeling to become inaccurate, false, or misleading\u201d); 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12 (concerning supplements and other changes to an approved application, including labeling); 21 CFR 514.8(c) (concerning supplements and other changes to an approved application for a new animal drug, including labeling); 21 CFR 814.39 (concerning supplements to an approved premarket approval application (PMA), including labeling); and 21 CFR 814.108 (concerning supplements to an approved HDE application, including labeling).\n\nWhat does FDA recommend that firms consider when developing CFL promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling to help ensure that the presentation of this information does not render the communication false or misleading?\n\nThe way a firm presents information that is consistent with the FDA-required labeling (including the express and implied claims made and the overall impression created by the communication as a whole) affects how the information is understood. The following are some high-level recommendations for firms to consider when developing their presentations of information in CFL promotional communications to help ensure the presentations do not mislead the applicable audience(s):\n\nAny study results or other data and information that are relied upon to support a firm's CFL promotional communication should be accurately represented in the communications. Moreover, aspects of study design and methodology that are material for audiences to accurately interpret the information presented (e.g. type of study, study objectives, product dosage/use regimens, controls used, patient population studied) from any studies relied on should be clearly and prominently25 disclosed in firms' CFL promotional communications, and material limitations related to the study design, methodology, and results should also be disclosed in a clear and prominent manner.\n\nThe CFL promotional communication should accurately characterize and contextualize the relevant information about the product, including by disclosing unfavorable or inconsistent findings. For example, if a firm presents efficacy results from a postmarketing study of its product that evaluated the effect of the product on two different endpoints, such as overall survival and progression-free survival, and the product failed to demonstrate an effect on one of these two endpoints, the firm should clearly and prominently disclose this in the CFL promotional communication, rather than selectively presenting only the positive efficacy results.\n\nIf the FDA-required labeling contains data or information related to what is being represented/suggested in the CFL promotional communication, the communication should also include the data or information from the FDA-required labeling to provide the audience with appropriate context, and this information should be presented in a clear and prominent way. For example, if a communication provides postmarketing information about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse events that have been observed in practice, the communication should also include information from the FDA-required labeling about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials to provide context.\n\nThese considerations are not intended to be a comprehensive description of everything a firm should factor into its analysis of whether its presentations are truthful and non-misleading. FDA recommends that, before disseminating a CFL promotional communication, firms should have qualified medical/scientific, legal, and regulatory personnel carefully review the communication to ensure it is not false or misleading.\n\nWhat are some examples of promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling and with the recommendations in this guidance?\n\nThe following are two examples of promotional communications FDA would consider to be consistent with the FDA-required labeling and the recommendations in Q.6/A.6 and Q.8/A.8.\n\nExample 1: Product B is an Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% liquid indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) and chronic immune thrombocytopenia pur purura (IPT). Product B's firm develops promotional materials which communicate that clearance of Product B is comparable in males and females taking it to treat PI and IPT. These materials cite to the pharmacokinetic information obtained from the pivotal study of the product.\n\nIs this consistent with the FDA-required labeling? Yes. This claim about the product is within the scope of the uses approved by FDA, because the FDA-required labelingreflects that the product is indicated for use in both males and females to treat PI and IPT, and does not contain any limitations or directions or other special considerations related to the gender of patients using the product. The representation about similar clearance of the product in males and females is not expected to increase the potential for harm to patients, and the directions in the FDA-required labeling enable the product to be safely and effectively used to treat PI and IPT regardless of gender. This would be an example of a promotional communication that FDA would consider to be consistent with the FDA-required labeling.\n\nIs this truthful and non-misleading? Yes, assuming the clearance information from the pivotal study is accurately reported in the firm's CFL promotional communication and the material aspects of the underlying study design and methodology are disclosed, including any material limitations of the information. As indicated in Q.7/A.7, the firm should also ensure the rest of the information in the CFL promotional communication is truthful and non-misleading and satisfies any other applicable requirements.\n\nExample 2: An implantable device is approved for use as an adjunctive therapy for reducing symptoms of a chronic disease when symptoms are not adequately controlled by medication. The device is clinician/patient-controlled based on the disease state and symptoms. The directions for use do not prescribe a specific use schedule. In the clinical study that supported the device's premarket approval application (PMA), approximately half of the patients using the device reported severe headaches, but many patients tolerate this risk because of the benefits of amelioration of symptoms associated with their chronic illness.\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Product Communications That Are Consistent With the FDA-Required Labeling \u2014 Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.8764824867248535", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: For the first example, consider a disease where the cure rate is at least 40% in patients receiving the selected active control and 30% for those on placebo, a 10% difference in cure rates. If the purpose of an NI study is to demonstrate that the test product is effective (i.e., superior to a placebo), then the difference between the test product and active control in the NI study must be less than 10%. The margin M({}{1}) would then be 10%. If the additional clinical objective is to establish that the test product preserves at least half of the active control's effect, then the cure rate of the test product must be shown to be less than 5% lower than the control, the M({}{2}) margin.\n\nThis approach requires that the control drug have an effect of at least 10% relative to placebo (had there been one) in the NI study. If the population in the NI study did not have such a benefit (e.g., if the patients all had illnesses not susceptible to the test drug such that the benefit was less than 10%), then even if the 5% difference were ruled out, that would not demonstrate the desired effectiveness (although it would seem to). Note that in this case, if the true effect of the control in the study were 8%, then ruling out a 5% difference would in fact show some effect of the test drug, just not the desired 50% of control effect.\n\nThe second example illustrates a NI margin selected for the risk ratio (test/control) metric. Let C and P represent the true rates of an undesirable outcome for the control and a placebo, respectively. The control's effect compared to placebo is expressed by the risk ratio, C/P. A risk ratio of 1 represents no effect; a ratio of less than 1 shows an effect, a reduction in rate of undesirable outcomes.\n\nMetrics like the risk ratio may be less affected by variability in the event rates in a placebo group that would occur in a future study. For example, a risk ratio for the event of interest of 3/4 =0.75 can be derived from very different absolute failure rates from different studies, as shown in the table below. While the risk ratio is similar in all four hypothetical studies, the absolute difference in failure rates ranges from 5% to 20%. Suppose that the NI margin were based on historical studies showing control drug effects like those in the fourth study. The NI margin (M({}{1})) would then be chosen as 20%. Now suppose that under more modern circumstances the NI study had a control rate more like Study 1 and the size of the treatment effect compared to placebo is far less than 20%. An NI margin (M({}{1})) of 20% would then be far greater than the drug effect in the NI study, and ruling out a difference of 20% would not demonstrate effectiveness at all. Thus, if the NI margin were chosen as ruling out an inferiority of 33% (or a relative risk of 1.33, i.e., 1 (\\div) 0.75), and the control rate were 15%, the difference (M({}_{1})) between test and control would need to be less than 5% (15% x 1.33 = 20%, or 5% (>) the 15% rate in the active control group).\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} Study Number & Risk Ratio (C/P) & Control rate & Placebo rate \\ \\hline Study 1 & 3(!!)4 & 15\\% & 20\\% \\ \\hline Study 2 & 3(!!)4 & 30\\% & 40\\% \\ \\hline Study 3 & 3(!!)4 & 45\\% & 60\\% \\ \\hline Study 4 & 3(!!)4 & 60\\% & 80\\% \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIn this case, where absolute effect sizes vary but risk reductions are reasonably constant, the risk ratio metric provides a better adjustment to the lower event rate in the NI study.\n\nRevisiting the example from section III.E, it was clear in the placebo-controlled trials of streptokinase that the mortality rate in the placebo group was decreasing, so that even if the mortality reduction were constant as a relative reduction, the absolute reduction would decrease and the expected size of the treatment effect (M({}_{1})) would no longer be an absolute 2.1% reduction. The relative risk of mortality (ratio of mortality rates) was therefore used for subsequent thrombol product development programs because thrombol efficacy expressed as the relative mortality rates appeared to be more stable over time as improved standards of care were provided to all patients in a study.\n\nFor the development of tencteplase in the treatment of AMI, evaluation of the relevant historical studies led to the conclusion that the comparator (90 minute infusion of alteplase) would reduce the relative risk of mortality compared to placebo by at least 0.22 (to about 0.78, upper limit of the relative risk confidence interval). The NI margin was chosen, again based upon clinical judgment, so the new drug would retain at least half of the efficacy of the comparator (M({}{1}) = 0.22), i.e., at least 0.11 (M({}{2})). The relative mortality risk of tencteplase compared to placebo should be not greater than 0.89. This provided a value for the limit of the relative risk comparison of tencteplase to alteplase of 1.14 ([tenecteplase/placebo]/[alteplase/placebo] = 0.89/0.78), which had to be excluded by the 95% confidence interval (one-sided in this case) of the ratio of mortality rates in the NI study. The ASSENT II study results provided a 95% one-sided upper limit of relative risk of 1.104, which led to the marketing approval of tencteplase.\n\nThese examples illustrate the importance of understanding how a particular metric will perform. The choice between a relative metric (e.g., risk ratio) and an absolute metric (e.g., a difference in rates) in characterizing the effects of treatments may also be based upon clinical interpretation, medical context, and previous experience with the behavior of the rates of the outcome.\n\nd.   Discounting\n\nOne strategy employed in choosing the margin M({}{1}) for the NI study design is \"discounting\" or reducing the magnitude of the active control's effect that is estimated from the HESDE analysis. Such discounting is done to account for the uncertainties in the assumptions that need to be made in estimating, based on past performance, the effect of the active control in the NI study. This concept of discounting focuses on M({}{1}) determination and is distinct from a clinical judgment that the effect that can be lost on clinical grounds should be some fraction of M({}{1}) (i.e., M({}{2})). As discussed above, there are uncertainties associated with translating the historical effect of the active control (HESDE) to the new situation of the active control NI trial, and it is tempting to deal with that uncertainty in the constancy assumption by discounting the effect (e.g., \"take half\"). Rather than applying \"automatic\" discounting in choosing M({}_{1}), concerns about the active control effect should, to the extent possible:\n\nBe specific\n\nMake use of available data (e.g., magnitude of possible differences in effect in different patient populations, consistency of past studies, and consistency within studies across population subsets)\n\nTake into account factors that reduce the need for a conservative estimate, such as the pharmacologic similarity of the test and control drugs and pharmacodynamic effects of the new drug\n\nA closely related issue is the possible need for adjustment of M({}{1}) to reflect any differences that were observed between the population in the NI study and the historical study. For example, a finding of a smaller effect in women than in men in the historical studies would need to be considered in assessing the validity of M({}{1}) if the NI study had a substantially greater proportion of women than the historical studies. In general, the assessment of the historical data should identify differences in the outcomes for important subgroups so that the statistical analysis plan for the NI study can be designed prospectively to take these factors into account (e.g., through covariate adjustments) or so that the value of M({}_{1}) can be revisited in light of the baseline characteristics of the study population that was enrolled in the NI study.\n\nFixed Margin and Synthesis Methods\n\nConceptually, the conclusion of non-inferiority is a synthesis of information from the NI trial itself and the historical evidence that the comparator in that trial was effective. The historical trials assessed C({}{\\mathrm{h}}-\\mathrm{P}), the effect of the active control compared to placebo. The NI trial assesses T - C({}{\\mathrm{n}}), the effect of the test drug compared to active control. If the outcome for the active control is constant across studies, then C({}{\\mathrm{n}}=\\mathrm{C}{\\mathrm{h}}), and the sum T - C({}{\\mathrm{n}}+\\mathrm{C}{\\mathrm{h}}-\\mathrm{P}=\\mathrm{T}-\\mathrm{P}) represents the effect of the test drug compared to placebo. The indispensable purpose of a NI trial is to show with high confidence that this effect is positive. Additionally, NI trials are usually intended to estimate this effect, at least roughly, in comparison to the historical effect of the active control.\n\nThe historical studies will furnish an estimate of C({}{\\mathrm{h}}-\\mathrm{P}) with an associated standard error SE({}{\\mathrm{H}}). Similarly, the NI study will estimate T - C({}{\\mathrm{n}}) with a standard error SE({}{\\mathrm{N}}). The two estimates are independent, so that the standard error of the sum is given by\n\n[\\sqrt{SE_{H}^{2}+SE_{N}^{2}}.]\n\nNotwithstanding that the interpretation of an NI study is fundamentally a synthesis, we recommend a statistical method, the fixed-margin method, that treats the problem in two separate steps. This approach offers two practical advantages. First, it allows separation of the problem of calculating, justifying, and possibly adjusting the NI margins M({}{1}) and M({}{2}) from the problem of analyzing the NI study. Second, it is equivalent to applying a somewhat larger standard error to the synthesized estimate, which can be seen as an allowance for the possibility of minor deviations from constancy.\n\nThe Fixed Margin Approach\n--------------------\nContext title: Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.123549938201904", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: This example highlights that borrowing from adult data can be done not only for the device group in a clinical study, but also for control groups or reference standard values.\n\n4.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn many cases, a control or comparator is not available for pediatrics but it is available for adults. As illustrated, partial extrapolation can potentially be used in these cases.\n\n4.3 A Hypothetical Example of Partial Extrapolation\n\nSuppose a company wishes to extend an indication to adolescents for their marketed device X to treat a condition Y. The device is approved for use in adults. There are several available adult data sets from the US pre-market application as well as from marketing applications in other regions of the world. The endpoint used in the available studies is identical to the endpoint desired in the adolescent population. However, the adults were followed for eight months, and the FDA recommends following adolescents for at least 12 months. There are no other identified differences between populations with respect to the anticipated effectiveness or safety of the device. Thus, Box C has been answered \"no\". However, full extrapolation is not recommended because the eight-month adult data are not sufficient to serve as a substitute for twelve-month pediatric data.\n\nBased on additional information from studies published in medical journals about how the device performs beyond eight months in adults, the sponsor was able to borrow from the adult studies and use statistical modeling to predict adolescent response at 12 months. The predictive model also incorporated some prospectively collected adolescent data out to 12 months. Thus, the data quality when paired with the statistical model was determined to be sufficient to allow for partial extrapolation. However, with the leveraged adult data the sample size estimated for the adolescent study was smaller than it would have been otherwise. Once the adolescent study is completed, the model will be verified to ensure that assumptions are met and borrowing is indeed appropriate.\n\n4.4 Hypothetical Examples where Extrapolation is not Recommended\n\n4.4.1 Hypothetical example where extrapolation is not recommended because of quality of data\n\nA pre-amendment device is not indicated for pediatric use. When submitting their device's annual report to FDA, the sponsor cites case report studies which the sponsor believes suggest an indication for pediatric use may be appropriate. The disease to be treated is essentially the same in adults and pediatric patients, and the endpoints used to evaluate clinical outcomes are also the same. There are also no apparent expected differences between the pediatric and adult response to device. Therefore, the answer to Box C is \"no.\"\n\nHowever, the adult data available for extrapolation are decades old. Both the practice of medicine and relevant study design considerations have significantly changed. As such, despite the similarities between the adult and pediatric populations, it is likely that FDAwould determine that the adult data in this case are not of sufficient quality for either full or partial extrapolation.\n\n4.4.2 Hypothetical example where extrapolation is not recommended because of relevant differences\n\nConsider a generic device which is indicated for a rare adult disease. A sponsor would like to extend the indication to a pediatric subpopulation because the endpoints between the two groups are similar. The only difference in the response to device intervention relates to how pediatric growth may impact the safety and effectiveness of the device. However, the device may need to be removed or adjusted for growth, which requires surgical intervention and introduces additional risk for pediatric patients. In addition, the anticipated impact of pediatric growth on device safety and effectiveness is largely unknown, and there is limited clinical experience in adults so the data are not sufficient to reliably inform modeling. Partial extrapolation is not feasible because the differences between the adult and pediatric populations cannot be accounted for, clinically or with modeling. Therefore, extrapolation is not recommended in this scenario.\n\n4.5 An Example of an Actual Extrapolation\n\nPatients with systemic, left-sided, congenital heart valve disease pose significant challenges for physicians. There are limited technological solutions available for these patients. Few replacement heart valves are indicated for pediatric patients, and commercially available bioprosthetic valves for aortic and mitral valve replacement may not be available in sizes appropriate for infants and children.\n\nThe clinical impact of congenitally deformed valves is significant and often lifelong. Treatment decisions are almost always impacted by the effects of rapid growth, active lifestyle, and accelerated deterioration of biological prostheses. Pediatric valve replacement is a high-risk procedure involving higher operative mortality, high reoperation rate, and late morbidity compared to adult patients undergoing the same operation.\n\nThe reasons for the higher operative mortality are multiple and complex. Most often, the available prosthesis is too large for the child's anatomy, resulting in delay in referral for surgery. When surgery is undertaken, additional steps are often required to enlarge the site of implantation to accommodate the prosthesis.\n\nClinical studies have routinely been conducted on the adult patient population. However, pediatric patients have typically been excluded from replacement heart valve trials for several reasons, including:\n\nSince pediatric heart valve replacement is a relatively rare surgical procedure, there is a limited patient pool requiring a replacement heart valve, which can lead to prolonged recruitment to achieve required enrollment numbers\n\n5.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPediatric patients often have? complex health histories (many leading to early mortality)\n\nCo-morbidities confound the adverse event profiles for the study, making it very difficult to assess overall safety of the valve\n\nThere are limited valve sizes available\n\nFollowing valve replacement, the pediatric patient continues to grow, ultimately necessitating reoperation and the placement of a larger valve\n\nUniformity of an identifiable patient population is extremely challenging to achieve, again leading to prolonged study recruitment\n\nBelow we trace the pathway to extrapolation of adult data using the decision tree, beginning with effectiveness. First, the disease is identified as being the same for pediatrics as for adults. Additionally, the primary endpoint for effectiveness would be similar in both a pediatric study and adult study (Decision Tree Questions A and B). Therefore, the adult data are considered relevant.\n\nWhile a heart valve for a pediatric patient is implanted in the same location as for an adult, the duration of implantation of a particular size will be shorter for a pediatric patient due to normal pediatric patient growth. This could influence the effectiveness of the device for pediatric use. Therefore, the answer to question #1 in Box C is \"yes\". Furthermore, one of the most important patient characteristics unique to pediatrics is that the patient continues to grow after valve replacement, necessitating additional operations to implant larger valves. This difference can also influence effectiveness. Question #3 is also answered yes because pediatric patient growth could impact effectiveness of the heart valve. Therefore, there are some differences related to effectiveness.\n\nHowever, such differences can be explained clinically as associated with valve size rather than age per se. Additionally, there is extensive relevant adult data of sufficient quality available for the sizes of interest and the different positions (aortic, mitral) to inform a statistical model to account for the differences. It was thus possible to incorporate a clinical relationship between valve size, position and device effectiveness into a statistical model that could be used for extrapolation, the data from which could meet the threshold for valid scientific evidence and be used to support an effectiveness determination. Therefore, a partial extrapolation was considered plausible for effectiveness. FDA agreed that a sample size of 15 pediatric patients per size per position (aortic, mitral), when combined with the borrowed adult data, could potentially suffice for demonstrating clinical effectiveness of the device for the proposed pediatric indication.\n\nIn assessing whether the existing data could be leveraged to extrapolate for safety, the primary difference with pediatric device use is that patient growth after valve replacement necessitates additional operations to implant larger valves. As such, the answer to question #2 in Box C would be \"yes\". This exposes pediatric patients to additional operations, which pose an incremental risk. Therefore, safety data adequate to evaluate this incremental risk for pediatric patients was necessary. FDA concluded thatthe number of pediatric patients that would be prospectively enrolled to confirm effectiveness would be sufficient to evaluate safety as well. In addition, a post-approval study was recommended to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of the device in pediatric patients.\n\nThis example illustrates how available relevant adult clinical data were leveraged to bolster new pediatric data in a manner that meets the threshold for valid scientific evidence. When considered in conjunction with safety evidence that had already been compiled (e.g., preclinical testing, engineering models, biocompatibility.) and the data derived from prospective pediatric studies, appropriate partial extrapolation was used to support a safety and effectiveness determination for new pediatric heart valves.\n\nAppendix B: Details on Statistical Modeling for Extrapolation\n--------------------\nContext title: Leveraging Existing Clinical Data for Extrapolation to Pediatric Uses of Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.275391578674316"], "Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA welcomes the opportunity to provide informal advice and feedback during the development of the pivotal study design through the pre-submission process.

See 21 CFR 312.3 and 812.3(i). The clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under the investigator\u2019s care. See 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.100. For further information, refer to \u201cGuidance for Industry: Investigator Responsibilities \u2014 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects\u201d: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM187772.pdf.\n\nFootnote 3: See generally 21 CFR part 54 for requirements related to financial disclosures by clinical investigators and \u201cGuidance for Industry - Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\u201d: http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm.\n\nThe FDA investigator also may audit the study data by comparing the data filed with the agency or the sponsor, if available, with records related to the clinical investigation. Such records may include the case report forms and supporting source documentation including signed and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the physician, the subject's hospital chart(s), and the nurses' notes. These records may be in hard copy and/or an electronic format. For electronic records and/or electronic signatures, the FDA investigator may gather information to determine whether 21 CFR part 11 requirements have been met.4FDA may also examine subjects' medical records that are part of the clinical investigation and predate the study to verify whether the condition under study was in fact diagnosed, the study eligibility criteria were met, and whether the subject received any potentially interfering medication prohibited by the protocol. The FDA investigator may also review subjects' records covering a period after completion of study-related activities to determine if there was proper follow-up as outlined in the protocol, and if the clinical investigator submitted all reportable adverse events (including all clinical signs and symptoms). See 21 CFR 312.64(b) and 812.150(a). For more information about the procedures FDA uses during inspections of clinical investigator sites, see FDA's Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM), Bioresearch Monitoring, Clinical Investigators and Sponsor-Investigators, Program 7348.811.5\n\nFootnote 5: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/EnforcementActions/BioresearchMonitoring/ucm133773.pdf.\n\nV International Inspections\n\nFDA's inspection of clinical investigators is not limited to the United States (U.S.). International inspections are generally conducted when the studies are part of a marketing application submitted to FDA and provide data critical to decision-making on product approval. See FDA's CPGM, Program 7348.811, \"Clinical Investigators and Sponsor-Investigators.\"6 Such assignments include studies that are conducted under an FDA investigational new drug application (IND), as well as studies at non-U.S. sites that are not conducted under an IND or under an investigational device exemption (IDE).\n\nFootnote 6: Ibid.\n\nStudies Involving Investigational Drugs and Biologies\n\nFDA inspects clinical investigators conducting foreign trials, either under an IND or in support of an IND, a new drug application (NDA) or a biologics license application (BLA). Although sponsors of clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. are not required to file an IND, sponsors submitting foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND to FDA must comply with requirements in 21 CFR 312.120. If a clinical investigator conducts a study under an IND outside of the U.S., the clinical investigator is subject to FDA regulations, including applicable provisions in 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 312. FDA validates the authenticity and accuracy of data and confirms compliance during an inspection, which is performed under the circumstances listed above in section III.\n\nWhen FDA considers whether to accept non-U.S., non-IND clinical studies in support of an IND, NDA, or BLA, an FDA inspection may help in determining whether the study was conducted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. Specifically, the inspection will evaluate whether the following criteria are met:\n\nThe study is well-designed and well-conducted.\n\nThe study is conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), which is defined as a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\n\nThe study has been reviewed and approved (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) prior to study initiation, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and the freely given and documented informed consent of the subject (or the subject's legally authorized representative if the subject is unable to provide consent) prior to any study-specific procedures.\n\nStudies Involving Investigational Devices\n\nFDA's inspection of clinical investigators conducting foreign trials includes device trials in support of a premarket approval application (PMA) or a premarket notification (510(k)) submission.\n\nFor device studies conducted outside the U.S., FDA will accept research in support of a PMA, but which has not been conducted under an IDE, if certain conditions are met. An FDA inspection may help in determining whether the study was conducted in accordance with 21 CFR 814.15. Specifically, the inspection will evaluate whether the following criteria are met:\n\nthe data are valid; and\n\nthe studies are conducted in conformance with the \"Declaration of Helsinki,\"7 or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords greater protection to the human subjects. FDA validates the authenticity and accuracy of data and confirms compliance during an inspection, which is performed under the circumstances listed above in section III. The FDA investigator may request documentation as to whether the study was conducted under the laws and regulations of the non-U.S. country and/or the Declaration of Helsinki, whichever accords greater protection to human subjects.\n\nFootnote 7: 21 CFR part 814 refers to the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1983. There have been subsequent revisions of the Declaration, but FDA has not officially adopted subsequent versions.\n\nVI What happens after an inspection?\n\nAt the end of an inspection, the FDA investigator conducts an exit interview with the clinical investigator or his/her representative. At this interview, the FDA investigator who conducted the inspection reviews and discusses the findings from the inspection and, if deficiencies were found, issues a written Form FDA 483 (Inspectional Observations; 483) to the clinical investigator or his/her representative. The 483 describes any inspectional observations that, in the opinion of the FDA investigator conducting the inspection, represent deviations from applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nSome common deficiencies that have been observed by FDA investigators during a clinical investigator inspection include:* failure to follow the investigational plan and signed investigator statement/agreement (e.g., failure to conduct or supervise the study in accordance with the relevant, current protocol(s)). See 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.110(b).\n* protocol deviations (e.g., failure to appropriately document and report any medically necessary protocol deviations). See 21 CFR 312.66 and 812.150(a)(4).\n* inadequate recordkeeping. See 21 CFR 312.62 and 812.140(a).\n* inadequate accountability for the investigational product. See 21 CFR 312.62(a) and 812.140(a)(2).\n* inadequate subject protection, including informed consent issues. See 21 CFR part 50, 312.60, and 812.100.\n\nThe clinical investigator may respond to the 483 observations orally during the exit interview and/or respond in writing after the inspection. If the clinical investigator chooses to respond in writing to the deficiencies listed on the 483, the response should be directed to the FDA District Office listed in the upper left corner of the 483.8 (A list of FDA District Offices is also posted on FDA's website (http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/ucm124008.htm)).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Inspections of Clinical Investigators Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.951815128326416", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Types of Studies Not Addressed in this Guidance\n\nAlthough this guidance does not address the following kinds of studies, some principles discussed herein are applicable to many of them:\n\nNon-clinical studies (e.g., bench, animal or measurement studies and, for in vitro diagnostic devices, analytical validation studies);\n\nHumanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Regulation: Questions and Answers, at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucml110194.htm, for detailed information.\n\nPre-market feasibility clinical studies, or other pre-market clinical studies that are not part of the pivotal stage;\n\nStudies to establish the clinical validity of companion diagnostic devices (i.e., in vitro diagnostic tests that provide essential information for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product). Clinical development programs for companion diagnostic devices are typically part of the clinical development programs of the corresponding therapeutic products;\n\nPost-market clinical studies. Though the need for post-market clinical studies might arise from interpretation of pre-market clinical results, post-market studies do not drive the initial determination of safety and effectiveness, and their design is not addressed in this guidance. However, the principles discussed in this guidance may be useful in designing such studies;\n\nStudies of products regulated by CBER that require an Investigational New Drug application and Biologics License Application, such as donor screening tests, are not included in the scope of the guidance.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAlthough this guidance is developed primarily for clinical studies used to support PMAs, the recommendations of this guidance may also be used in designing clinical studies used to support some 510(k) and de novo submissions with clinical data when applicable.\n\n3 Regulatory Framework for Level of Evidence and Study Design\n\nClinical studies of medical devices must conform to certain legal requirements. This section describes the:\n\nRegulatory framework applicable to the design of clinical studies that support pre-market submissions for medical devices;\n\nStatutory standard for approval of a PMA;\n\nRegulatory requirements that apply to clinical and other data used to meet the statutory standard for approval of a PMA;\n\nHow FDA evaluates the data to assess the risks and benefits of a device;\n\nBasic information about Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications; and\n\nFDA's current thinking on good regulatory practice as identified in the least burdensome concept.\n\nThis guidance reflects the Agency's consideration of standards for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Related international documents include the \"Declaration of Helsinki\" and are further explained in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 14155:2011, Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects - Good clinical practice and through the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance. FDA regulations under 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and 812 articulate good clinical practice (GCP) requirements applicable to clinical investigations of medical devices. In addition, FDA guidance documents describe FDA's current thinking on GCP and the conduct of clinical studies.3 Compliance with GCP, as applicable to medical devices, protects the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects, ensures appropriate scientific conduct of the clinical investigation and the credibility of the results, defines the responsibilities of the sponsor and the clinical investigator, and assists sponsors, investigators, institutional review boards (IRBs), other ethics committees, regulatory authorities, and other bodies involved in the development and review of medical devices.\n\nFootnote 3: A list of FDA\u2019s GCP guidance documents is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122046.htm.\n\nIf a clinical investigation of a device is conducted in the United States it must comply with the applicable regulations found in 21 CFR Part 56 (IRBs), Part 50 (informed consent), and Part 812 (investigation device exemption (IDE)). If the clinical investigation of the device is conductedoutside of the United States, submitted in support of a PMA, and conducted under an IDE, the study shall comply with 21 CFR Part 812. 21 CFR 814.15(a). If a clinical investigation of a device is conducted completely outside the United States and not conducted under an IDE, FDA will accept studies submitted in support of a PMA, if the data are valid and the investigator has conducted the studies in conformance with the \"Declaration of Helsinki\" or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever accords greater protection to the human subjects, in accordance with 21 CFR 814.15. A PMA based solely on foreign clinical data may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the United States population and medical practice; the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; if an inspection is needed, FDA can validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means; and the application otherwise meets the criteria for approval. 21 CFR 814.15(d). The sponsor must be able to show that the foreign clinical data are adequate to support approval of the device in the United States, under applicable standards. Section 569B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or the Act). We encourage you to meet with FDA in a Pre-Submission meeting if you intend to seek approval based on foreign data, or based on a combination of foreign and U.S. data.\n\nThe Statutory Standard for Approval of a PMA: Reasonable Assurance of Safety and Effectiveness\n\nAs indicated by Sections 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, a PMA must provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. FD&C Act Section 513(a)(2) states:\n\n[T]he safety and effectiveness of a device are to be determined:--\n\n(A) with respect to the persons for whose use the device is represented or intended,\n\n(B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the\n\nlabeling of the device, and\n\n(C) weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any\n\nprobable risk of injury or illness from such use.\n\nIn addition, FDA has, through regulation, interpreted the statutory standard for approval of a PMA as follows:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(d)(1). There is reasonable assurance that a device is safe when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that the probable benefits to health from use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions and warnings against unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks. The valid scientific evidence used to determine the safety of a device shall adequately\n\ndemonstrate the absence of unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use.\n\n_21 CFR 860.7(e)(1). There is reasonable assurance that a device is effective when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that in a significant portion of the target population, the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use, will provide clinically significant results._These statutory and regulatory provisions specify that a finding of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness must be supported by data relevant to the target population, and evaluated in light of the device labeling. Further, a determination of whether the standard of approval for a PMA has been met is based on balancing probable benefit to health with probable risk.\n\nValid Scientific Evidence\n\nThe regulations state that the safety and effectiveness of a device will be determined on the basis of valid scientific evidence. 21 CFR 860.7(c)(1). Valid scientific evidence is defined through regulation as follows:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(c)(2) Valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness. Such information may be considered, however, in identifying a device the safety and effectiveness of which is questionable.\n\nFDA regulations also consider which types of evidence support reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(d)(2) Among the types of evidence that may be required, when appropriate, to determine that there is reasonable assurance that a device is safe are investigations using laboratory animals, investigations involving human subjects, and nonclinical investigations including in vitro studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.2234416007995605", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 35: See pages 7-8 of FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Industry Investigator Responsibilities \u2013 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigator-responsibilities-protecting-rights-safety-and-welfare-study-subjects.\n\nIf contact information changes during the clinical investigation, then the new contact information must be provided to the subject (21 CFR 50.25(a)(7)). This may be done through a variety of ways, for example, a card providing the relevant contact information for the clinical investigation may be given to the subject during a visit or mailed to the subject in an envelope to protect the subject's privacy.\nA statement that participation is voluntary, that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and that the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. (21 CFR 50.25(a)(8))\n\nThis element requires that subjects be informed that they may decline to take part in the clinical investigation or may stop participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which subjects are entitled (21 CFR 50.25(a)(8)). Language that limits the subject's right to decline to participate or withdraw from the clinical investigation must not be used. If special procedures should be followed for the subject to withdraw from the clinical investigation, the consent process must outline and explain the procedures (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4); see section III.C.4, \"Consequences of Subject's Decision to Withdraw\"). Written withdrawal from the study by the subject is not a requirement. When possible, the site staff should document the withdrawal and the date it occurred. Note, when a subject withdraws from a study conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE), the data collected on the subject to the point of withdrawal remains part of the study database and may not be removed.36\n\nFootnote 36: See, \u201cGuidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs; Data Retention When Subjects Withdraw from FDA-Regulated Clinical Trials,\u201d at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/data-retention-when-subjects-withdraw-fda-regulated-clinical-trials.\n\nAppendix C Additional Elements of Informed Consent\n\nFDA regulations identify six additional elements of informed consent to be provided to each subject, when appropriate. (21 CFR 50.25(b))\n\n(b) Additional elements of informed consent. When appropriate, one or more of the following elements of information shall also be provided to each subject:\n\nThe following elements are appropriate to provide to prospective subjects when the IRB determines the information is material to prospective subjects' decisions to participate:\n\n1. Unforeseeable Risks\n\nA statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable. (21 CFR 50.25(b)(1))\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf subjects might incur additional expense as a result of taking part in the clinical investigation, the consent process must explain the added costs (21 CFR 50.25(b)(3)). FDA recommends that any additional cost that may be charged to the subject, the subject's insurance, or other reimbursement mechanism be explained as part of the informed consent process. Subjects should be made aware that insurance or other reimbursement mechanisms might not fund the medical care they receive as a result of participating in a clinical investigation even when the care is the standard care they would otherwise receive if not participating in a clinical investigation.38\n\nFootnote 38: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act added section 2709 to the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-8). Among other things, this provision prohibits a group health plan or health insurance issuer in the group and individual health insurance market from denying certain individuals\u2019 participation in certain clinical trials and from denying or limiting coverage of routine patient costs for items or services furnished in connection with participation in such trials.\n\nAdditionally, insurance or other forms of reimbursement might not pay for care related to complications or injuries arising from participation in a clinical investigation (see section3.6, \"Compensation and Medical Treatments in Event of Injury\"). If the subject's insurance is charged and there are deductibles or copayments, the subject should be informed of whether they will be responsible for these costs. If funds will be available to cover costs not covered by insurance or other forms of reimbursement, the consent form should describe how these funds will be made available to subjects or direct subjects on how to obtain further information. Because these issues may be complex, it may be appropriate to refer the subject to a knowledgeable financial counselor or reimbursement specialist to explain the costs and the insurance and reimbursement issues prior to signing the consent form.\n\nIn some cases, the cost of an investigational product may be charged to the subject. In clinical investigations involving investigational devices, the sponsor is permitted to recover the costs of research, development, manufacture, and handling of investigational devices (see 21 CFR 812.7(b)). FDA may authorize sponsors in certain clinical investigations of drugs to recover the direct costs of making the investigational drug available, such as costs to manufacture, ship, and handle (e.g., store) the drug (see 21 CFR 312.8).39 When these costs are passed to the subject, the consent process must identify these costs (21 CFR 50.25(b)(3)).\n\nFootnote 39: See \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Charging for Investigational Products,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/charging-investigational-products, and \u201cGuidance for Industry, Charging for Investigational Drugs Under an IND \u2013 Questions and Answers,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/charging-investigational-drug-under-ind-questions-and-answers. Also, sponsors of expanded access INDs and treatment protocols that meet certain requirements may recover other costs than these direct costs. See 21 CFR 312.8(d)(2).\n\nBeyond the costs directly related to participation in the research, it may be appropriate to identify additional costs that may be incurred, such as any costs associated with participation in the clinical investigation, e.g., time off from work, child or elder care, or transportation costs. To aid the prospective subject in understanding these additional costs, the consent process should describe the protocol requirements in sufficient detail (e.g., number and duration of study site visits and procedures) to enable subjects to appreciate how much time they may need to take away from work, child care, or elder care. Prospective subjects should be made aware of direct and indirect costs of participation and informed as to what extent these costs will be covered by the sponsor versus paid by the subject (see sectionIII.1.2, \"Coercion and Undue Influence\").\n\niv.1.4 Consequences of Subject's Decision to Withdraw\n\nThe consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject. (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4))\n\nWhen appropriate, the consent process must describe the consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the clinical investigation and the procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4)). For example, when withdrawal from a clinical investigation may adversely affect the subject, the informed consent process must explain the withdrawal procedures that are recommended in order to ensure the subject's safety and should specifically state why the withdrawal procedures are important to the subject's welfare. For some clinical investigations, an intervention should be withdrawn gradually, or the investigator may recommend follow-up to ensure the subject's safety when an investigational intervention is prematurely terminated due to a subject's withdrawal. In these cases, the consent process must explicitly inform the subject of the potential adverse effects of premature termination of the investigational intervention. Prospective subjects should be made aware of the number of visits and approximate time required for participation in the study to help them determine if they are able to make the commitment to complete the study. When appropriate, it may be reasonable to counsel prospective subjects that they should not participate in the trial if they do not foresee staying in the study. If applicable, the consent process must explain whether a subject who withdraws early will receive future study payments.40 The subject should also be informed as to how the data that have already been collected will be handled (see also sectionIII.2.8, \"Voluntary Participation\").\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Significant New Findings to Subjects\n\nA statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject.

For additional guidance, see the discussion under the section entitled \"Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports.\")\n\n(6) Any further information requested by FDA or the IRB about any aspect of the investigation.\n\nb. To the Sponsor:\n\n(1) Withdrawal of IRB approval of the investigator's part of an investigation. (Due within 5 working days of such action).\n\n6. Investigational Device Distribution and Tracking\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit an investigator from providing an investigational device to any person not authorized to receive it (21 CFR 812.110(c)). The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor the shipping, use, and final disposal of the device(s). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). Investigators must also maintain complete, current and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of investigational devices (21 CFR 812.140(a)(2)). Specific investigator recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a).\n\n7. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n8. Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports\n\nThe IDE regulations do not specify the content of the annual progress or final reports. With respect to reports to the IRB, the IRB itself may specify what information it wishes to be included in these reports. Because FDA does require the information listed below, it is suggested that, at a minimum, the annual progress and final reports to the sponsor and the IRB also include the following items:\n\na. IDE number\n\nb. Device name\n\nc. Indications for use\n\nd. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan\n\ne. Number of investigators and investigational sites\n\nf. Number of subjects enrolled\n\ng. Number of devices received, used, and the final disposition of unused devices\n\nh. Brief summary of results and conclusions\n\ni.

This sequence allows prospective subjects to understand how the research differs from the care they might otherwise receive. The description of the clinical investigation should identify tests or procedures required by the protocol that would not be part of their care outside of the research; for example, drawing blood samples for a pharmacokinetic study. Note that all experimental procedures must be identified as such (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). Procedures related solely to research must be explained (for example, protocol-driven versus individualized dosing, randomized assignment to treatment, blinding of subject and investigator, and receipt of placebo if the study is placebo-controlled) (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). In some cases, tests or procedures that would be considered part of usual clinical care will not be performed on study participants; when applicable, this should be discussed as part of the informed consent process.\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe description of the clinical investigation must describe the test article (e.g., the investigational product under study) and, if used in the study, the control (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). The description should include relevant information on what is known about both the test article and the control. For example, the description should indicate whether the test article is approved or cleared24 for marketing and describe the use(s) for which it has been approved or cleared. The description should also provide relevant information about any control used in the study: for example, whether the control is FDA approved or cleared for marketing, considered a medically recognized standard of care25, or is a placebo (including an explanation of what a placebo is). The information provided about the test article and control should include appropriate and reliable information about the potential benefits and risks of each, to the extent such information is available. For clinical investigations involving the comparison of an investigational product to one or more standards of care, it may be acceptable to describe the most common risks and benefits of the standard(s) of care in the consent form and provide additional information that may be relevant to a particular subject as part of the consent discussion, if appropriate.\n\nFootnote 24: For purposes of this guidance, when \u201capproved or cleared\u201d is used in discussing devices, the terms refer to FDA permitting the marketing of a device via the premarket approval, premarket notification (510(k)), De Novo classification, or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) pathways.\n\nFootnote 25: For the purposes of this guidance only, FDA generally would consider a medically recognized standard of care to be one evidenced by publication in a peer reviewed journal as a generally recognized standard of care or recognition by a professional medical society (e.g., in a clinical guideline).\n\nThe consent process should outline what the subject's participation will involve in order to comply with the protocol, for example, the number of clinic visits, maintenance of diaries, and medical or dietary restrictions (including the need to avoid specific medications or activities, such as participation in other clinical investigations26). If describing every procedure would make the consent form too lengthy or detailed, FDA recommends providing the general procedures in the consent form with an addendum describing the details of the study procedures to be performed at each visit. It may be helpful to provide a chart outlining what happens at each study visit to simplify the consent form and assist the prospective subject in understanding what participation in the clinical investigation will involve. FDA believes that removing procedural details from the consent form will reduce its length, enhance its readability, and allow the consent document to focus on content related to the risks and anticipated benefits, if any.\n\nFootnote 26: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #11, \u201cCan a subject participate in more than one clinical investigation simultaneously?\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process must clearly describe the expected duration of the subject's participation in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)), which includes their active participation as well aslong-term follow-up, if appropriate. Prospective subjects must be informed of the procedures that will occur during such follow-up (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)), which may be provided in a chart as described above.\n\niv.1.2 Risks and Discomforts\n\nA description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomorts to the subject. (21 CFR 50.25(a)(2))\n\nThe informed consent process must describe the reasonably foreseeable risks or discomorts to the subject. This includes risks or discomorts of tests, interventions and procedures required by the protocol (including protocol-specified standard medical procedures, exams, and tests), with a particular focus on those that carry significant risk of morbidity or mortality. Possible risks or discomorts due to changes to a subject's medical care (e.g., by changing the subject's stable medication regimen or by stopping the subject's current treatment and randomizing them to either the investigational drug or placebo) should also be addressed. Where relevant, participants should also be made aware of the possibility of unintended disclosures of private information and be provided with an explanation of measures to protect a subject's privacy and data, and limitations to those measures.27 The explanation of potential risks of the test article and control, if any, and an assessment of the likelihood of these risks occurring should be based on reliable and accurate information presented in the protocol, investigator's brochure, labeling, and/or previous research reports. Reasonably foreseeable discomorts to the subject must also be described (21 CFR 50.25(a)(2)). For example, the consent form should disclose that the subject may be uncomfortable having to stay in one position or experience claustrophobia-like symptoms during an MRI. For clinical investigations involving the comparison of an investigational product to one or more standards of care, it may be acceptable to describe the more common and significant risks and discomorts of the standard of care in the informed consent form and provide additional risk information, as appropriate, as part of the consent discussion.\n\nFootnote 27: Note, 21 CFR 56.111(a)(7) requires IRBs to determine, where appropriate, that there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.\n\nAny reasonably foreseeable risks or discomorts to the subject need to be described in the informed consent form; however, it is not necessary to describe all possible risks, especially if doing so could make the form overwhelming for subjects to read. Information on risks that are more likely to occur and those that are serious should be described so that prospective subjects can understand the nature of the risk. The discussion may include information on whether a risk is reversible, and the probability of the risk based on existing data. Information on what may be done to mitigate serious risks, and risks and discomorts more likely to occur, should also be considered for inclusion.\n\nThe description should not understate the probability and magnitude of the reasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts. If applicable, the consent document should include a description of the reasonably foreseeable risks to the subject, but also the potential for risk to \"others\" (for example, radiation therapy where close proximity to subjects post-procedure may create some risk to others). In situations where there may be a risk to others, efforts to mitigate the potential risk (e.g., using separate bathrooms) may be included in the consent document or provided in a separate document and given to the subject during the consent discussion.\n\nWhen appropriate, a statement must be included that a particular treatment or procedure may involve currently unforeseeable risks to the subject (or to the subject's embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) (21 CFR 50.25(b)(1); see section III.C.1, \"Unforeseeable Risks\"). If unanticipated risks are reported during the investigation, the informed consent discussion and documents may need to be updated with the additional risks (21 CFR 50.25(a)(2); see Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nii.3.3 Benefits\n\nA description of any benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research. (21 CFR 50.25(a)(3))\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.220274448394775"], "From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Cotains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ7: How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n\nA7: Where alternate tools are not available, insufficient, or otherwise will not satisfy the need for an inspection, FDA will use a risk-based approach to prioritize inspections, which includes consideration for (a) how product availability could impact public health; (b) investigator safety; and (c) travel restrictions and/or advisories associated with the location of the facility or site (e.g., country or region/state/province within the country, U.S. state, county, or territory). FDA will also seek to minimize, though not necessarily avoid, missing additional application goal dates due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 public health emergency. These objectives will also be balanced with the effort to reduce any backlog of assigned inspections.\n\nAppendix B Manufacturing and Supply Chain Change Requests\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.\n\nQ8: How do I add or change a facility in my application in response to supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA8: Refer to the established guidance documents listed in section V. References, for changing or adding a facility to your application.\n\nIf your marketing application19 relates to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 or to a drug that is on FDA's drug shortage list,20 the cover letter to the submission should clearly state \"Priority Review Requested\" and should include information to support your priority review designation request. If the product could enter, or is currently in drug shortage, also contact CDER DRUG SHORTAGES (DRUGSHORTAGES(rFDA.HHS.GOV). See https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/drug-shortages for more information. For products regulated by CBER, contact cbershortage(r)fda.hhs.gov. Except as described above, FDA intends to continue following the procedures outlined in relevant Manuals of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) and Standard Operating Procedures and Policies (SOPPs).21\n\nQ9: What data are required to support manufacturing process or facility changes needed to address disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA9: Refer to the Agency's existing guidance documents on making changes to an approved marketing application, as well as scale-up and postapproval change guidance documents for specific dosage forms (see section V. References). Should circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic warrant atypical or flexible submission strategies, for CDER-regulated products, contact CDER-OPQ-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov; for CBER-regulated products, contact the office responsible for the product's regulation for further assistance.\n\nQ10: How can the implementation of postapproval manufacturing changes to an ANDA, NDA, or BLA for products needed during the COVID-19 pandemic be accelerated?\n\nA10: FDA is using multiple tools to facilitate implementation of manufacturing changes such as risk-based reduction in supplement reporting categories and flexible assessment practices.\n\nConsistent with FDA's regulations for marketing applications related to postapproval chemistry, manufacturing, and controls changes, FDA may consider available information and approaches to mitigate the risk to product quality associated with the change to support a reporting category for certain supplements that is lower than what otherwise would be most suitable (if such information and risk-mitigation approaches were not provided). During this public health emergency, FDA is willing to consider requests from applicants to submit certain changes using a lower reporting category based on such risk-mitigation information for marketing applications related to products in shortage or intended to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent COVID-19.\n\nBefore submitting a supplement with a lower reporting category, applicants should contact FDA for feedback and concurrence. For CDER-regulated products, applicants should contact CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. For CBER-regulated products, applicants should contact the office responsible for the product's regulation.\n\nIf the product could enter, or is currently in, drug shortage, include CDER DRUG SHORTAGES (DRUGSHORTAGES((\\underline{\\text{DRUGSHORTAGES}})@FDA.HHS.GOV) for products regulated by CDER and cbershortage@fda.hhs.gov for products regulated by CBER.\n\nApplicants wishing to request a lower supplement reporting category should clearly provide (1) their rationale, (2) supporting information, and (3) risk-mitigation approaches, because this information is needed to consider a reduction in reporting category.\n\nFDA may additionally implement flexible assessment practices such as expediting assessment of supplements, adjusting submission data requirements as part of a risk-benefit assessment, and using additional tools when determining the need for inspections.\n\nCan I submit an application if it includes facilities in regions that are impacted by COVID-19-related travel restrictions?\n\nYes. Reference in an application to a facility in a region impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions does not preclude submission to FDA.\n\nIV For Additional Information\n\nFor additional questions about manufacturing and supply chain changes, contact CDER-OPO-Inquiries_a_fda.hhs.gov, or for CBER, contact the office responsible for the product's regulation. Include \"COVID-19 inquiry\" in the subject line of the email.\n\nV References [22, 23, 24] Draft and Final Guidances\n\n[1]Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products (July 1997)\n\n[2]Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products (July 1997)\n\n[3]Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers (January 2001)\n\n[4]Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004)\n\n[5]CMC Postapproval Manufacturing Changes To Be Documented in Annual Reports (March 2014)\n\n[6]Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products: Human Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion or for Further Manufacture (December 2014)\n\n[7]CMC Postapproval Manufacturing Changes for Specified Biological Products To Be Documented in Annual Reports (August 2017)25_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application: Certain Biological Products (December 2017)26 Footnote 26: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nRemote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021)\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes Guidances\n\nImmediate Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (November 1995)\n\nSUPAC-IR: Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance (February 1997)\n\nNonsterile Semisolid Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Release Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (May 1997)\n\nSUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (September 1997)\n\nSUPAC: Manufacturing Equipment Addendum (December 2014)\n\nManual of Policies and Procedures\n\nMAPP 5240.3 Rev. 5 Prioritization of the Review of Original ANDAs, Amendments, and Supplements\n\nMAPP 5310.3 Rev. 1 Requests for Expedited Review of New Drug Application and Biologics License Application Prior Approval Supplements Submitted for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes\n\nStandard Operating Procedures and Policies\n\nSOPP 8401 Administrative Processing of Original Biologics License Applications (BL4) and New Drug Applications (NDA)\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.641761302947998", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA's use of alternate tools, including a firm's responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle.

For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n\nA2: FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is \"mission-critical\" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities \"in advance of or in lieu of\" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA\u2019s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm's previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records \"in advance of or in lieu of\" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested \"in advance of or in lieu of\" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA's use of alternate tools, including a firm's responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2061554193496704", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 82: See section 564(e) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix E Quality System considerations\n\nFDA recognizes that there may be situations that raise unique compliance considerations, particularly regarding QS requirements. For example, non-traditional device manufacturers that previously operated under different quality standards or requirements may face challenges that take more time to address in transitioning to a system that fully complies with 21 CFR Part 820. FDA intends to take such considerations into account when making case-by-case compliance and enforcement decisions. Some manufacturers who intend to continue distributing their devices after the EUA termination date may choose to request an exemption or variance from a device QS requirement as outlined in 21 CFR 820.1(e) and section 520(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. Any such exemption or variance should be requested within 90 days of publication of the advance notice of termination of the EUA declaration pertaining to the device at issue to help ensure FDA considers your request in time.\n\nAppendix F Laboratory developed tests (LDTs)\n\nFor laboratory developed tests (LDTs)83 in general, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion, meaning that FDA generally does not exercise its authority to enforce the regulatory requirements for these devices, although it maintains that authority. FDA has not applied this general enforcement discretion approach to, among other LDTs, those used for declared emergencies under section 564 of the FD&C Act. As such, following termination of the EUAdeclaration for COVID-19 IVDs,84 FDA intends to have the same enforcement approach for COVID-19 LDTs as it does for other LDTs.\n\nFootnote 84: HHS declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 (issued February 4, 2020 (85 FR 7316) and amended March 15, 2023 (88 FR 16644)).\n\nVI Examples\n\nThe following hypotheticals are intended to illustrate the transition policy outlined above. To exemplify the timeline of the Transition Implementation Plan outlined in this section (Section VI. of this guidance), for purposes of the examples, FDA set the hypothetical advance notice of termination date for the EUA declaration pertaining to the device at issue as July 1 in Year 1, and the EUA termination date as January 1 in Year 2. This date is not intended to propose an actual advance notice of termination or EUA termination date; it is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Note that these generalized examples do not account for every possible detail, risk, or consideration a manufacturer should evaluate or that may be relevant to FDA decisions regarding a particular device.\n\nExample 1\n\nA single-use surgical mask that is intended for use in healthcare settings by healthcare personnel as personal protective equipment to provide a physical barrier to fluids and particulate materials was authorized for emergency use under an umbrella EUA for surgical masks.85 The manufacturer does not intend to continue distributing the surgical mask after the EUA is no longer in effect.\n\nFootnote 85: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-eaus/surgicalmasks.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. After July 1, the manufacturer continues to distribute the surgical masks and continues to comply with all conditions of authorization.\n\nOn the EUA termination date (January 1), the relevant EUA declaration is terminated and the umbrella EUA is no longer in effect. On January 1, the manufacturer ceases distribution of the surgical mask. Before January 1, the manufacturer had recently sold surgical masks directly to retailers and device distributors. Some of the surgical masks are in transit to these customers, and others are being held in device distributors' warehouses in the U.S.\n\nThe policies included in this guidance relate to the following actions by the device manufacturer and others:\n\nThe surgical masks in transit or in device distributors' warehouses remain distributed (they were already distributed by the EUA termination date), and they are used by the end user prior to their expiration date.\n\nIf on January 1, some of the surgical masks are in the manufacturer's possession, the surgical masks in the manufacturer's possession are not subsequently distributed (they were not already distributed by the EUA termination date).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe manufacturer does not update the labeling of the already distributed surgical masks (they are single-use, non-life-supporting/non-life-sustaining devices).\n\nUser exhaustion of already distributed surgical masks is described in Section V.C. of this guidance.\n\nEven after the cessation of distribution, the manufacturer continues to submit any adverse event reports of which it becomes aware to FDA consistent with 21 CFR Part 803.\n\nExample 2\n\nA continuous ventilator was authorized under the umbrella EUA for ventilators and ventilator accessories86 to support patients who develop respiratory distress due to COVID-19.\n\nFootnote 86: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/ventilators-and-ventilator-accessories-cua.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. Before August 1, to help FDA plan for transition-related premarket review activities, the manufacturer submits an \"EUA report\" to the CDRH Document Control Center with \"Attention: Notification of Intent\" on the cover letter of the submission to inform FDA that it does not intend to pursue marketing authorization. This EUA report includes the information outlined in Section V.A. of this guidance, which includes the manufacturer's plans to have already distributed ventilators remain distributed.\n\nOn the EUA termination date (January 1), the relevant EUA declaration is terminated and the umbrella EUA is no longer in effect. On January 1, the manufacturer ceases distribution of the ventilator. FDA does not intend to object if the manufacturer implements a plan (that was included in the Notification of Intent) for the already distributed ventilators to remain distributed (e.g., ventilators in device distributors' warehouses), including ventilators in the possession of end users (e.g., ventilators in healthcare facilities). As part of the plan, the manufacturer interacts with affected stakeholders, such as healthcare facilities, to determine the stakeholders' interest in keeping distributed ventilators. The ventilator manufacturer updates the electronic labeling as outlined in Section V.C. of this guidance, and emails a copy of the electronic labeling to affected stakeholders that have expressed an interest in keeping the ventilators.\n\nThe policies included in this guidance relate to the following actions by the device manufacturer and others:\n\nThe already distributed ventilators are not used.\n\nShould healthcare facilities wish to retain the ventilator that lacks FDA clearance, approval, or authorization for use in the future, the future use of the device would be subject to the regulatory requirements of any future authorization, including marketing authorization or EUA.\n\nFor governmental stockpilers that wish to retain a device that lacks requisite FDA clearance, approval, or authorization for use in the future, FDA recommends engaging with the Agency to discuss the public health need for future deployment and/or use of the device in specific circumstances (e.g., regional natural disaster, localized disease outbreaks).\n\nEven after the cessation of distribution, the manufacturer continues to submit any adverse event reports of which it becomes aware to FDA consistent with 21 CFR Part 803.\n\nExample 3\n\nA non-traditional device manufacturer worked with a traditional device manufacturer (original equipment manufacturer (OEM)) to produce, as a contract manufacturer, ventilators that were designed by the traditional device manufacturer. Such devices were authorized under the umbrella EUA for ventilators and ventilator accessories87 and distributed by the OEM during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFootnote 87: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/ventilators-and-ventilator-accessories-eus.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. Before August 1, to help FDA plan for transition-related premarket review activities, the OEM submits an \"EUA report\" to the CDRH Document Control Center with \"Attention: Notification of Intent\" on the cover letter of the submission to inform FDA that it intends to pursue marketing authorization. This EUA report includes the information outlined in Section V.A. of this guidance.\n\nOn October 1, the OEM submits a marketing submission to FDA. In its marketing submission, the OEM includes a \"Transition Implementation Plan\" for already distributed ventilators in the case of a positive decision as well as in the case of a negative decision on the marketing submission. On October 10, the marketing submission is determined to be administratively incomplete because it is missing a test report for a biocompatibility endpoint; the marketing submission is not accepted for review (an \"RTA1 decision\"). The OEM resolves the acceptance review deficiency by including the missing test report for the biocompatibility endpoint and resubmits the marketing submission on November 1. On November 8, the marketing submission is accepted for substantive review.\n--------------------\nContext title: Transition Plan for Medical Devices Issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Guidance for Industry, Other Stakeholders, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7449637651443481", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: No. The training of industry and academic personnel to enable them to properly perform their duties is the responsibility of their employers. However, FDA is prepared to participate in any training courses, which may be offered by industry associations or the academic community to the extent that resources will allow.\n4. If the GLPs are Phase I of Bioresearch Monitoring, what other phases are anticipated by FDA?\n\nOther phases include new regulations on obligations of sponsors and monitors of clinical investigations, obligations of clinical investigators, and obligations of institutional review boards. Note that these regulations are directed towards efficacy data and the protection of human subjects whereas the GLPs are directed towards safety data.\n5. Who makes the decision on whether or not a headquarters scientist participates in a GLP inspection? Why can't we have a headquarters scientist on each inspection?\n\nThe scheduling bureau makes the decision. During the past two years, headquarters scientists have participated in about half of all GLP inspections and, with rare exception, the Bureau of Biologics assigns a headquarters scientist to each GLP inspection. Resources do not permit more extensive participation.\n\nHow are laboratories selected for inspection?\n\nLaboratories are selected for inspection by bureaus within FDA. The criteria for selection are actual or potential involvement in studies associated with products regulated by FDA. Inspections will involve a specific study submitted to a bureau or a study selected from the firm's master list which is of interest to FDA.\n\nHow often can a laboratory expect to be inspected?\n\nRoutine surveillance inspections will occur at least once every two years or more frequently depending upon findings of previous inspections. However, more frequent inspections may occur when an audit of a specific study submitted to FDA or EPA in support of a marketing application is required.\n\nEither type of inspection can result in more frequent visits if serious adverse findings are reported. These latter visits are considered compliance or follow-up inspections and are carried out to determine if correction of previous violative conditions have been made.\n8. Will laboratories be notified in advance of an inspection? Because of the comments received during the conferences and the experiences to date with this program, laboratories will generally be notified prior to inspection. However, compliance or special investigation inspections may not follow this procedure.\n9. Can a laboratory postpone an inspection? A facility may at the time of initial FDA contact request a postponement. Such a postponement may occur when personnel responsible for the conduct of the study to be audited will be unavailable at the anticipated inspection date. FDA expects to be reasonable in arranging for an inspection date. Unreasonable delays in scheduling the inspection will however be viewed by FDA as a refusal to permit an inspection.\n10. Can a laboratory request an inspection? How? A facility may request an inspection from either the local FDA district office or from FDA headquarters. However, an inspection will be initiated only with headquarters concurrence. Consideration will be given to the work schedules under which district management is operating.\n11. If a laboratory is not performing a study on an FDA regulated product at the time the investigator arrives, will the inspection still be carried out? Routinely, GLP inspections are not scheduled unless the Agency has received a final report on a regulated product or has received submitted protocols, interim study reports, or knows that a study on a regulated product is underway. In the case of a laboratory that is not currently performing a study on a regulated product the laboratory will be asked to consent to an inspection. The FDA investigator will utilize an ongoing study, even though it is not associated with an FDA regulated product, to document the laboratory's compliance with GLPs. In such cases, the study will not be audited in terms of validating the raw data, and specifics of the study will not be included in the inspection report.\n12. Will inspections cover other areas such as chemistry, physical testing, metallurgy, etc.?To the extent that the protocol of a nonclinical laboratory study requires tests in the field of metallurgy, clinical chemistry, etc., we will examine and evaluate adherence to test specifications or protocol requirements.\n* Are firms notified of specific studies to be audited? Will sufficient time be allowed to seek authorization from the sponsor of the study to disclose the data to the FDA investigator? What happens if the sponsor of the study refuses to authorize the laboratory to disclose the records?\n\nAs stated with respect to prior notification of inspection, where FDA has an interest in auditing a study, ample time generally will be provided for the facility to seek authorization from the sponsor to disclose the data. In some cases, FDA investigators may begin inspecting the physical layout of the facilities while authorization to release the study records is being obtained. If the sponsor refuses to authorize disclosure of the records to the investigator, FDA will pursue the matter directly with the sponsor.\n* Can FDA investigators ask for records to which they are not legally entitled; can they engage in \"fishing expeditions?\"\n\nIt is not FDA policy to request documents during an inspection to which the Agency is not legally entitled. On occasion, the Agency may request such documents when pursuing an audit trail of a possible violation. Under these circumstances, it is the laboratory's prerogative to cooperate or refuse without fear of reprisal. The requests should be specific and pertinent to the inspection. The Agency discourages investigators from making vague requests to see documents with no specific purpose in mind.\n* Should the Form-FD-483, Notice of Observations issued by the FDA investigator reflect current practices only; and should it include practices that were corrected during the course of the inspection?\n\nThe FD-483 can include historical practices, which may have affected the scientific validity of the nonclinical study in question even though subsequent correction may have occurred. Any corrective action taken by the facility will be noted by the investigator in the establishment inspection report.\n* At time of the observation, the management should discuss any differing opinions and attempt to clarify the investigator's perceptions or observations. The management may also, at the conclusion of the inspection, offer to explain what the management considers to be erroneous 483 observations. Should the matter in question remain unresolved, a written objection should be sent to the local FDA district director or a meeting with district personnel should be requested to attempt to resolve the issue.\n* What is the procedure for correcting errors in the FDA investigator's inspection report? Such errors can be damaging to the laboratories since the reports are ultimately available through FOI.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.03822660446167", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:... (e) The refusal to permit access to or copying of any record as required by section... 704(a).... (f) The refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704.\u201d Section 303 (21 U.S.C 333) provides penalties for violations of Section 301.\n\n3 Delay of Inspections\n\nDelays may occur for many reasons, some of which are beyond the control of the facility. However, where an owner, operator, or agent causes the delay of an inspection, this may cause the drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\n4 Delay Scheduling Pre-announced Inspections\n\nThe FD&C Act does not require FDA to pre-announce its inspections. Therefore, FDA usually does not pre-announce for-cause and routine surveillance inspections. It is, however, FDA'sgeneral practice to contact the firm before an investigator arrives at the inspection site for pre-approval and pre-license inspections, and most inspections of foreign facilities of drug products. This pre-announcement, although not required, is intended to facilitate the inspection process and ensure that appropriate records and personnel will be made available.\n\nFDA's efforts to schedule pre-announced inspections include sending correspondence to the facility's point of contact e-mail address, including the facility's U.S. agent if the facility is a foreign facility. FDA will make reasonable accommodations for local conditions, such as weather or security situations, holidays, and other non-work days, and, where appropriate, scheduled manufacturing campaigns. Examples of delay in scheduling a pre-announced inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility will not agree to a proposed inspection start date and does not give a reasonable explanation for its failure to do so.\n\nAfter scheduling an inspection, a facility requests a later start date without giving a reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility fails to respond following FDA's attempt to contact the facility's designated contact(s).\n\nAn example of a potentially reasonable explanation that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act includes, but is not limited to:\n\nManufacturing at the facility is not on-going, for example running only one manufacturing campaign per month and the facility requests a different date than that proposed by or agreed to by FDA so that manufacturing will occur during the FDA inspection of the facility.\n\n2 Delay During an Inspection\n\nAn FDA inspection is intended to enable the Agency to review a facility's compliance with certain laws and regulations. In a drug facility, FDA has broad authority to inspect things that bear on whether the drugs are adulterated, misbranded, or are otherwise in violation of the FD&C Act. Actions by a facility's owner, operator, or agent before or after the beginning of an inspection that impede an FDA investigator at the inspection site from performing the inspection in a reasonable manner may be considered delaying the inspection. FDA is aware that its appearance on-site may initially cause some minor confusion and/or inconveniences to the facility's employees. Minor delays that result from good faith efforts by the facility to comply with FDA requests generally would not be considered unreasonable. Examples of delays during an inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator access to an area of the facility until a specific future date or time even though the area is operational and is an area of the inspection site that FDA has authority to inspect, without giving a reasonable explanation.\n\n2.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA facility leaves the FDA investigator in a conference room without access to necessary documentation or responsible individuals for an unreasonable period of time that interferes with the investigator's ability to complete the inspection.\n\nAn example of a potentially reasonable explanation that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act includes, but is not limited to:\n\nA facility does not provide the FDA investigator access to aseptic processing areas until the investigator accommodates the facility's documented governing procedures.\n\nDelay Producing Records\n\nA critical aspect of FDA's preparation for inspection and inspection of drug facilities is the review and collection of hardcopy and electronic records, files, and papers bearing on whether the drugs are adulterated, misbranded, or are otherwise in violation of the FD&C Act. For example, records may be reviewed to verify compliance, but may also need to be collected to document evidence of deviations, interstate commerce, product labeling and promotion, and to identify the party or parties responsible for a variety of actions. Although FDA recognizes that facilities require a reasonable amount of time to produce records requested, especially if the records are maintained at a different site, a delay in producing records to FDA without reasonable explanation may be considered delaying the inspection. Examples of delays in producing records that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nDuring an inspection, the FDA investigator requests, within a specific, reasonable timeframe, records that FDA has authority to inspect, but the facility fails to produce the requested records within the timeframe requested by FDA, without reasonable explanation.\n\nFDA requests records pursuant to section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, but the facility fails to produce the requested records in a timely manner, without reasonable explanation.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe FDA investigator requests translation of the records into English, and the translation is not readily available.\n\nThe records requested are not available at that time because they are being used for a manufacturing operation that is in progress.\n\nThe volume of the records requested is sufficiently large as to require reasonable time to compile.\n\nIn instances where the facility provides a reasonable explanation for delaying production of records, the facility should also ensure that the resulting delay is of a reasonable duration.\n\nIV Denial of Inspection\n\nFDA interprets the word deny to include active behavior by the owner, operator, or agent of a drug facility to prevent an authorized representative of the FDA from conducting an inspection or to prevent FDA from completing an inspection. This includes statements or physical actions intended to avoid inspection or to mislead, deceive, or impede the investigator. Examples of behavior that may constitute a denial that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility rejects FDA's attempt to schedule a pre-announced inspection.\n\nUpon arrival at the facility, the facility does not allow the FDA investigator to begin the inspection.\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator to inspect the facility because certain staff members are not present, without a reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator to inspect the facility by falsely alleging the facility does not manufacture, process, pack, or hold drugs.\n\nA facility sends staff home for the day and tells the FDA investigator that the facility is not producing any product.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nAt the beginning of an unannounced inspection, appropriate personnel are not immediately available to accurately answer the FDA investigator's questions.\n\nThe FDA investigator arrives for an unannounced inspection, but the facility is closed due to scheduled maintenance.\n\nV Limiting of Inspection\n\nAn owner, operator, or agent of a drug facility who prevents an authorized representative of the FDA from conducting an inspection to the extent allowable under the law may be viewed as limiting inspection under section 501(j). Below are examples of behavior that FDA considers to constitute a limitation that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\nLimiting Access to Facilities and/or Manufacturing Processes\n\nPreventing an authorized representative of the FDA reasonable access to an area of the site that FDA is entitled to inspect may be considered limiting the inspection. This includes the refusal to disclose or permit observation of the manufacturing processes.

Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9729984402656555", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: If the product that is the subject of a PBRER is also approved or under development as a component of a fixed combination product or a multi-drug regimen, this section should summarise important safety findings from use of the combination therapy.\n\nIf this PBRER is for a fixed combination product, this section should summarise important safety information arising from the individual components.\n\nThe information specific to the combination can be incorporated into a separate section(s) of the PBRER for one or all of the individual components of the combination.\n\nFindings from Non-Interventional Studies\n\nThis section should summarise relevant safety information or information with potential impact on the benefit or risk evaluations, from MAH-sponsored non-interventional studies that became available during the reporting interval (e.g., observational studies, epidemiological studies, registries, and active surveillance programmes). This should include relevant information from drug utilisation studies when applicable to multiple regions.\n\nA listing of any MAH-sponsored post-marketing non-interventional study(ies) with the primary aim of identifying, characterising, or quantifying a safety hazard, confirming the safety profile of the medicinal product, or measuring the effectiveness of risk management measures that were completedor ongoing during the reporting interval should be included in an appendix (see Section 3.7 of this Guideline for the information that should be included in the listing).\n\nFinal study reports completed during the reporting interval for the studies mentioned in the paragraph above should also be included in the regional appendix of the report where stipulated by regional requirements.\n\nInformation from Other Clinical Trials and Sources\n\n3.9.1 Other Clinical Trials\n\nThis subsection should summarise information accessible to the MAH with reasonable and appropriate effort from any other clinical trial/study sources, including results from pooled analyses or meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials, and safety information provided by co-development partners or from investigator-initiated trials.\n\n3.9.2 Medication Errors\n\nThis subsection should summarise relevant information on patterns of medication errors and potential medication errors, even when not associated with adverse outcomes. A potential medication error is the recognition of circumstances that could lead to a medication error, and may or may not involve a patient. Such information may be relevant to the interpretation of safety data or the overall benefit-risk evaluation of the medicinal product. A medication error may arise at any stage in the medication use process, and may involve patients, consumers, or healthcare professionals.\n\nThis information may be received by the MAH via spontaneous reporting systems, medical information queries, customer complaints, screening of digital media, patient support programmes, or other available information sources.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.073823928833008", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: Study ID (e.g., protocol number or other identifier);\n\nStudy title (abbreviated study title, if applicable);\n\nStudy type (e.g., randomized clinical trial, cohort study, case-control study);\n\nPopulation studied (including country and other relevant population descriptors, e.g., paediatric population or trial subjects with impaired renal function);* Study start (as defined by the MAH) and projected completion dates;\n\nOngoing (clinical trial has begun);\n\nCompleted (clinical study report is finalised).\n\n3.7.1 Completed Clinical Trials\n\nSection 7.1 of the PBRER should provide a brief summary of clinically important emerging efficacy and safety findings obtained from clinical trials completed during the reporting interval. This information can be presented in narrative format or as a synopsis.5 It could include information that supports or refutes previously identified safety concerns, as well as evidence of new safety signals.\n\nFootnote 5: Examples of synopses are provided in ICH E3 and CIOMS VII.\n\n3.7.2 Ongoing Clinical Trials\n\nIf the MAH is aware of clinically important information that has arisen from ongoing clinical trials (e.g., learned through interim safety analyses or as a result of unblinding of subjects with adverse events), this section should briefly summarise the concern(s). It could include information that supports or refutes previously identified safety concerns, as well as evidence of new safety signals.\n\n3.7.3 Long-Term Follow-up\n\nWhere applicable, this section should provide information from long-term follow-up of subjects from clinical trials of investigational drugs, particularly advanced therapy products.\n\n3.7.4 Other Therapeutic Use of Medicinal Product\n\nThis section of the PBRER should include clinically important safety information from other programmes conducted by the MAH that follow a specific protocol, with solicited reporting as per ICH Guideline E2D (e.g., expanded access programmes, compassionate use programmes, particular patient use, single-patient Investigational New Drug applications [INDs], treatment INDs, and other organised data collection).\n\n3.7.5 New Safety Data Related to Fixed Combination Therapies\n\nUnless otherwise specified by national or regional regulatory requirements, the following options can be used to present data from combination therapies:\n\nIf the product that is the subject of a PBRER is also approved or under development as a component of a fixed combination product or a multi-drug regimen, this section should summarise important safety findings from use of the combination therapy.\n\nIf this PBRER is for a fixed combination product, this section should summarise important safety information arising from the individual components.\n\nThe information specific to the combination can be incorporated into a separate section(s) of the PBRER for one or all of the individual components of the combination.\n\nFindings from Non-Interventional Studies\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.9637961387634277", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain adverse events in clinical trials can be excluded from the clinical trials summary tabulations, but such exclusions should be explained in the report. For example, adverse events that have been defined in the protocol as \"exempt\" from special collection and entry into the safety database because they are anticipated in the patient population, and those that represent study endpoints, can be excluded (e.g., deaths reported in a trial of a drug for congestive heart failure where all-cause mortality is the primary efficacy endpoint, disease progression in cancer trials).\n\nCausality assessment is generally useful for the evaluation of individual rare ADRs. Individual case causality assessment has less value in the analysis of aggregate data, where group comparisons of rates are possible. Therefore, the summary tabulations should include all SAEs for the investigational drug, active controls, and placebo. It may be useful to give rates by dose.\n\n3.6.3 Cumulative and Interval Summary Tabulations from Post-Marketing Data Sources\n\nSection 6.3 of the PBRER should provide background for the appendix that provides cumulative and interval summary tabulations of adverse reactions, from the IBD to the DLP of the current PBRER. As described in ICH Guideline E2D, for marketed medicinal products, spontaneously reported* adverse events usually imply at least a suspicion of causality by the reporter, and should be considered to be adverse reactions for regulatory reporting purposes. The tabulation should include:\n\nSerious and non-serious adverse drug reactions from spontaneous ICSRs, including reports from healthcare professionals, consumers, scientific literature, and regulatory authorities;\n\nSerious adverse reactions from non-interventional studies; and\n\nSolicited reports* of serious adverse reactions.\n\nThe tabulation should include interval and cumulative data presented side-by-side (see Appendix B, Table 7), and should be organised by SOC.\n\nFor special issues or concerns, additional tabulations of adverse reactions can be presented by indication, route of administration, or other variables.

The overall control strategy was developed in accordance with the main guideline and ICH Q7-Q11.\n\nEquipment Design and Integration\n\nWithin the continuous process segment in Figure 1, the following processes occur:\n\nReaction 1: Starting materials 1 and 2 are coupled in a PFR to produce Intermediate 1. Diversion Point D1 is located after the PFR to permit material diversion when PFR conditions are outside predefined acceptance criteria. The reaction is quenched as an integrated operation after the PFR, and unwanted by-products are removed by liquid-liquid extraction. The resultant solution (Intermediate 1) is used as an input for the second reaction without isolation.\n\nReaction 2: Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 (prepared upstream through separate batch unit operations) are coupled in a second PFR to form the crude drug substance. The online PAT near the reactor exit (T1) monitors conversion of Intermediate 1 to the crude drug substance. Diversion Point D2 located after PAT is used to divert non-conforming material.\n\nDrug Substance Isolation: The crude drug substance is purified by liquid-liquid extraction and continuous two-stage crystallisation. Distillation prior to crystallisation provides desired concentration of the crude drug substance solution. Diversion Point D3 allows for material diversion at the crystalliser. The crystal slurry is filtered using two agitated filter dryers operating in an alternating fashion to enable continuous operation. The isolated drug substance is then milled using batch operations to achieve the desired particle size distribution prior to packaging.\n\nTwo surge points (each containing multiple surge tanks) are used: one before Reaction 2 and another before continuous crystallisation. These are important components of the system design and control strategy, as they improve process robustness and mitigate temporary differences in mass flow rates by decoupling upstream and downstream operations.\n\nThe design of the overall system and each unit operation, along with the control strategy, optimise material quality. For example, PFR design elements (i.e., dimension and configuration) allow control of temperature, heat and mass transfer rates, and reaction time. These parameters were shown during development to be important to the drug substance impurity profile.\n\nProcess Control and Monitoring\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8930587768554688", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: The design of the overall system and each unit operation, along with the control strategy, optimise material quality. For example, PFR design elements (i.e., dimension and configuration) allow control of temperature, heat and mass transfer rates, and reaction time. These parameters were shown during development to be important to the drug substance impurity profile.\n\nProcess Control and Monitoring\n\nHolistic controls used across Reactions 1 and 2 ensure consistent operations and quality of the resulting crude drug substance. The stoichiometry of Reaction 1 is controlled via control of concentrations and flow rates of the feeds. Conversion of starting materials to Intermediate 1 with minimal impurity formation is ensured through control of the reaction temperature and flowrate (i.e., reaction time). Reaction 2 is controlled through feedback control of the addition rate of Intermediate 2 based on the PAT measurement of residual Intermediate 1 levels. This ensurescorrect stoichiometry for that reaction and minimises the impact of variability of the Intermediate 1 feed solution on drug substance purity. The PAT also measures levels of crude drug substance and impurities, which confirm successful operation of all preceding steps and consistent product quality. Liquid/Liquid extraction ensures appropriate purity control after Reaction 2.\n\nRTD was used to develop a suitable strategy for disturbance detection, corrective actions, and material diversion. RTD characterisation was based on mathematical modeling of all unit operations and surge points across the entire CM process over planned mass flow rates. The RTD was then confirmed through experimental tracer studies for appropriate segments of the commercial equipment. Decisions for triggering material diversion are based on comparing process parameters and PAT measurements to predefined acceptance criteria with timing and duration of diversion informed by the RTD. Importantly, the RTD is also used for material traceability purposes.\n\nUnderstanding of process dynamics and its impact on quality attributes of material produced throughout the entire process was also used to guide start-up and shutdown strategies. For example, during start-up of Reactions 1 and 2, a small amount of Intermediate 1 or crude drug substance is diverted at Diversion Points 1 or 2, respectively, to allow those materials to reach the target concentrations before processing into subsequent operations. The criteria for diversion were established based on time considering the RTD. This approach was supported by development studies and appropriately confirmed in commercial process equipment. PAT monitoring after Reaction 2 provides additional verification that appropriate criteria have been met during start-up. Collection of material proceeds to the end of the process as subsequently described.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.675528526306152", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: 8.45 Where physical attributes of the API are critical (e.g., APIs intended for use in solid oral dosage forms or suspensions), blending operations should be validated to show homogeneity of the combined batch. Validation should include testing of critical attributes (e.g., particle size distribution, bulk density, and tap density) that may be affected by the blending process.\n\n8.46 If the blending could adversely affect stability, stability testing of the final blended batches should be performed.\n\n8.47 The expiry or retest date of the blended batch should be based on the manufacturing date of the oldest tailings or batch in the blend.\n\n8.5 Contamination Control\n\n8.50 Residual materials can be carried over into successive batches of the same intermediate or API if there is adequate control. Examples include residue adhering to the wall of a micronizer, residual layer of damp crystals remaining in a centrifuge bowl after discharge, and incomplete discharge of fluids or crystals from a processing vessel upon transfer of the material to the next step in the process. Such carryover should not result in the carryover of degradants or microbial contamination that may adversely alter the established API impurity profile.\n\n8.51 Production operations should be conducted in a manner that will prevent contamination of intermediates or APIs by other materials.\n\n8.52 Precautions to avoid contamination should be taken when APIs are handled after purification.\n\nPACKaging and IDentification labelling of APIs and INTERMEDIATES\n\n9.1 General\n\n9.10 There should be written procedures describing the receipt, identification, quarantine, sampling, examination and/or testing and release, and handling of packaging and labelling materials.\n\n9.11 Packaging and labelling materials should conform to established specifications.

These containers should not be reactive, additive, or absorptive so as to alter the quality of the intermediate or API beyond the specified limits.\n\n9.22 If containers are re-used, they should be cleaned in accordance with documented procedures and all previous labels should be removed or defaced.\n\n9.3 Label Issuance and Control\n\n9.30 Access to the label storage areas should be limited to authorised personnel.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.358962059020996", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Design and configuration of equipment (e.g., compatibility and integrity of equipment components for the maximum run time or cycles; geometry of constituent parts to promote the desired transformation; spatial arrangement of equipment to facilitate material flow, maintenance, and avoid build-up or fouling)\n\nPhysical connections and digital control interfaces between equipment (e.g., use of a surge tank between two unit operations to mitigate temporary differences in mass flow rates)\n\nLocations of material diversion and sampling points (e.g., selection of locations for a diverter valve and sampling probe without disturbing material flow and transformation)\n\nFurthermore, appropriate design or selection of equipment for a CM process may enable process simplification (e.g., through a reduction in the number of unit operations), facilitate process monitoring and material diversion, and improve process capability and performance. For example, in a drug substance process, reactor design can effectively reduce formation and build-up of impurities, resulting in fewer purification steps. Similarly, for therapeutic protein drug substance manufacturing, system design can enable process intensification and reduce cycle times.\n\n3.1.5 Process Monitoring and Control\n\nProcess monitoring and control support the maintenance of a state of control during production and allow real-time evaluation of system performance. Common approaches to process monitoring and control--including establishment of target setpoints and control limits, design space, and specifications for attributes being measured--are applicable to CM.\n\nProcess analytical technology (PAT) (ICH Q8) is well-suited for CM. Example applications include in-line UV flow cells to monitor therapeutic protein concentration, in-line near-infrared spectroscopy to assess blend uniformity or water content, and on-line HPLC to monitor conversion of a chemical reaction. The use of PAT enables disturbances to be detected in real time. Therefore, CM is readily amenable to automated process control strategies based on, for example, active process control such as feedforward or feedback process control. Principles of control strategy as described in ICH Q8 and ICH Q11 are applicable to CM processes.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.046853542327881", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Appropriate controls and monitoring requirements for the continuous crystallization were extensively investigated during development in similar, but smaller scale equipment andappropriately verified using commercial equipment. Process development included spiking studies using impurity-enriched feed solutions and intentional perturbations in process parameters (i.e., feed flow rates, their ratios, and temperatures). An evaluation of the encrusted solids in the crystallizer over extended run times demonstrated the solids were the same form and purity as the free-flowing drug substance slurry. The set of process parameters and ranges identified by these studies were appropriately scaled up. Implementation of these controls along with post-crystallization material tests (e.g., crystal form, purity) ensure consistent quality of the resulting drug substance throughout continuous crystallization and subsequent filtration.\n\nThe resulting material is milled using a batch operation to provide a drug substance of the appropriate particle size for use in drug product manufacturing. Procedures were developed to allow diversion of material at Diversion Point D3 in the event desired process conditions or material attributes are not met. Diversion of the drug substance from the crystallizer was found to be unnecessary either during start-up or shutdown.\n\nConsideration of Other Controls (2.3)\n\nProcess robustness and performance over time are important considerations. A risk assessment was performed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to support the proposed run time (which can be up to several months). It identified a number of considerations and corresponding controls/measures. Examples are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c c} \\hline \\hline\nConsideration & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Controls/Measures} \\ \\hline Cleaning and & (\\bullet) & Establishment of a risk-based cleaning strategy, including \\ fouling potential & & understanding of the impact of build-up on drug substance quality \\  & (\\bullet) & Additional monitoring to assess fouling and cleanliness (e.g., pressure \\  & & sensors at the discharge of feed pumps, periodic visual checks for the \\  & (\\bullet) & Reduction of other risk factors (e.g., filtering feed streams to further \\  & & reduce fouling risk) \\ \\hline Stability of in-process materials & (\\bullet) & Hold times at key points in the process (e.g., feed streams; \\  & & accumulated material at the surge points, reactors, and crystallizer) \\  & (\\bullet) & Risk assessment of microbiological growth (i.e., negligible risk based \\  & & on the nature of the process materials and conditions) \\ \\hline Calibration and & (\\bullet) & Periodic checks at selected points (e.g., process parameter \\ potential for & & measurements for the PFR, system suitability for the PAT analyzer) \\ changes/drift in & (\\bullet) & Dual sensors at selected locations (e.g., temperature probes for the \\ instrumentation & & PFR) so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken \\ \\hline Equipment & (\\bullet) & Maintenance requirements for target run time \\ maintenance & (\\bullet) & Use of redundant equipment (e.g., backup pumps) at key locations \\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Examples of Other Controls for Consideration\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdditionally, specifications for input materials were evaluated during process development. There were no differences between batch and continuous processing for this example.\n\nCollectively, the process understanding developed along with implementation of the various controls described provide a robust and reliable control strategy. This ensures consistent quality of the resulting drug substance including the impurity profile, physicochemical properties, and ability of the system to identify and appropriately react to unexpected events.\n\nProcess Validation (2.4)\n\nThe combination of process controls, online PAT measurements, comprehensive monitoring of process parameters and material attributes, and end-product testing results in a data-rich environment for this process. Together with system understanding generated during development, this combination of control strategy elements enabled the use of a traditional process validation for commercial product launch and continuous process verification to validate process changes over the product lifecycle.\n\nA range of batch sizes was initially established based on material demands and the quantities of material necessary to match input needs of the final batch unit operations. The process was validated using a fixed number of batches. A single planned start-up and shutdown of the commercial CM system was used to manufacture the process validation batches. This approach was supported by the totality of evidence demonstrating the start-up and shutdown capabilities of the system. This evidence included development work on smaller equipment (with appropriate technical justification for being representative), commercial equipment and system qualification data, results of a pre-validation demonstration run, and extensive process monitoring of the CM system that can verify success of each start-up and shutdown in real time.\n\nSubsequently, a continuous process verification approach was adopted after product approval to validate increases in batch size with extension of run time. The batch size increase was possible without impact to the equipment scale for downstream batch operations. This approach used a risk assessment for the longer run time, which concluded that process performance and material quality would not be impacted. Under the continuous process verification approach, data generated during the manufacture of each batch was used to support successful validation of that batch with the extended run time. This included information such as system performance monitoring and data logs, along with other controls that ensure material quality with appropriate detection and corrective action. Additionally, appropriate regulatory actions were taken to communicate this batch size increase with run time change and use of the continuous process verification approach.\n\n3 Regulatory Considerations (3)\n\nRefer to section IV (4). In consideration of the specific CM process design, additional elements may need to be included in a dossier. For instance, in this example, the influence of surge points on the material diversion and collection strategy, including the fate of materials, was described.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nI Introduction and Example System Overview (1)\n\nThis annex exemplifies one approach to implementing CM for a tablet drug product based on the scientific principles described in the main body of this guidance. The examples and approaches in this annex are illustrative, and alternative approaches can be used. Specific considerations relating to the implementation of a continuous direct compression process for a chemical entity are presented.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates a continuous direct compression process that consists of continuous feeding, blending, and tablet compression unit operations, with batch mode film coating. It is not intended to represent a regulatory flow diagram.\n\nA PAT tool using an NIR method monitors blend uniformity and triggers tablet diversion. Run time at a predefined mass flow rate is used to define the batch size range; in this case, the overall marketing demand requires batch sizes between 360 and 1080 kilograms of the drug product.\n\nII Control Strategy and Other Technical Considerations (2)\n\nThe CM system and its control strategy were designed to mitigate the impact of disturbances to ensure output material quality. The overall control strategy was developed in accordance with the main body of this guidance and the ICH guidances for industry Q8(R2), Q9, and Q10.\n\nFigure 2: Example of a Tablet Drug Product CM System\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n1.1.1 Material Characterization and Control (2.1)\n\nDuring process design and development, a quality-by-design approach was adopted that identified equipment and process parameters critical to control of the process. Furthermore, the relationships between material quality attributes and their impact on unit operations (particularly the loss-in-weight feeders (LIWFs) and blender) and product critical quality attributes (CQAs) were evaluated. Bulk density of the primary excipient and particle size distribution (PSD) of the drug substance were identified as critical to blend and content uniformity. A defined bulk density range and three-tier (d10, d50, d90) PSD specification were implemented for the excipient and drug substance, respectively.\n\n1.1.2 Equipment Design and Integration (2.2)\n\nUnit operations and system components (e.g., NIR probe) were designed or selected to mitigate the impact of disturbances on final product quality. The overall design principle is, where possible, to use gravity to move material. During system integration, the material flow was coordinated across all unit operations to avoid material accumulation or emptying. System mass balance was obtained through understanding of material flow (i.e., RTD) at the intended operating conditions of each unit operation. The impact of equipment design and operation on process dynamics was characterized by the RTD of individual unit operations, as well as the RTD of process segments between individual unit operations and the diversion point. The RTDs were determined by replacing the drug substance in the formulation with a tracer that has highly similar flow properties to those of the drug substance.\n\nThe following aspects of equipment design and integration were emphasized:\n--------------------\nContext title: Q13 Continuous Manufacturing of Drug Substances and Drug Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.3411760330200195", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Models used only for process development in 3.2.S.2.6 and 3.2.P.2.3.\n\n5 Glossary\n\nActive Process Controls:\n\nA system consisting of hardware and software architecture, mechanisms, and algorithms that automatically adjust a process to maintain the process output within a desired range.

Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, \"General Requirements for Informed Consent\" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD. Improving comprehension for cancer patients with low literacy skills: strategies for clinicians. CA Cancer J Clin. 1998 May-Jun;48(3):151-62. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.48.3.151. PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n\nThe investigator should notify the IRB of the consent process to be used. The process may be described in the protocol, or the investigator may provide a brief document describing the process to be used. The materials and procedures used for subject recruitment, which typically include advertisements, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB to ensure that these materials are appropriate, as described in section4.1, \"Review of All Informed Consent Materials\" (see 21 CFR 56.109(b) and 56.111(a)(4)).60 The IRB must determine that investigators will seek consent from prospective subjects under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). FDA considers this to include ensuring that the consent process described by the investigator allows sufficient time for prospective subjects to consider the information, provides time and opportunity for the subjects to ask questions and have those questions answered, and allows time and opportunity for the subjects to consider fully whether to participate.\n\nFootnote 60: For further information, see the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects.\n\nTo approve a clinical investigation, the IRB must find that informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's LAR and that informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4) and (5)). FDA recommends that the IRB inquire as to who will conduct the consent discussion and what procedures will be followed. If procedures other than a face-to-face consent discussion are proposed, such as by telephone, the IRB should consider whether the procedures will provide effective communication and accomplish the goals of the informed consent process. Alternative procedures may be of special concern when the clinical investigation involves complex procedures or when risks may be difficult to comprehend.\n\nFDA regulations authorize the IRB to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as well as the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should consider using this authority when it may be appropriate61 or enhance the protection provided to subjects (for example, when the investigator is alsothe treating physician for a prospective subject, when the person conducting the consent interview is relatively inexperienced, or when the clinical investigation involves vulnerable subjects). In addition to observing a sample of consent discussions, the IRB could interview subjects to assess the consent process and evaluate the subjects' understanding of the clinical investigation.\n\n3.3.3 IRB Review of Updated Informed Consent Documents\n\nAll information given to subjects as part of the consent process is to be reviewed and approved by the IRB (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).62 During the clinical investigation, new information about the research or changes to the clinical investigation may arise that affect the rights or welfare of subjects. FDA recommends that IRBs have procedures in place for the timely, efficient, and effective review of such new information or changes. This would include procedures for the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to notify the IRB of any significant new findings that arise during the clinical investigation relevant to a subject's decision to continue participation (see section3.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects\", and (\\mathtt{Frequently\\ Asked\\ Question}#16)). When new information or changes in the clinical investigation warrant revisions of the consent form (and any accompanying changes to the protocol), such revisions must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before the revisions are initiated, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)-(4)).\n\nFootnote 62: This would include all addenda to the consent form and other materials used in the consent process.\n\nSome changes may be reviewed and approved by expedited means, as provided for by 21 CFR 56.110. For example, an IRB may decide expedited review is appropriate for changes to the consent form that reflect minor changes in the protocol or recruitment plan (e.g., new advertising for subjects following initiation of the clinical investigation when the advertisement incorporates wording from the approved consent form). When expedited review is used, if the IRB reviewer is unsure whether the change qualifies for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110(b), FDA recommends that the reviewer (if other than the IRB chair) consult with the IRB chair. If doubts persist as to whether the change qualifies for expedited review, then the change should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB.63\n\nFootnote 63: As indicated at section4.2, when new information is added to the consent form that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research.\n\nAdministrative changes, such as the correction of typographical and spelling errors, and changes in telephone numbers, may be submitted to the IRB at any time, including during continuing review, and do not require formal review and approval. Although such changes do not need IRB review, updatedversions of the consent form should be sent to the IRB so that they have current copies of the informed consent form on file.64\n\nFootnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.757126808166504", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.608599662780762", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.8544676303863525", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to stakeholder inquiries, we are clarifying that the provisions of the 2018 Requirements related to the content, organization, and presentation of information included in the consent form and process as well as the basic and additional elements of informed consent are not inconsistent with FDA's current policies and guidances. This may avoid the need for sponsors or investigators to develop, and IRBs to review, two separate informed consent forms. See Appendix for a subset of the new informed consent provisions from the 2018 Requirements.\n\n4 Expedited Review Procedures and List\n\nFDA's regulation at 21 CFR 56.110 sets forth expedited IRB review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk. Section 56.110(a) describes a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by an IRB through an expedited review procedure that may be established through a Federal Register Notice. FDA established and published this list in the Federal Register on November 9, 1998 (the 1998 list).8 Section 56.110(b) makes clear that, as appropriate, IRB \"reviewer(s)\" must find that the research on the list involves no more than minimal risk in order for the IRB to use the expedited review procedure.\n\nFootnote 8: 63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998; https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-11-09/pdf/98-29748.pdf.\n\nFDA recognizes that under the 2018 Requirements at 45 CFR 46.110(b), an IRB may use the expedited procedures for research appearing on the expedited review list, unless the IRB reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk. Because FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with FDA's regulation at 21 CFR 56.110(b) and use the 1998 list for FDA-regulated clinical investigations, including those that are subject to both HHS and FDA regulations.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV IRB Continuing Review\n\nThe 2018 Requirements eliminated the requirement to conduct continuing review in certain circumstances (see 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)). Under 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)(i) and (iii), continuing review will not be required for research that is either eligible for expedited review in accordance with 45 CFR 46.110, or for research that has progressed to the point that the only remaining activities are data analysis, and/or accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care, unless the IRB determines otherwise.\n\nBecause FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with our current requirements for IRB continuing review at 21 CFR 56.109(f), including for clinical investigations that are subject to both HHS and FDA jurisdiction. IRBs are required to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)).9\n\nFootnote 9: For further information, see FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; IRB Continuing Review after Clinical Investigation Approval,\u201d (February 2012),\n\n(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm294558.pdf).\n\nVI Further Clarification\n\nFDA is actively working to harmonize its human subject protection regulations consistent with the Cures Act. We recognize there may be questions regarding the application of other provisions of the 2018 Requirements to FDA-regulated clinical investigations during this interim period. Questions and/or comments requesting further clarification may be submitted at any time to the public docket for this guidance, and FDA will consider issuing additional guidance, if necessary, to address other provisions.\n\nAppendix: Selected Informed Consent provisions from the 2018 requirements\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain new general requirements for informed consent related to the content, organization, and presentation of information in the consent form and process to facilitate a prospective subject's decision about whether to participate in the research.\n\nThe provisions which are new or include new information are as follows:\n\n46.116(a)(4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.\n\n46.117(b)(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the required elements of informed consent required by 45 CFR 46.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative and that the key information required by 45 CFR 46.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided.\n\nBasic and Additional Elements of Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain a new basic element and three additional elements of informed consent, as follows:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNew Basic Element at 45 CFR 46.116(b)(9)\n\nOne of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens:10\n\nFootnote 10: Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record). (45 CFR 46.102(e)(4)).\n\n(i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecicmens could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this might be a possibility; or (ii) A statement that the subject's information or biospecicmens collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies.\n\nNew Additional Elements at 45 CFR 46.116(c)(7) - (9)\n\n46.116(c)(7) A statement that the subject's biospecicmens (even if identifiers are removed) may be used for commercial profit and whether the subject will or will not share in this commercial profit; 46.116(c)(8) A statement regarding whether clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions; and 46.116(c)(9) For research involving biospecicmens, whether the research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing (i.e., sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or exome sequence of that specimen).\n--------------------\nContext title: Impact of Certain Provisions of the Revised Common Rule on FDA-Regulated Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.471161127090454", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: In the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject's LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, \"Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA\u2019s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n\nTraditionally, informed consent has been obtained and documented in a face-to-face interview using paper consent forms. Technologies are available that may serve as an alternative to the paper consent form in the informed consent process.47 Parties interested in pursuing alternative methods of obtaining informed consent should discuss their plan with their IRB and are welcome to contact FDA as needed for advice.48\n\nFootnote 48: Questions related to alternative methods of obtaining informed consent can be directed to the Office of Clinical Policy at gcpaquestions@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nEven in the context of paper consent forms, there may be certain circumstances when an alternative to a face-to-face consent discussion may be appropriate. For example, such an alternative may be appropriate\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]\n\nbe described and noted in subject case histories required to maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).\n\niv.1.3 Requirement for Dating Consent Form\n\nIn addition to signing the consent form, the subject or the subject's LAR must enter the date of signature on the form (21 CFR 50.27(a)) to allow confirmation that the subject or the subject's LAR provided consent prior to participation in the clinical investigation, as required by 21 CFR 50.20. In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject's case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject's case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject's copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, \u201cCoercion and Undue Influence\u201d.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject's LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject's LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\u201d and Frequently Asked Question #7, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\u201d In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?\u201d, Frequently Asked Question #4, \u201cWhat process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?\u201d, and Frequently Asked Question #5, \u201cWhat process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?\u201d\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject's LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: \u201cThe fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the \u2018form\u2019 provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.\u201d\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject's consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject's questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject's LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.38204288482666", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator's responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution's IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution's IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be \"men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.\"1 In addition, IRB members must \"be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice\" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution's own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution's own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution's IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution's IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution's IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution's IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution's IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution's IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.2781530618667603"], "This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Generally, exposure data from nonclinical studies and single-dose clinical studies can be compared to determine whether further metabolite toxicity characterization is warranted. For those metabolites that have been determined to exceed 10 percent of drug-related material in humans only after repeated dosing, steady state levels (clinical and nonclinical) should be used to assess the adequacy of the exposure margins.\n\nQ6:: The M3(R2) guidance says: \"Nonclinical characterization of a human metabolite(s) is only warranted when that metabolite(s) is observed at exposures greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater levels in humans than the maximum exposure seen in the toxicity studies.\"\n\nWhen a human metabolite exposure is compared to the maximum exposure of that metabolite in toxicity studies, should it always be to the highest exposure achieved in the animal studies or is it more appropriate in some cases to use the exposure at the NOAEL, NOEL (no observed effect level), or MTD?\n\nA6: Because the parent drug and metabolites contribute to the target organ toxicity profile observed in animals at the MTD, the exposure comparisons across species should be conducted at the MTD in the animal compared to the maximum exposure in humans at the therapeutic dose, assuming the toxicity of concern can be adequately monitored in humans and does not pose an unacceptable risk. If the toxicity at the MTD is not monitorable in humans or poses an unacceptable risk, then the exposure comparison should be conducted at the NOAEL for the toxicity of concern.\n\nQ7:: When in development, should data on nonclinical metabolites be available?\n\nA7: As described in ICH M3(R2), section III Toxicokinetic and Pharmacokine Studies (3), paragraph 1, in vitro metabolism data for animals and humans should be evaluated before initiating human clinical trials. Data on in vivo metabolism in test species and humans should be available before exposing large numbers of human subjects or treating for long duration (generally before phase 3).\n\nQ8:: Clarification is sought on metabolites that may not be of toxicological concern. In ICH M3(R2), what is meant by \"most\" in the phrase \"most glutathione conjugates\"? Would acyl glucuronides that can undergo chemical rearrangement be an example of a concern? What should we do about chemically reactive metabolites?\n\nA8: Although there are relatively rare exceptions, most glutathione conjugates are formed by conjugation with reactive metabolites to form excretory metabolites that are not of toxicological concern. Most glucuronides are not of concern, except those that undergo chemical rearrangement (e.g., reactive acyl glucuronides). Highly chemically reactive metabolites, although of toxicological concern, do not generally accumulate in plasma due to their short half-life. Generally, it is not feasible to test highly reactive metabolites independently because of their instability, but they are assumed to contribute to the overall nonclinical toxicity of the drug.\n\nQ9: Should safety pharmacology studies be conducted for metabolites that warrant nonclinical characterization?\n\nA9: Clinical studies assessing safety pharmacology endpoints are generally conducted during phase 1. These endpoints will have already been assessed in humans before a full characterization of the metabolites is conducted. Therefore, nonclinical safety pharmacology studies are generally not warranted for the characterization of metabolites. However, if a safety pharmacology signal is seen in humans that was not predicted by nonclinical studies with the parent, then additional safety pharmacology studies of these human metabolites can be considered to better understand the mechanism (see ICH S7A and ICH S7B).\n\nQ10: What does \"in vitro biochemical information\" mean in section III (3), paragraph 1, of ICH M3(R2)?\n\nA10: In vitro biochemical information includes standard in vitro metabolic evaluation (e.g., cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition, pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation assays). It can include studies with hepatic microsomes/hepatocytes or studies on potential interactions via drug transporters.\n\nQ11: What should be the design of nonclinical studies for metabolites (e.g., species, duration, study type)?\n\nA11: This level of detail is generally out of scope for ICH M3(R2); study design should be considered on a case-by-case basis using scientific judgment in consultation with regulatory agencies. Also see answers to other questions in this section (e.g., Q3 and Q9).\n\nQ12: Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n\nA12: The guidance does not specifically address prodrugs. If the animal species converts the prodrug to the active metabolite similarly to humans, then a standard testing approach as recommended in ICH M3(R2) can be used. If the active metabolite is not adequately produced in the animal species, then the target molecule for toxicological evaluation is the active metabolite and therefore additional testing beyond that recommended for metabolites can be appropriate. Timing of the nonclinical testing of the active metabolite in this case should follow the general timelines as outlined in ICH M3(R2) rather than the timing indicated for metabolite testing in section III (3) of M3(R2).\nQ1:: When is assessment of reversibility considered to be appropriate and is it important to demonstrate full reversibility or is it sufficient to demonstrate the potential for full reversibility?\n\nICH M3(R2) states the following in section I.D General Principles (1.4): \"The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterization of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exposure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility.\" Evaluation of the potential for reversibility of toxicity (i.e., return to the original or normal condition) should be provided when there is severe toxicity in a nonclinical study with potential adverse clinical impact. The evaluation can be based on a study of reversibility or on a scientific assessment. The scientific assessment of reversibility can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion, the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect and knowledge of other drugs causing the effect. Thus, recovery arms or studies are not always critical to conclude whether an adverse effect is reversible. The demonstration of full reversibility is not considered essential. A trend towards reversibility (decrease in incidence or severity), and scientific assessment that this trend would eventually progress to full reversibility, are generally sufficient. If full reversibility is not anticipated, this should be considered in the clinical risk assessment. A toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is generally warranted if a scientific assessment cannot predict whether the toxicity will be reversible and if:\n\nthere is severe toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (e.g., (\\leq 10)-fold the clinical exposure); or\n\nthe toxicity is only detectable at an advanced stage of the pathophysiology in humans and where significant reduction in organ function is expected. (The assessment of reversibility in this case should be considered even at (>10)-fold exposure multiples.) A toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is generally not warranted when the toxicity:\n\ncan be readily monitored in humans at an early stage before the toxicity becomes severe; or\n\nis known to be irrelevant to humans (e.g., rodent Harderian gland toxicity); or\n\nis only observed at high exposures not considered clinically relevant (see 2 above for exception); or\n\nis similar to that induced by related agents, and the toxicity based on prior clinical experience with these related agents is considered a manageable risk.\nIf a study of reversibility is called for, it should be available to support clinical studies of a duration similar to those at which the adverse effects were seen nonclinically. However, a reversibility study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials of a duration equivalent to that at which the adverse effect was not observed nonclinically. If a particular lesion is demonstrated to be reversible in a short duration (e.g., 2-week or 1-month) study, and does not progress in severity in longer term studies, repeating the reversibility assessment in longer term toxicity studies is generally not warranted. If a reversibility study is warranted, it is efficient to conduct it as part of a chronic study so that all toxicities of concern can be assessed in a single study, provided that it is not critical to conduct it earlier to support a specific clinical trial.\n\nCombination Drug Toxicity Testing (4)\n\nIf two (or more) late stage entities are combined but for one of them the human dosage/exposure will be higher than that already approved, is it important to conduct a combination toxicity study or are the existing nonclinical data and clinical experience with the lower dose considered adequate to address the nonclinical assessment?\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2)Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.206863880157471", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: M3(R2) Implementation Working Group\n\nM3(R2) Guideline: Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the\n\nConduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization\n\nfor Pharmaceuticals\n\nQuestions & Answers (R2)\n\nCurrent version\n\ndated 5 March 2012\n\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use\n\nICH Secretarist, Chemin Louis-Dunst 15, P.O.

Sponsors should contact the appropriate review division to discuss such situations.\n\nGlossary\n\nDisproportionate drug metabolite -- A metabolite present only in humans or present at higher plasma concentrations in humans than in the animals used in nonclinical studies. In general, these metabolites are of interest if they account for plasma levels greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure, measured as area under the curve at steady state.\n\nMetabolite -- A compound derived from the parent drug through phase 1 and/or phase 2 metabolic pathways.\n\nPharmacologically active metabolite -- A metabolite that has pharmacological activity at the target receptor. The activity may be greater than, equal to, or less than that of the parent drug.\n\nAppendix A Decision Tree Flow Diagram\n\nAppendix B Case examples of drug metabolites\n\nCase 1.\n\nFrom an initial mass balance study, a metabolite represented 1 to 2 percent of total radioactive dose in rat plasma, 5 percent in dogs, and 20 percent in humans (radioactivity of this metabolite in urine and/or feces was minimal). Based on the up-to-20-fold greater exposure in humans than in animals, nonclinical safety testing was recommended.\n\nHowever, the data generated in the general toxicology studies with the parent drug in the rat and dog suggested that the maximum doses tested produced metabolite exposures that represented at least the therapeutic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose. Also, the plasma concentrations of this metabolite measured in the in vivo genetic toxicity study, embryo-fetal development toxicity study, and carcinogenicity studies conducted with the parent drug provided adequate exposure and characterization of the metabolite. Therefore, no additional testing with the metabolite was needed.\n\nCase 2.\n\nTwo primary hydroxylated metabolites, M1 and M2, were shown to undergo further oxidation to form secondary metabolites M3 and M4 using hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes from human, monkey, rat, dog, rabbit, and mouse. This metabolic profile was later confirmed by in vivo data. The results showed the following:\n\nM1 and M4 were the predominant metabolites in human, monkey, and dog microsomes, whereas rat, mouse, and rabbit formed M2 and M3\n\nM4 was formed in humans at 4-fold higher levels than the parent drug and 75 percent of the total drug-related exposure, but M4 was formed at very low levels in rodents and only represented 20 percent of the total drug-related exposure in monkey (see Table 1)\n\nSevere drug-related and novel target organ toxicities were observed with the parent drug in monkeys but not in rats\n\nM4 was pharmacological inactive at the drug target receptors\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline  & Human (MRHD)* & Monkey & Rat \\ \\hline Total drug- & 10,220 & 24,240 & 15,135 \\ related exposure & & & \\ \\hline Parent Exposure & 1,800 & 15,000 & 12,500 \\ \\hline \\hline M4 Exposure & 7,700 & 5,000 & 135 \\ \\hline \\multicolumn{4}{l}{ AUC = area under the curve;} \\ \\multicolumn{4}{l}{MRHD = maximum recommended human dose} \\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: AUC({}_{0_24hr}) at the Maximum Dose\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe following additional studies were done with M4:\n\nSubchronic toxicity study: 3 months in rats\n\nEmbryo-fetal development study in the rats\n\nIn vitro genotoxicity testing: M4 was positive for point mutation and chromosomal aberration; the parent drug was negative\n\nBecause of the positive genotoxicity, a carcinogenicity study that included M4 was recommended\n\n4.2.3 Case 3.\n\nM2 is a phase 1 oxidative metabolite that formed up to 50 percent of total drug-related exposure in humans, 10 percent of total drug-related exposure in mice, 15 percent of total drug-related exposure in dogs, and only trace amounts in rats. In vitro metabolism studies in these species supported the in vivo findings. Based on structure activity relationship analyses, there was no reason to anticipate any difference or exaggeration in toxicity of the metabolite compared with the parent molecule. The parent drug showed no significant toxicity or identifiable target organ of toxicity in any of the animal species tested in safety assessment studies. Because disproportionate human exposure was identified, further safety testing was needed. When M2 was tested in a short-term tolerance study in the dog, it produced unexpected and significant cardiotoxicity at all doses and in all of the dogs. M2 was pharmacologically inactive at the therapeutic target receptor.\n--------------------\nContext title: Safety Testing of Drug Metabolites \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.22452916204929352", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Evaluation of Drug Metabolites (4.3)\n\nIn some cases, metabolites that have been identified in humans have not been qualified in nonclinical studies. For these metabolites, a separate evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer.\n\nEvaluation of Impurities (4.4)\n\nIt is recognized that impurity standards have been based on a negligible risk, as discussed in ICH Q3A and Q3B. Exceeding the established limits for impurities identified in these ICH guidances could be appropriate for anticancer pharmaceuticals, and a justification should be provided in the marketing application. The justification could include the disease being treated and the patient population, the nature of the parent pharmaceutical (pharmacologic properties, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, etc.), duration of treatment, and the impact of impurity reduction on manufacturing. Further, the qualification assessment could include consideration of either the dose or concentration tested in nonclinical study relative to clinical levels. For genotoxic impurities, several approaches have been used to set limits based on increase in lifetime risk of cancer. Such limits are not appropriate for pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, and justifications described above should be considered to set higher limits. Impurities that are also metabolites present in animal and/or human studies are generally considered qualified.\n\nV Notes (5)\n\nFor nonrodent studies, dose groups usually consist of at least 3 animals/sex/group, with an additional 2/sex/group for recovery, if appropriate (see section II.D (2.4)). Both sexes should generally be used, or justification should be given for specific omissions.\n\nA common approach for many small molecules is to set a start dose at 1/10 the severely toxic dose in 10% of the animals (STD 10) in rodents. If the nonrodent is the most appropriate species, then 1/6 the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) is considered an appropriate starting dose. The HNSTD is defined as the highest dose level that does not produce evidence of lethality, life-threatening toxicities or irreversible findings.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Clinical Schedule} & \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Examples of Nonclinical Treatment Schedule1,2,3,4} \\ \\hline Once every 3-4 weeks & Single dose \\ \\hline Daily for 5 days every 3 weeks & Daily for 5 days \\ \\hline Daily for 5-7 days, alternating weeks (2-dose cycles) \\ weeks & Daily for 5-7 days, alternating weeks (2-dose cycles) \\ \\hline Once a week for 3 weeks, 1 week off & Once a week for 3 weeks \\ \\hline Two or three times a week & Two or three times a week for 4 weeks \\ \\hline Daily & Daily for 4 weeks \\ \\hline Weekly & Once a week for 4-5 doses \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Examples of Treatment Schedules for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals to Support Initial Clinical Trials\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3564799427986145", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See Appendix B: Case Examples of Drug Metabolites.\n\nWe encourage identifying any differences in drug metabolism between animals used in nonclinical safety assessments and humans as early as possible during the drug development process.8 Discovering such differences in drug metabolites late in drug development can cause development delays.\n\nGenerally, metabolites identified only in human plasma or metabolites present at higher levels in humans than in any of the animal test species should be considered for safety assessment. Such metabolites are called disproportionate drug metabolites. Human metabolites that can raise a safety concern are those present at greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure at steady state.9\n\nFootnote 8: Baillie, TA, MN Cayen, H Fouda, RJ Gerson, JD Green, SJ Grossman, LJ Klunk, B LeBlanc, DG Perkins, and LA Shipley, 2002, Drug Metabolites in Safety Testing, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 182(3), 188\u2013196; and Hastings, KL, J El-Hage, A Jacobs, J Leighton, D Morse, and RE Osterberg, 2003, Drug Metabolites in Safety Testing, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 190(1), 91\u201392.\n\nFootnote 9: Exposure should be at steady state unless there is some justification for a different measure of exposure.\n\nComparison between human and animal exposure generally is based on area under the curve, but sometimes it may be more appropriate to use C({}_{\\text{max}}). See ICH M3(R2).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nanimal. In Case 3, the drug metabolite was pharmacologically inactive at the therapeutic target receptor but showed a unique toxicity not observed with the parent molecule.\n\nIdentification of Metabolites\n\nSponsors should identify the metabolic profile of the drug during the drug development process. This identification can be accomplished at different stages of development using in vitro and in vivo methods. In vitro studies can use liver microsomes, liver slices, or hepatocytes from animals and humans; these studies should generally be conducted before initiating clinical trials. In vivo metabolism study results in nonclinical test species generally should be available early in drug development, and their results will either confirm the results obtained from the in vitro studies or reveal quantitative and/or qualitative differences in metabolism across species. It is the latter situation that may pose a safety concern. Usually, sponsors have conducted human in vivo metabolism studies relatively later in drug development, but we strongly recommend that sponsors conduct in vivo metabolic evaluation in humans as early as feasible.\n\nThe adequacy of exposure to drug metabolites that are present at lower levels in animals used in nonclinical studies is determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally, systemic exposure is assessed by measuring the concentration of the parent drug at steady state in serum or plasma.12 However, when measurements cannot be made in plasma of the test species for any reason, adequate exposure can be verified in other biological matrices such as urine, feces, or bile.13 We encourage sponsors to contact the FDA early in drug development to discuss these issues.\n\nFootnote 12: Although the drug metabolite of toxicological concern usually is one circulating in plasma at greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure, other metabolites also can elicit safety concern. For example, a drug metabolite representing greater than 10 percent of urinary excretion relative to the bioavailable dose, or a human fecal metabolite in cases where biliary elimination is the predominant route of excretion in humans, may reflect potential localized renal or bile duct toxicity, respectively. The sponsor should discuss with the appropriate FDA review division the need for further characterization in these instances, which are addressed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 13: See the ICH guidance for industry SSA Guidance: Note for Guidance on Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies: Focus on Microsampling \u2014 Questions and Answers (March 2018).\n\nGeneral Considerations for Nonclinical Study Design\n\nWhen designing a nonclinical study for a disproportionate drug metabolite, one should consider the following factors:\n\nSimilarity of the metabolite to the parent molecule\n\nPharmacological or chemical class\n\nSolubility\n\nStability in stomach pH\n\nPhase 1 versus phase 2 metabolite\n\nRelative amounts detected in humans versus the amounts detected in animals\n\nAdditional factors to be considered include the proposed drug indication and patient population (e.g., nonclinical studies can be abbreviated for serious indications such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), the proposed duration of use (short term, intermittent use, chronic), and the levels of exposure at the therapeutic dose.\n\nIV Recommended studies for assessing the safety of metabolites\n\nGood laboratory practice guidelines apply to the nonclinical studies with the drug metabolite designed to evaluate safety (21 CFR part 58). Sponsors may need to conduct the following studies to assess the safety of the disproportionate drug metabolite.\n\nGeneral Toxicity Studies\n\nThe potential toxicity of a disproportionate drug metabolite should be evaluated to enable comparisons between the metabolite and its parent drug. The duration of the general toxicity study with direct dosing of the metabolite should follow the recommendations listed in ICH M3(R2). Sponsors should investigate the toxicity of the drug metabolite at multiples of the human exposure or at least at levels comparable to those measured in humans. We also recommend using the parent drug's intended clinical route of administration. However, with justification, one can use other routes to achieve sufficient exposure to the disproportionate metabolite. If the clinical route is oral, it is important to verify the stability of the metabolite in the stomach environment. It is crucial to gather toxicokinetic data from this type of study to ensure adequate exposure.\n\nGenotoxicity Studies\n\nThe potential genotoxicity of the drug metabolite should be assessed in an in vitro assay that detects point mutations and in another assay that detects chromosomal aberrations. It is important that these assays be conducted according to the recommendations in the ICH guidance for industry S2(R1) Genotoxicity Testing and Data Interpretation for Pharmaceuticals Intended for Human Use (June 2012). If one or both of the in vitro tests are equivocal and/or positive, results from a complete standard battery of genotoxicity studies may be needed.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Development Toxicity Studies\n\nWhen a drug is intended for use in a population that includes women of childbearing potential, sponsors should conduct embryo-fetal development toxicity studies with the drug metabolite. We may ask for other reproductive toxicity studies on a case-by-case basis, depending on results of the general toxicity and embryo-fetal development studies. Sponsors should conduct reproductive toxicity studies in accordance with the ICH guidances on reproductive toxicity. Sometimes the conduct of an embryo-fetal development toxicity study in only one species that forms the drug metabolite can be justified.\n\nCarcinogenicity Studies\n\nCarcinogenicity studies should be conducted on metabolites of drugs that are administered continuously for at least 6 months or that are used intermittently to treat chronic or recurrent conditions when the carcinogenic potential of the metabolite cannot be adequately evaluated from carcinogenicity studies conducted with the parent drug. Sponsors should conduct a single carcinogenicity study or an alternative bioassay in accordance with the ICH guidances for industry SIA The Need for Long-term Rodent Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals (March 1996), SIB Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals (July 1997), and SIC(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies (September 2008).\n\nV Timing of Safety Assessments\n\nEarly identification of disproportionate drug metabolites can provide clear justification for nonclinical testing in animals, assist in interpreting and planning clinical studies, and prevent delays in drug development. If toxicity studies of a drug metabolite are warranted, sponsors should complete studies and provide study reports to the FDA before beginning large-scale clinical trials.\n\nTo optimize and expedite drug development for serious or life-threatening diseases other than cancer (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, human immunodeficiency virus), the number and type of nonclinical studies for the drug metabolites can be modified on a case-by-case basis for those drugs with major beneficial therapeutic advances and for drugs for illnesses that lack an approved effective therapy. Sponsors should contact the appropriate review division to discuss such situations.\n\nGlossary\n\nDisproportionate drug metabolite -- A metabolite present only in humans or present at higher plasma concentrations in humans than in the animals used in nonclinical studies.

In making a decision to allow enrollment of a subject who does not understand English into a research protocol without waiting for a written translation of the long form, the investigator (and whenever feasible the IRB chairperson or designee) should consider whether the consent process, under this circumstance, will provide the subject with sufficient opportunity to understand the information being presented. If consent is sought and the investigator believes that the prospective subject has not understood the information presented, then the individual should not be enrolled in the research.\n\n2.4 Step 2 - Obtain and Document the Subject's Informed Consent in Accordance with FDA Regulations at 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27 Using a Translated Short Form and the English Language Version of the Long Form as the Written Summary\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2), informed consent is documented using a short form that has been translated into a language understandable to the prospective subject and approved by the IRB. As a prerequisite to using this procedure, the investigator must have available a short form written in a language understandable to the prospective subject or LAR and previously approved by the IRB (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.27(a)). To meet this prerequisite, the IRB mustrequire that the sponsor or investigator arrange for translation of a generic short form into a language understandable by the prospective subject or LAR, and the IRB must have approved the prospective use of such short forms for enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, as needed. Additionally, the IRB must approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The IRB-approved English long form often serves as this written summary. The translator should be fluent in both English and in the subject's language. It may be appropriate to have a translator available for all subsequent study visits to relay information between the subject and study personnel.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining and documenting the subject's informed consent with a translated short form and an English version of the long form includes the following:\n\nThe investigator (or their designee) obtaining informed consent, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed (e.g., if the investigator is not bilingual), provides orally to the subject the elements of informed consent required by FDA regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 and any additional pertinent information included in the IRB-approved English version of the long form. This presentation may be an oral translation of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. The oral presentation must be in language understandable to the subject (21 CFR 50.20). The investigator, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed, answers any questions from the prospective subject. There must be a witness to the oral presentation who must not be the person obtaining informed consent (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Furthermore, FDA strongly recommends the witness be fluent in the language of the oral presentation. The witness must, at a minimum, have sufficient proficiency in the language of the oral presentation to be able to attest to the information that was to the presented orally to the prospective participant (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2).) In addition, if possible, the witness should not be related to the subject.\n\nAt the time informed consent is sought, the subject is given the IRB-approved translated short form and a copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form, which serves as the written summary.\n\nThe short form is signed and dated by the subject or LAR.\n\nThe witness signs both the short form and the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. (Note that when an interpreter assists the person obtaining consent, the interpreter may serve as the witness, but is not required to do so.)\n\nThe person actually obtaining consent signs the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form.\n\nStep 3 - Take Additional Actions Following Subject Enrollment\n\nAfter the subject has been enrolled in the research, the investigator takes the following additional actions:1. If a subject was enrolled in the research using an untranslated long form to serve as the written summary, and if the investigator did not consult with the IRB chairperson (or designee) prior to enrollment of the subject who does not understand English, the investigator should promptly notify the IRB chairperson (or designee) that such a subject was enrolled.\n2. The investigator must obtain a translated copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form that served as the written summary, which should be done promptly. The investigator promptly submits it to the IRB for review and approval. Once the translated long form/written summary is approved by the IRB, the investigator must provide it to the subject or LAR and should do so as soon as possible. FDA considers this step essential to the requirement that informed consent be documented by the use of a written consent document and that the subject be provided a copy (21 CFR 50.27). Many of the clinical investigations regulated by FDA involve ongoing interventions and may involve long-term follow-up. For this reason, translation of the long form is critically important as a means of providing subjects or their LAR an ongoing source of information understandable to them.\n\nAdditionally, as noted above in Frequently Asked Question#3, FDA recommends that whenever subjects who do not understand English are involved in research, appropriate interpreter services be made available throughout the course of the research.\n\nix.1.6 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\n\nAlthough a competent person who does not read and write well can give informed consent and enroll in a clinical investigation, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB should consider whether any modifications to the informed consent process are necessary to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable.\n\nFor subjects with apparent low literacy and/or low numeracy, oral presentation of the information contained in the consent document is especially important. When the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR, the IRB may want to consider approving the use of a short form and written summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)), which includes a witness to the oral presentation of the informed consent elements who also signs the consent document (see _section_III.E.4.b, \"Short Form\"). It should be noted that, even if the information is presented orally, the subject or the subject's LAR is required to sign the consent form (whether the long form or short form is used) unless the IRB has waived documentation of informed consent under 21 CFR 56.109(c).\n\nSubjects who cannot write can indicate their consent by \"making their mark\" on the consent document, in lieu of signing and dating the consent form when consistent with applicable law. In these situations, a note should be included in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21CFR 812.140(a)(3) indicating the reason for the lack of a signature and date as required by 21 CFR 50.27(a). The date consent was obtained should be recorded in this note.\n\nvi.2.7 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\n\nA person with physical or sensory disabilities (for example, physically unable to talk or write or has hearing or visual loss) can enroll in a clinical investigation if competent and able to signal consent consistent with applicable law. Enrolling such subjects into a clinical investigation does not require a LAR to be involved with the informed consent process or to sign the consent document unless required by State or local law. The records relating to the clinical investigation must include documentation of the informed consent process (21 CFR 50.27) unless excepted under 21 CFR 56.109(c). FDA recommends including in subject case histories required under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3) a description of the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to take part in the clinical investigation and how questions were answered. FDA recommends that investigators provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services when necessary to meet the specific needs of the study population.80 For example, for subjects with vision disabilities, the investigator could use an audio recording of the contents of the consent form or a consent form with enlarged font, depending on the degree of impairment.\n\nFootnote 80: FDA strongly encourages stakeholders to ensure that informed consent documents are accessible to individuals with disabilities. To the extent an organization receives Federal financial assistance from HHS, the organization must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This guidance provides information to assist IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\u2019s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. It does not provide guidance on how to comply with any regulatory obligations stemming from a source outside of the statutes FDA administers and FDA\u2019s regulations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.367149353027344", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject's rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the \"compensation\" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n\n51. Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n\nThe signed informed consent document is the written record of the consent interview. Study subjects are given a copy of the consent to be used as a reference document to reinforce their understanding of the study and, if desired, to consult with their physician or family members about the study.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, the consent document must be in language understandable to the subject. When the prospective subject is fluent in English, and the consent interview is conducted in English, the consent document should be in English. However, when the study subject population includes non-English speaking people so that the clinical investigator or the IRB anticipates that the consent interviews are likely to be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should assure that a translated consent form is prepared and that the translation is accurate.\n\nA consultant may be utilized to assure that the translation is correct. A copy of the translated consent document must be given to each appropriate subject. While a translator may be used to facilitate conversation with the subject, routine ad hoc translation of the consent document may not be substituted for a written translation.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheets: \"A Guide to Informed Consent Documents\" and \"Informed Consent and the Clinical Investigator\"\n\n52. Is it acceptable for the consent document to say specimens are \"donated\"?\n\nWhat about a separate donation statement? It would be acceptable for the consent to say that specimens are to be used for research purposes. However, the word \"donation\" implies abandonment of rights to the \"property\". 21 CFR 50.20 prohibits requiring subjects to waive or appear to waive any rights as a condition for participation in the study. Whether or not the wording is contained in \"the actual consent form\" is immaterial. All study-related documents must be submitted to the IRB for review. Any separate \"donation\" agreement is regarded to be part of the informed consent documentation, and must be in compliance with 21 CFR 50.\n\n53. Do informed consent forms have to justify fees charged to study subjects?\n\nFDA does not require the consent to contain justification of charges.\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\n54. Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized. An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.\n\n55. Does a clinical investigation involving a marketed product require IRB review and approval?\n\nYes, if the investigation is governed by FDA regulations [see 21 CFR 56.101, 56.102(c), 312.2(b)(1), 361.1, 601.2, and 812.2]. Also, see the information sheet entitled \"Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs and Biologics\" for more information.\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nWhich FDA office may an IRB contact to determine whether an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) is required for a study of a test article?\n\nFor drugs, the IRB may contact the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Communications, Division of Drug Information at (301) 796-3400.\n\nFor biological products, contact the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Communication, Outreach and Development, at (800)-835-4709 or (301) 827-1800.\n\nFor medical devices, contact the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Staff, Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at (301) 796-5640.\n\n57. What happens during an FDA inspection of an IRB?\n\nFDA field investigators interview institutional officials and examine the IRB records to determine compliance with FDA regulations. Also, see the information sheet entitled \"FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections\" for a complete description of the inspection process.\n\n58. Does a treatment IND/IDE [21 CFR 312.34/812.36 ] require prior IRB approval?\n\nTest articles given to human subjects under a treatment IND/IDE require prior IRB approval, with two exceptions. If a life-threatening emergency exists, as defined by 21 CFR 56.102(d), the procedures described in 56.104(c) (\"Exemptions from IRB Requirement\") may be followed. In addition, FDA may grant the sponsor or sponsor/investigator a waiver of the IRB requirement in accord with 21 CFR 56.105. An IRB may still choose to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. For further information see the information sheets entitled\"Emergency Use of an Investigational Drug or Biologic,\" \"Emergency Use of Unapproved Medical Devices,\" \"Waiver of IRB Requirements\" and \"Treatment use of Investigational Drugs and Biologics.\"\n\n59. How have the FDA policies on enrollment of special populations changed?\n\nOn July 22, 1993, the FDA published the Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs, in the Federal Register [58 FR 39406]. The guideline was developed to ensure that the drug development process provides adequate information about the effects of drugs and biological products in women. For further information, see the information sheet entitled \"Evaluation of Gender Differences in Clinical Investigations.\"\n\nOn December 13, 1994, FDA published a final rule on the labeling of prescription drugs for pediatric populations [59 FR 64240]. The rule [21 CFR 201.57] encourages sponsors to include pediatric subjects in clinical trials so that more complete information about the use of drugs and biological products in the pediatric population can be developed.\n\n6o. What is a medical device?\n\nA medical device is any instrument, apparatus, or other similar or related article, including component, part, or accessory, which is: (a) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them; (b) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in humans or other animals; or (c) intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body or in animals; and does not achieve any of its principal intended purposes through chemical action within or on the human body or in animals and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its principal intended purposes.\n\nApproximately 1,700 types of medical devices are regulated by FDA. The range of devices is broad and diverse, including bandages, thermometers, ECG electrodes, IUDs, cardiac pacemakers, and hemodialysis machines. For further information, see the information sheets entitled \"Medical Devices,\" \"Frequently Asked Questions about IRB Review of Medical Devices\" and \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.\"\n\n61. Are in vitro diagnostic products medical devices?\n\nYes. The definition of a \"device\" includes in vitro diagnostic products - devices that aid in the diagnosis of disease or medical/physiological conditions (e.g., pregnancy) by using human or animal components to cause chemical reactions, fermentation, and the like. A few diagnostic products are intended for use in controlling other regulated products (such as those used to screen the blood supply for transfusion-transmitted diseases) and are regulated as biological products.\n\n62. What are the IRB's general obligations towards intraocular lens (IOL) clinical investigations?An IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of all IOL clinical investigations. Each individual IOL style is subject to a separate review by the IRB. This does not, however, preclude the IRB from using prior experience with other IOL investigations in considering the comparative merits of a new lens style. All IOL studies are also subject to FDA approval.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.946074485778809", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: How do you obtain informed consent from someone who speaks and understands English but cannot read? Illiterate persons who understand English may have the consent read to them and \"make their mark,\" if appropriate under applicable state law. The 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) requirements for signature of a witness to the consent process and signature of the person conducting consent interview must be followed, if a \"short form\" is used. Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do.\n\nThe IRB should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to coercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated, see 21 CFR 56.111(b).\n\n41. Must a witness observe the entire consent interview or only the signature of the subject?\n\nFDA does not require the signature of a witness when the subject reads and is capable of understanding the consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(b)(1). The intended purpose is to have the witness present during the entire consent interview and to attest to the accuracy of the presentation and the apparent understanding of the subject. If the intent of the regulation were only to attest to the validity of the subject's signature, witnessing would also be required when the subject reads the consent.\n\n42. Should the sponsor prepare a model informed consent document?\n\nAlthough not required by the IND regulations, the sponsor provides a service to the clinical investigator and the IRB when it prepares suggested study-specific wording for the scientific and technical content of the consent document. However, the IRB has the responsibility and authority to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of all of the wording in the consent, see 21 CFR 56.109(a), 111(a)(4) and 111(a)(5). If an IRB insists on wording the sponsor cannot accept, the sponsor may decide not to conduct the study at that site. For medical device studies that are conducted under an IDE, copies of all forms and informational materials to be provided to subjects to obtain informed consent must be submitted to FDA as part of the IDE, see 21 CFR 812.25(g).\n\n43. Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n\nFor investigational devices, the informed consent is a required part of the IDE submission. It is, therefore, approved by FDA as part of the IDE application. When an IRB makes substantive changes in the document, FDA reapproval is required and the sponsor is necessarily involved in this process.\n\nFDA regulations for other products do not specifically require the sponsor to review IRB approved consent documents. However, most sponsors do conduct such reviews to assure the wording is acceptable to the sponsor.\n\n44. Are there alternatives to obtaining informed consent from a subject?\n\nThe regulations generally require that the investigator obtain informed consent from subjects. Investigators also may obtain informed consent from a legally authorized representative of the subject. FDA recognizes that a durable power of attorney might suffice as identifying a legally authorized representative under some state and local laws. For example, a subject might have designated an individual to provide consent with regard to health care decisions through a durable power of attorney and have specified that the individual also has the power to make decisions on entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding who is a legally authorized representative. Therefore, the IRB should assure that the consent procedures comply with state and local laws, including assurance that the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\"\n\nAlternatives 1 and 2 are provided for in the regulations and are appropriate. Alternative 3 allows a designated individual to provide consent for a patient with regard to health care decisions and is appropriate when it specifically includes entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding substituted consent. Therefore, the IRB must assure itself that the substituted consent procedures comply with state and local law, including assurance the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\n\n45 When should study subjects be informed of changes in the study?\n\nProtocol amendments must receive IRB review and approval before they are implemented, unless an immediate change is necessary to eliminate an apparent hazard to the subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). Those subjects who are presently enrolled and actively participating in the study should be informed of the change if it might relate to the subjects' willingness to continue their participation in the study (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). FDA does not require reconsenting of subjects that have completed their active participation in the study, or of subjects who are still actively participating when the change will not affect their participation, for example when the change will be implemented only for subsequently enrolled subjects.\n\n61 Informed Consent Document Content\n\nMay an IRB require that the sponsor of the study and/or the clinical investigator be identified on the study's consent document?\n\nYes. The FDA requirements for informed consent are the minimum basic elements of informed consent that must be presented to a research subject [21 CFR 50.25]. An IRB may require inclusion of any additional information which it considers important to a subject's decision to participate in a research study [21 CFR 56.109(b)].\n\n63 Does FDA require the informed consent document to contain a space for assent by children?\n\nNo, however, many investigators and IRBs consider it standard practice to obtain the agreement of older children who can understand the circumstances before enrolling them in research. While the FDA regulations do not specifically address enrollment of children (other than to include them as a class of vulnerable subjects), the basic requirement of 21 CFR 50.20 applies, i.e., the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative must be obtained before enrollment. Parents, legal guardians and/or others may have the ability to give permission to enroll children in research, depending on applicable state and local law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted. (Note: permission to enroll in research is not the same as permission to provide medical treatment.) IRBs generally require investigators to obtain the permission of one or both of the parents or guardian (as appropriate) and the assent of children who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved. Some IRBs require two documents, a fully detailed explanation for parents and older children to read and sign, and a shorter, simpler one for younger children. [For research supported by DHHS, the additional protections at 45 CFR 46 Subpart D are also required. The Subpart D regulations provide appropriate guidance for all other pediatric studies.] On April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Assent by children is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n48 Does FDA require the signature of children on informed consent documents?\n\nAs indicated above, researchers may seek assent of children of various ages. Older children may be well acquainted with signing documents through prior experience with testing, licensing and/or other procedures normally encountered in their lives. Signing a form to give their assent for research would not be perceived as unusual and would be reasonable. Younger children, however, may never have had the experience of signing a document. For these children requiring a signature may not be appropriate, and some other technique to verify assent could be used. For example, a third party may verify, by signature, that the assent of the child was obtained.\n\nAs noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject's rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the \"compensation\" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.059796333312988", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: In the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject's LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, \"Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24.

Technologies are available that may serve as an alternative to the paper consent form in the informed consent process.47 Parties interested in pursuing alternative methods of obtaining informed consent should discuss their plan with their IRB and are welcome to contact FDA as needed for advice.48\n\nFootnote 48: Questions related to alternative methods of obtaining informed consent can be directed to the Office of Clinical Policy at gcpaquestions@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nEven in the context of paper consent forms, there may be certain circumstances when an alternative to a face-to-face consent discussion may be appropriate. For example, such an alternative may be appropriate\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]\n\nbe described and noted in subject case histories required to maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).\n\niv.1.3 Requirement for Dating Consent Form\n\nIn addition to signing the consent form, the subject or the subject's LAR must enter the date of signature on the form (21 CFR 50.27(a)) to allow confirmation that the subject or the subject's LAR provided consent prior to participation in the clinical investigation, as required by 21 CFR 50.20. In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject's case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject's case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject's copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, \u201cCoercion and Undue Influence\u201d.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject's LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject's LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\u201d and Frequently Asked Question #7, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\u201d In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?\u201d, Frequently Asked Question #4, \u201cWhat process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?\u201d, and Frequently Asked Question #5, \u201cWhat process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?\u201d\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject's LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: \u201cThe fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the \u2018form\u2019 provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.\u201d\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject's consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject's questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject's LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.5926228761672974", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.39553576707839966", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: vi.2.7 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\n\nA person with physical or sensory disabilities (for example, physically unable to talk or write or has hearing or visual loss) can enroll in a clinical investigation if competent and able to signal consent consistent with applicable law. Enrolling such subjects into a clinical investigation does not require a LAR to be involved with the informed consent process or to sign the consent document unless required by State or local law. The records relating to the clinical investigation must include documentation of the informed consent process (21 CFR 50.27) unless excepted under 21 CFR 56.109(c). FDA recommends including in subject case histories required under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3) a description of the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to take part in the clinical investigation and how questions were answered. FDA recommends that investigators provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services when necessary to meet the specific needs of the study population.80 For example, for subjects with vision disabilities, the investigator could use an audio recording of the contents of the consent form or a consent form with enlarged font, depending on the degree of impairment.\n\nFootnote 80: FDA strongly encourages stakeholders to ensure that informed consent documents are accessible to individuals with disabilities. To the extent an organization receives Federal financial assistance from HHS, the organization must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This guidance provides information to assist IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\u2019s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. It does not provide guidance on how to comply with any regulatory obligations stemming from a source outside of the statutes FDA administers and FDA\u2019s regulations.\n\nvi.2.8 What should be considered when enrolling adult subjects with impaired consent capacity?\n\nConsent capacity is a person's ability to understand information relevant to the decision to enroll in a study, that is, to weigh the risks and benefits of participation, to appreciate the available alternatives (including nonparticipation), to reach an informed and voluntary decision regarding participation, and to communicate that decision. Consent capacity also depends, in part, on the complexity of the decision that confronts the prospective subject, which may take into account such factors as study design, risks, and anticipated benefits.\n\nImpaired consent capacity may involve partial impairment, impairment that fluctuates over time, or complete impairment. For example, consent capacity can be affected by a wide range of disorders and conditions, such as dementia, stroke, traumatic brain injury, intellectual and developmental disabilities, serious mental illness, intoxication, and delirium.\n\nEnrollment of subjects with partial impairment may require modifications to the consent form and process to enable those subjects to consent on their own behalf. When a subject's consent capacity is sufficiently impaired that the subject is unable to provide legally effective informed consent, the subject may not be enrolled unless the subject's LAR consents on the subject's behalf (21 CFR 50.3(l) and 50.20).\n\nIRBs and investigators should carefully consider whether the inclusion in research of individuals who lack consent capacity is ethically appropriate and scientifically necessary. Whenever individuals with impaired consent capacity (partial, fluctuating, or complete) are or may be enrolled in clinical studies, ethical and procedural challenges arise. Considerations that may help address these challenges and provide additional safeguards include:\n\nAssessing consent capacity of prospective subjects, for example, through use of an independent, qualified professional and a process that includes: (1) documentation of elements of capacity (such as understanding information, showing evidence of choice, showing rational reasoning, understanding the nature of the situation, and showing reasonable understanding of outcome of choice); and (2) assessments at the time of consent, at periodic intervals, and when a subject's family member expresses concern about the subject's study participation.\n\nEstablishing a waiting period in the decision-making process to allow additional time for decision-making.\n\nUsing methods to enhance consent capacity, for example through (1) simplification and/or repetition of information, (2) involvement of a subject advocate or trusted family member/friend to assist when sharing information about the clinical investigation, and (3) refraining from discussions during periods of heightened impairment, when possible.\n\nAssessing a subject's understanding after information about the clinical investigation has been imparted, for example, through use of a questionnaire.\n\nRe-assessing consent capacity after initiation of the clinical investigation for subjects with progressive disorders whose cognition may decline.\n\nInvolving an LAR either initially or later in the clinical investigation if consent capacity diminishes.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:58]\n\ndesires and abilities. In a situation in which a prospective subject is capable of providing informed consent at the onset of a clinical investigation but is expected to become less capable of providing continued consent as the research progresses (e.g., a long-term clinical trial for Alzheimer's), consideration should be given at the start of the trial to having subjects designate an individual to serve as their LAR once the subjects' conditions warrant it.\n\nHow can informed consent be obtained through electronic methods?\n\nFDA supports the use of electronic processes to obtain informed consent.82 Electronic media are being used to provide information usually contained within a paper informed consent form, to evaluate the subject's comprehension of the information presented, and to document the consent of the subject or the subject's LAR. Electronic processes to obtain informed consent may use an interactive interface for the informed consent process, which may facilitate the subject's ability to retain and comprehend the information. Furthermore, these electronic processes may also promote timely entry of any electronic informed consent into a study database and facilitate collection of the subject's informed consent from remote locations. Additional guidance on the use of electronic informed consent in clinical investigations can be found in the FDA guidance entitled, \"Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations - Questions and Answers\".83\n\nFootnote 82: Please see footnote 80.\n\nFootnote 83: See FDA \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations \u2013 Questions and Answers,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers.\n\nCan a subject participate in more than one clinical investigation simultaneously?\n\nSome subjects may wish to participate simultaneously in more than one clinical trial. Enrollment in more than one clinical investigation could increase risks to subjects, particularly because they may be exposed to more than one investigational product for which the safety profile may not be well understood, and there may be potential drug or device interactions. Also, subjects may find it difficult to understand the risks and potential benefits or meet the demands of multiple protocols. FDA generally discourages enrollment in multiple investigations, although there are some circumstances in which co-enrollment may be appropriate (e.g., rare disease studies that are evaluating different aspects of the condition and involvement in one study does not affect the other study). In addition, this recommendation does not apply to certain appropriately designed studies, such as a clinical investigation of a novel drug and a companion in vitro diagnostic device that is essential for the safe and effective use of the drug.\n\nSponsors generally include prohibitions related to the use of concomitant medications in the protocol or restrict (via exclusion criteria) inclusion of subjects who have participated in another clinical investigation within a specified period of time (for example, the washout period before a subject can enroll in a new clinical investigation). Implied in the prohibitions on concomitant medications is the idea that subjects should generally not participate in more than one clinical investigation at a time. Investigators should inquire about multiple enrollments and, when appropriate, discourage this practice in the consent document and during informed consent discussions. Further, when appropriate, the risks of participating simultaneously in more than one clinical investigation should be discussed with subjects during the consent process but do not necessarily need to be included in the informed consent form.\n\n12 How should data be handled when an enrolled subject decides to withdraw from a trial?\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6634523868560791"], "As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period.

While increases in QT/QTc to >500 ms or of >60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds forpotential discontinuation, the exact criteria chosen for a given trial will depend on the risk-tolerance level considered appropriate for the indication and patient group in question.\n\nThe Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms. The study is typically carried out in healthy volunteers (as opposed to individuals at increased risk of arrhythmias) and is used to determine whether or not the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc interval in target patient populations should be studied intensively during later stages of drug development. It is not intended to identify drugs as being pro-arrhythmic. Although data are limited, it is not expected that the results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' would be affected by ethnic factors.\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' would typically be conducted early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials, although the precise timing will depend on the specifics of the drug under development. It would usually not be the first study, as it is important to have basic clinical data for its design and conduct, including tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Some drugs might not be suitable for study in healthy volunteers because of issues related to tolerability (e.g., neuroleptic agents, chemotherapeutics).\n\nThe results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' will influence the amount of information collected in later stages of development:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.030981551855802536", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The QT/QTc interval data should be presented both as analyses of central tendency (e.g., means, medians) and categorical analyses. Both can provide relevant information on clinical risk assessment.\n\niv.1.1 Analyses of Central Tendency (3.2.1)\n\nThe effect of an investigational drug on the QT/QTc interval is most commonly analyzed using the largest time - matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Additional approaches to the assessment of central tendency could include analysis of changes occurring around the Cmax for each individual. This last analysis would be especially important if the drug has large between-subject variability in the rate of absorption or metabolism.\n\niv.1.2 Categorical Analyses (3.2.2)\n\nCategorical analyses of QT/QTc interval data are based on the number and percentage of patients meeting or exceeding some predefined upper limit value. Clinically noteworthy QT/QTc interval changes might be defined in terms of absolute QT/QTc intervals or changes from baseline. Separate analyses should be provided for patients with normal and elevated baseline QT/QTc intervals. As with all QT/QTc interval analyses, categorical analyses are most informative when it is possible to compare the rate of supra-threshold readings in the treatment and control groups.\n\nThere is no consensus concerning the choice of upper limit values for absolute QT/QTc interval and changes from baseline. While lower limits increase the false-positive rate, higher limits increase the risk of failing to detect a signal of concern. In clinical trials, a prolongation of QTc (>500) ms during therapy has been a threshold of particular concern. Multiple analyses using different limits are a reasonable approach to this uncertainty, including:\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>450)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>480)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>500)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval increases from baseline (\\star 30)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval increases from baseline (\\star 60)\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnalysis of Relationship Between Drug Exposure and QT/QTc Interval Changes (3.2.3)\n\nEstablishing the relationship of drug concentrations to changes in QT/QTc interval may provide additional information to assist the planning and interpretation of studies assessing cardiac repolarization. This area is under active investigation.\n\nMorphological Analyses of ECG Waveforms (3.3)\n\nWhile the predictive value of changes in ECG morphology, such as the development of U waves, has not been established, morphological abnormalities should be described and the data presented in terms of the number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group having changes from baseline that represent the appearance or worsening of the morphological abnormality. Typically these data will be obtained as a part of the \"thorough QT/QTc study.\"\n\nIV Adverse Events (4)\n\nIn addition to data on changes in ECG intervals, adverse event data can be another source of information on proarrhythmic potential, including:\n\nPremature discontinuations and dosage adjustments during clinical studies\n\nPostmarketing adverse event reports if available\n\nClinical Trial Adverse Events (4.1)\n\nAlthough drug-induced prolongation of the QT/QTc interval is usually asymptomatic, an increased rate of certain adverse events in patients taking an investigational agent can signal potential proarrhythmic effects. The rates of the following clinical events should be compared in the treated and control patients, particularly when there is evidence of an effect on the QT/QTc interval:\n\nTorsade de pointes\n\nSudden death\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nVentricular fibrillation and flutter\n\nSyncope\n\nSeizures\n\nTorsade de pointes is very infrequently captured in clinical databases, even those for drugs known to have significant proarrhythmic effects. Given this, the failure to observe an episode of TdP in a drug application database is not considered sufficient grounds for dismissing the possible arrhythmogenic risks of a drug when these are suspected on the basis of ECG and other clinical data. The other adverse events listed above, while less specific for an effect on cardiac repolarization, are more commonly captured in clinical trials, and an imbalance in their frequency between study groups can signal a potential proarrhythmic effect of the investigational agent. Sub-group analyses should be conducted in terms of age, gender, pre-existing cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, and concomitant medications. Comparing cause-specific ratesof death is difficult, but a difference in the fraction of total deaths qualifying as \"sudden\" has also been proposed as a marker for proarrhythmic potential.\n\nDetailed patient narratives should be provided for all serious cardiac adverse events, as would be the case for any serious event or events leading to discontinuation. In assessing the possible causal relationship of drug-induced QT/QTc interval prolongation to the event, attention should be directed to considerations such as temporal relationship and ECG results collected at the time of the event. As the QT/QTc interval is subject to considerable fluctuation, a possible role for QT/QTc interval prolongation should not be dismissed on the basis of normal on-therapy ECG measurements performed prior to, or near the time of the adverse event. In addition to an appropriate adverse reaction report, patients with marked QT/QTc prolongation or an episode of TdP might provide useful information on risk management. When identified, they should therefore be examined closely for other risk factors (e.g., genetic predisposition, see section IV.C (4.3)). Rechallenge with the investigational drug under appropriately monitored conditions can provide useful information on dose- and concentration-response relationships.\n\nIn evaluating the safety database of a new drug, consideration should be given to the extent to which the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient eligibility might have influenced the study population with respect to the risk of QT/QTc interval prolongation and associated adverse events (e.g., exclusion of patients with cardiac co-morbidities or renal/hepatic impairment, prohibition of diuretics as concomitant medications). Ideally, the major clinical studies should include an adequate representation of female and elderly patients, as well as patients with co-morbidities and concomitant medications typical of the expected user population.\n\nIf a subject experiences symptoms or ECG findings suggestive of an arrhythmia during a clinical trial, immediate evaluation by a cardiac specialist is recommended, both for the purposes of treating the patient and for discussions related to continuation/ re-institution of the therapy.\n\nPremature Discontinuations or Dosage Reductions (4.2)\n\nParticular attention should be directed to subjects or patients who are discontinued from clinical trials due to QT/QTc interval prolongation. Information should be provided on the basis for premature discontinuation of the patient (e.g., a QT/QTc interval value in excess of a protocol-defined upper limit, occurrence of QT/QTc interval prolongation in association with symptoms of arrhythmia), as well as the dose and duration of treatment, plasma levels if available, demographic characteristics, and the presence or absence of risk factors for arrhythmia.\n\nDosage reductions prompted by QT/QTc interval prolongation should also be documented.\n\nPharmacokine Considerations (4.3)\n\nMany forms of Long QT Syndrome are now known to be linked to mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channel proteins. Because of incomplete penetrance, not all carriers of mutated ion channel genes will manifest QT/QTc interval prolongation in screening ECG evaluations. Polymorphisms can affect ion channels, leading to an increased sensitivity to drugs that affect repolarization. Genotyping patients who experience marked prolongation of the QT/QTc or TdP while on drug therapy should be considered.\n\nPostmarketing Adverse Event Reports (4.4)\n\nBecause documented cases of TdP are relatively rare, even for drugs that prolong the QT/QTc, they are often not reported until large populations of patients have received the agent in postmarketing settings. The available postmarketing adverse event data should be examined for evidence of QT/QTc interval prolongation and TdP and for adverse events possibly related to QT/QTc interval prolongation, such as cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). A well-characterized episode of TdP has a high probability of being related to drug use, whereas the other events that are reported more commonly would be of particular concern if reported in a population at low risk for them (e.g., young men experiencing sudden death).\n\nV Regulatory Implications, Labeling, and Risk Management Strategies (5)\n\nRelevance of QT/QTc Interval Prolonging Effects to the Evaluation Process (5.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4088916480541229", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect.

The ICH E14 guidance states (in section III (3), page 12) that analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval changes is under active investigation. Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)\n\nConcentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n\nThere are many different types of models for the analysis of concentration-response data, including descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E({}_{\\text{max}}) models), or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. Itis recognized that concentration-response analyses of the same data using models with different underlying assumptions can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the modeling methods and assumptions, criteria for model selection, rationale for model components, and potential for pooling of data across studies be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Prospective specification of model characteristics (e.g., structural model, objective criteria, goodness of fit) based on knowledge of the pharmacology is recommended whenever possible. On occasion, the QT effect is not a direct function of plasma concentration. For example, drugs that cause QT prolongation as a result of changes in protein synthesis or trafficking or drugs with accumulation into myocardial tissues might demonstrate hysteresis. Testing for model assumptions, hysteresis (a plot of data by-time point and a hysteresis loop plot), and goodness of fit should be documented.\n\nConcentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity--multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites--contributes to the QTc effect.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nConcentration-response data would not necessarily come from a dedicated QT study, nor would it necessarily come from a single study. However, there are several new and important considerations that are described below.\n\nData can be acquired from first-in human studies, multiple-ascending dose studies, or other studies. Additional data would be useful to ensure information on exposure well above the exposure at the maximum therapeutic dose, to cover the impact of accumulation with repeated dosing, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, organ dysfunction, or genetically impaired metabolism. It is anticipated that one would collect new data to add to previous data, if appropriate, rather than use new data for independent analyses.\n\nEfficient concentration-response analysis using data acquired in studies with other purposes requires as much quality control as is needed for a dedicated study. This includes robust, high-quality ECG recording and analysis sufficient to support a valid assay for ECG intervals (see the E14 guidance and Question Q1 (1.1)).\n\nIf there is an intention to pool data from multiple studies, it is important to test for heterogeneity.\n\nIf there are data characterizing the response at a sufficiently high multiple of the clinically relevant exposure (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.2 (2.2.2)), a separate positive control would not be necessary.\n\nDecision-making\n\nBoth the intersection-union test and the concentration-response analysis can estimate the maximum effect of a drug treatment on the QTc interval, but they are not used to test the same hypothesis. As mentioned above, inspection of the time course of QT prolongation is important.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nHowever, hypothesis testing based on a by-time point analysis (intersection-union test or point estimate and confidence intervals) is inappropriate in studies designed for a concentration-response analysis, if not powered to assess the magnitude of QT prolongation for each time point.\n\nWhen using a concentration-response analysis as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the QTc effect of a drug treatment as estimated by exposure-response analysis should be (<10) ms at the highest clinically relevant exposure to conclude that an expanded ECG safety evaluation during later stages of drug development is not needed (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.4 (2.2.4), and Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n4.2.3 Other uses\n\nIn addition to serving as the basis for regulatory decision-making, concentration-response analysis has established its utility in several settings enumerated below.\n\n4.2.4 Providing insight into regimens not studied directly\n\nAn understanding of the concentration-response relationship can help predict the QT effects of doses, dosing regimens, routes of administration, or formulations that were not studied directly. Interpolation within the range of concentrations studied is more reliable than extrapolation above the range.\n\n4.2.5 Predicting OTc effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect pharmacokinetics\n\nUnderstanding the concentration-response relationship can help predict the effects of intrinsic (e.g., cytochrome P450 isoenzyme status) or extrinsic (e.g., drug-drug PK interactions) factors, possibly affecting inclusion criteria or dosing adjustments in later phase studies.\n\n5 Special Cases (6)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that in certain cases, a conventional thorough QT study might not be feasible. In such cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential? (6.1)\n\nIn certain cases, the conventional \"thorough QT/QTc\" study design (a crossover study in healthy volunteers with short-term administration of the usual maximum dose and one higher dose with placebo and positive control) might need to be modified for a drug or active metabolite with a long half-life or delayed QT effect, or because of safety, tolerability, or practical issues that preclude use in healthy subjects. In most cases, alternative designs can be used that may affect power considerations, but do not compromise study interpretation. For example, multiple doses can be studied in a parallel design trial or can use patients with the disease for which the drug is intended rather than healthy volunteers.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere a placebo-controlled comparison using appropriate doses is not possible, alternative study designs should incorporate as many of the usual \"thorough QT/QTc\" design features as possible, and the quality and extent of the preclinical evaluation (ICH S7B guidance) is particularly critical. Other useful supplementary data might include intensive ECG data acquisition in early phase single or multiple ascending dose studies, utilization of concentration-response analysis, and evaluation of exposures that are greater than those anticipated with the intended marketed dose.\n\nA single dose of a positive control is generally sufficient, even if it precedes the investigational drug treatment. In the absence of a positive control, there is reluctance to draw conclusions on the lack of an effect; however, if the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc is less than 10 ms, it is unlikely to have an actual mean effect as large as 20 ms.\n\nWhen a thorough QTc study of usual or modified design is not feasible, the intensity of late phase ECG monitoring will be dependent upon the quality and extent of the nonclinical and clinical evaluation. In situations where it is not possible to study higher exposures than are anticipated with the intended marketed dose, more intensive ECG monitoring might be necessary during phase 3 trials. When the nonclinical and early clinical data do not suggest clinically relevant QTc prolongation, intensive late stage monitoring might not be necessary. Otherwise, monitoring could be conducted as if a thorough QT study had been positive to protect patients in later trials and to obtain information on the frequency of marked QTc prolongation in the patient population (see Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n2.3 The ICH E14 guidance does not address the approach to QT measurement during drug development in the case of combination drug products. Is it recommended that measurement of QT prolongation be performed on drug combinations? (6.2)\n\nIn general, combinations of two or more drugs are unlikely to need a thorough QT/QTc study or intensive late stage monitoring, if the component drugs have been demonstrated to lack relevant effects in thorough QT/QTc studies as described in the ICH E14 guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs Questions and Answers (R3) Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.5194438099861145", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period.

Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The QT/QTc interval data should be presented both as analyses of central tendency (e.g., means, medians) and categorical analyses. Both can provide relevant information on clinical risk assessment.\n\n3.2.1 Analyses of Central Tendency\n\nThe effect of an investigational drug on the QT/QTc interval is most commonly analyzed using the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Additional approaches to the assessment of central tendency could include analysis of changes occurring around the Cmax for each individual. This last analysis would be especially important if the drug has large between-subject variability in the rate of absorption or metabolism.\n\n3.2.2 Categorical Analyses\n\nCategorical analyses of QT/QTc interval data are based on the number and percentage of patients meeting or exceeding some predefined upper limit value. Clinically noteworthy QT/QTc interval changes might be defined in terms of absolute QT/QTc intervals or changes from baseline. Separate analyses should be provided for patients with normal and elevated baseline QT/QTc intervals. As with all QT/QTc interval analyses, categorical analyses are most informative when it is possible to compare the rate of supra-threshold readings in the treatment and control groups.\n\nThere is no consensus concerning the choice of upper limit values for absolute QT/QTc interval and changes from baseline. While lower limits increase the false-positive rate, higher limits increase the risk of failing to detect a signal of concern. In clinical trials, a prolongation of QTc > 500 ms during therapy has been a threshold of particular concern. Multiple analyses using different limits are a reasonable approach to this uncertainty, including:\n\nAbsolute QTc interval prolongation:\n\nQTc interval > 450\n\nQTc interval > 480\n\nQTc interval > 500\n\nChange from baseline in QTc interval:\n\nQTc interval increases from baseline > 30\n\nQTc interval increases from baseline > 60\n\n3.2.3 Analysis of Relationship Between Drug Exposure and QT/QTc Interval Changes\n\nEstablishing the relationship of drug concentrations to changes in QT/QTc interval may provide additional information to assist the planning and interpretation of studies assessing cardiac repolarization. This area is under active investigation.\n\nMorphological Analyses of ECG Waveforms\n\nWhile the predictive value of changes in ECG morphology, such as the development of U waves, has not been established, morphological abnormalities should be described and the data presented in terms of the number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group having changes from baseline that represent the appearance or worsening of the morphological abnormality. Typically these data will be obtained as a part of the 'thorough QT/QTc study'.\n\n4 Adverse Events\n\nIn addition to data on changes in ECG intervals, adverse event data can be another source of information on proarrhythmic potential, including:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.0682568550109863", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: If an investigational drug belongs to a chemical or pharmacological class that has been associated with QT/QTc prolongation, a positive control selected from other members of the same class should be considered to permit a comparison of effect sizes, preferably at equipotent therapeutic doses.\n\nCrossover or parallel group study designs can be suitable for trials assessing the potential of a drug to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation. Crossover studies at least have two potential advantages:\n\nThey usually call for smaller numbers of subjects than parallel group studies, as the subjects serve as their own controls and hence reduce variability of differences related to inter-subject variability;\n\nThey might facilitate heart rate correction approaches based on individual subject data.\n\nParallel group studies might be preferred under certain circumstances:\n\nFor drugs with long elimination half-lives for which lengthy time intervals would be required to achieve steady-state or complete washout;\n\nIf carryover effects are prominent for other reasons, such as irreversible receptor binding or long-lived active metabolites;\n\nIf multiple doses or treatment groups are to be compared.\n\nAn important problem in the measurement of the QT/QTc interval is its intrinsic variability. This variability results from many factors, including activity level, postural changes, circadian patterns, and food ingestion. It is critical to address intrinsic variability in the conduct of the 'thorough QT/QTc study'. This can be accomplished in several ways, including the collection of multiple ECGs at baseline and during the study.\n\n2.2.2 Dose-Effect and Time Course Relationships in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nAn adequate drug development programme should ensure that the dose-response and generally the concentration-response relationship for QT/QTc prolongation have been characterized, including exploration of concentrations that are higher than those achieved following the anticipated therapeutic doses. Data on the drug concentrations around the time of ECG assessment would aid this assessment. If not precluded by considerations of safety or tolerability due to adverse effects, the drug should be tested at substantial multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure. Alternatively, if the concentrations of a drug can be increased by drug-drug or drug-food interactions involving metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2D6) or transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein), these effects could be studied under conditions of maximum inhibition. This approach calls for an understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the parent and significant human metabolites. In general, the duration of dosing or dosing regimen should be sufficient to characterize the effects of the drug and its active metabolites at relevant concentrations.\n\n2.2.3 Timing of ECGs in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1615338325500488"], "In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: The 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7. What information did FDA rely on to make its determinations for the bulk drug substances that are addressed in the final rule?\n\nAs stated in the December 16, 2016 proposed rule, FDA considered information obtained from publicly available sources, including peer-reviewed medical literature. Some of this information was referenced in the nominations, and the remainder FDA gathered through independent searches of medical and pharmaceutical databases. FDA did not review raw data. The nature, quantity, and quality of the information FDA assessed varied considerably from substance to substance. In some cases, there were very little data. For other substances, reports in the literature were more plentiful and sometimes comprised hundreds or thousands of articles. In those cases, generally, the Agency limited its review to a sample of the best literature sources available (e.g., review articles in widely known, peer-reviewed journals; meta-analyses; reports of randomized controlled trials).\n\nQ8. What should I do if I want to use one of the four bulk drug substances that has been identified in the final rule as not being placed on the list to compound a route of administration or dosage form different than what the bulk drug substance was nominated and considered for when it was determined that it would not be placed on the list (e.g., the bulk drug substance was considered in the context of compounding an injectable drug product, but I want to use it to compound a tablet)?\n\nIf you would like to compound a drug product using a bulk drug substance identified as not placed on the list, you may submit a citizen petition under 21 CFR 10.30. The petition should ask FDA to consider revising the rule to include the bulk drug substance. The petition should explain any differences in how you propose to use the bulk drug substance as compared with how it was previously nominated and evaluated for inclusion on the list.\n\nQ9. Does FDA plan to add additional substances to the 503A Bulks List going forward?\n\nMany substances have been nominated for the 503A Bulks List, and FDA has been evaluating them on a rolling basis. FDA intends to publish additional notice and comment rulemaking to address whether these substances should be included on the list.\n\nQ10. Where can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule should be directed to Compounding@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Section 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers; Small Entity Compliance Guide; Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.001612663269043", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: The available evidence of effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of a drug product compounded with the substance, if any such evidence exists\n\nIn evaluating candidates for the 503A bulks list under these criteria, FDA is using a balancing test.

To this end, FDA has been periodically meeting with USP and discussing the list. FDA will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that identifies substances FDA proposes for placement on the 503A bulks list and the substances FDA has evaluated but is not proposing to include on the 503A bulks list. After publication of the NPRM, the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. After considering the comments submitted to the docket, FDA will publish a final rule that establishes the 503A bulks list and identifies the substances that were considered and will not be placed on the list. FDA does not intend to evaluate all of the sufficiently supported nominations before publishing the first NPRM. Instead, after FDA has made a decision on whether to propose a group of substances (e.g., 10 substances) it intends to publish an NPRM with respect to that group of substances and continue to prepare the list on a rolling basis.\n\nA final rule will list the substances that FDA has determined can be used in compounding under section 503A and those substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A bulks list, if any.\n\nAfter a final rule is published, drug products compounded using the substances on the 503A bulks list will be eligible for the section 503A exemptions provided the drug product is compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A. Those substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A bulks list will not qualify for the policies described for the substances in Category 1.\n\n3 Policy21\n\nFootnote 21: See the Appendix for a chart summarizing FDA\u2019s interim policy.\n\nCompounding from Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\nUnder section 503A of the FD&C Act, a bulk drug substance that is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or is not a component of an FDA-approved drug cannot be used in compounding unless it appears on a list promulgated as a regulation pursuant to section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act. This list will be codified at 21 CFR part 216 subpart E.\n\nHowever, until a substance has been evaluated and is identified in a final rule as being included or not included on the 503A bulks list, FDA does not intend to take action against a State-licensed pharmacy, Federal facility, or licensed physician compounding a drug product using a bulk drug substance that is not a component of an FDA-approved drug product and that is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nThe bulk drug substance appears in 503A Category 1 on FDA's website at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Pharmac\n\nYCompounding/UCM467373.pdf. A Category 1 substance may be eligible for inclusion on the 503A bulks list, was nominated with sufficient supporting information for FDA to evaluate it and has not been identified by FDA as a substance that presents a significant safety risk in compounding prior to the publication of a final rule.\n2. The original manufacturer and all subsequent manufacturers of the bulk drug substance are establishments that are registered under section 510 (including foreign establishments that are registered under section 510(i)) of the FD&C Act);\n3. The bulk drug substance is accompanied by a valid COA; and\n4. The drug product compounded using the bulk drug substance is compounded in compliance with all other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nOriginal manufacturer means the entity that originally produced the bulk drug substance and not a subsequent packer, repacker, labeler, or distributor.\n\nThis policy does not apply to a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or a licensed physician, that compounds a drug using a bulk drug substance that does not meet each of the above conditions, and the bulk drug substance is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or a component of an FDA-approved drug.\n\n2 Substances Not Nominated or Nominated Without Adequate Support\n\nAs stated above, one of the categories of bulk drug substances FDA has identified on its website is substances nominated for the 503A bulks list that may be eligible for inclusion on the list, but that FDA is unable to evaluate for inclusion on the list at this time because the substances were nominated with insufficient supporting evidence for FDA to evaluate them (503A Category 3). In the Federal Register of October 27, 2015, FDA established a docket (October docket) where these substances can be re-nominated with sufficient supporting information or where nominations for substances that were not previously nominated can be submitted.\n\nAfter a substance is nominated to the October docket,22 FDA will determine whether the nomination is supported with sufficient information to allow FDA to evaluate it. After FDA makes that determination, the nominated substance will be placed in one of the three categories described in section 2.2 above, and the categorization will be published on the FDA website. Once the category of a substance is published, FDA intends to apply the policy described in Section 3.1 of this guidance to that substance. FDA generally expects to categorize bulk drug substances nominated to the October docket and to publish updated categories on its website on the first business day of each month. Please note that until substances nominated for the October docket have been categorized, the policy does not apply to those substances.\n\nFootnote 22: This includes re-nominations of substances with sufficient supporting information.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you feel that a substance that you nominated does not appear on the appropriate list or category as described in this guidance you can submit your comment to docket number FDA-2015-N-3534. If you have new information on a previously nominated substance that was placed in Category 3, the substance can be re-nominated with the additional information.\n\nA nominator may also submit a comment to the docket requesting withdrawal of any of its nominations. If the party nominating the substance was the sole nominator, FDA will update the categories described in this guidance to reflect the withdrawn nomination.23 FDA intends to provide notice to the public before removing any nominated substances from Category 1 or Category 2.\n\nFootnote 23: If multiple parties nominated the same substance, each party that nominated the substance must withdraw its nomination for the nominated substance to be considered withdrawn and for the categories to be updated to reflect that withdrawal.\n\nWithdrawal of a nomination upon the nominator's request and the resulting updates to the categories described in this guidance, do not reflect a determination by FDA regarding the validity of the nomination or of any reasons given by the nominator for requesting withdrawal. In addition, FDA may continue to evaluate a substance at its discretion even if the nominator submits a comment requesting withdrawal of the nomination.\n\nAppendix: Summary of Policy\n\nThe following table summarizes the interim policy for bulk drug substances set forth in this guidance:\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.906386375427246", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\nFDA seeks to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment while the Agency considers the bulk drug substances that were nominated with sufficient support to permit FDA to evaluate them and promulgates the regulations required under section 503A. Therefore, as described further below, FDA is issuing this interim guidance stating that it does not intend to take regulatory action for compounding drug products under section 503A using a bulk drug substance when an applicable USP or NF monograph for the substance does not exist and the substance is not a component of an FDA-approved product if, among other conditions, FDA has determined that the nomination for the bulk drug substance included adequate information for FDA to evaluate the substance and at this time, the substance does not appear to present significant safety risks.\n\nB. Efforts to Develop the List of Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\n1. Section 503A Bulks List -- Early History\n\nSection 503A was enacted in 1997 as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. In the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A and received nominations for 41 different drug substances. In November 1998, FDA published a guidance for industry, Enforcement Policy During Implementation of Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In this guidance, FDA announced that it would not normally take regulatory action relating to a drug product that had been compounded with a bulk drug substance that had been nominated for inclusion on the bulk drug substances list on or before November 21, 1999, while the substance was being evaluated, as long as the compounding complied with the other effective requirements in section 503A and did not appear to present a significant safety risk.11\n\nFootnote 11: The 1998 guidance was withdrawn in the Federal Register notice announcing the availability of the draft guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. See 78 FR 72901 (Dec. 4, 2013). The final guidance was published in July 2014.\n\nIn January 1999, after evaluating the nominated drug substances and consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) as required by section 503A, FDA published a proposed rule listing 20 drug substances on the section 503A bulks list (64 FR 996, January 7, 1999). The preamble to the proposed rule indicated that 10 of the 41 nominated substances were the subject of a USP or NF monograph, or components of FDA approved drugs and did not need to be considered for inclusion on the list.12 The proposed rule also described 10 nominated substances that were still under consideration for the bulk drug substances list and stated that one of the substances was withdrawn by its nominator at the first meeting of the PCAC. The PCAC reconvened in May 1999 to discuss bulk drug substances included in the proposed rule, in addition to other bulk drug substances (64 FR 19791; April 22, 1999).\n\nHowever, after a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that certain provisions of section 503A were unconstitutional,13 FDA suspended its efforts to develop the bulk drugs list under section 503A.\n\nFootnote 13: For additional legal history of section 503A, see the guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and cosmetic Act.\n\nBecause of the amount of time that had passed between the publication of the proposed rule and the enactment of the 2013 Drug Quality and Security Act, which removed the provisions of the FD&C Act that the U.S. Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional in 2002, FDA felt it was necessary to begin again to develop the section 503A bulk drug substance list. In the December 4, 2013, Federal Register (78 FR 72841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.2.2 Current Nominations for the 503A Bulks List\n\nIn response to the December 2013, Federal Register notice, over 2,000 substances were nominated for the 503A bulks list. However, many of the substances nominated for the 503A list were for substances that can be compounded without being on the list because they are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or are a component of an FDA-approved drug. In addition, many of the nominations were not for substances used in compounding as active ingredients, or did not include sufficient information for FDA to evaluate the nominated substances for inclusion on the list. To improve the efficiency of the process for developing the 503A bulks list, FDA reopened the nomination process in July 2014 (79 FR 37742) and provided more detailed information on what it needs to evaluate nominations for the 503A bulks list. FDA stated that bulk drug substances that were previously nominated would not be considered further unless they were re-nominated with adequate support to permit a meaningful evaluation. Substances that were already eligible for use in compounding or that were not adequately supported would not be evaluated for placement on the 503A bulks list.\n\nIn response to this request for nominations, approximately 740 unique substances were nominated. Of the nominated substances:\n\nApproximately 315 substances are already eligible for use in compounding under section 503A.\n\nThese are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or components of an FDA-approved drug product, which can be used in compounding pursuant to sections 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) and (II) and, therefore, can be compounded without being included on the 503A bulks list. To determine if a bulk drug substance is the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, see the USP-NF available at www.USPNF.com. To determine if a bulk drug substance is a component of an FDA approved drug, see the FDA's Orange Book:_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, available at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm.\n\nAt least one14 of the nominated substances is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nFootnote 14: The over-the-counter finished drug product Maalox was nominated. Maalox is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nThis is a finished drug product that was nominated by its brand name. Finished drug products are not eligible for the 503A bulks list because they do not meet the definition of a bulk drug substance in 21 CFR 207.3.\n\nAt least one of the substances is considered a biological product subject to approval in a biologics license application (BLA) under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act when used for the indication proposed in the nomination.\n\nThis substance is not eligible for the 503A bulks list because biological products subject to approval in a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act are not eligible for the exemptions in section 503A of the FD&C Act.15 No biological products subject to approval in a BLA will be considered for the 503A bulks list.\n\nFootnote 15: The nominated substance is sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate. See the revised draft guidance, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Products Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics License Application for FDA\u2019s proposed policies regarding State-licensed pharmacies, Federal facilities, and outsourcing facilities that mix, dilute, or repackage biological products outside the scope of an approved BLA.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.972378730773926", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: 2 Provisions of Section 503A That Require Regulations or Other FDA Actions\n\nSpecific provisions of section 503A of the FD&C Act require rulemaking or other action by FDA. FDA's policy related to these specific provisions is described below.\n\n2.1.1 Withdrawn or Removed List\n\nFDA promulgated a final rule, codified at 21 CFR 216.24, which lists drug products that cannot be compounded because they have been withdrawn or removed from the market because the drug products or components of the drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective. FDA intends to update this list periodically, and expects compounds to comply with the list as it currently exists and with any final updates.\n\n2.2.2 Bulk Drug Substances List\n\nSection 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act provides that a drug product can be compounded using bulk drug substances that do not have an applicable USP or NF monograph (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) of the FD&C Act) and are not components of FDA-approved drugs (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act) if the bulk drug substances appear on a list developed by FDA and issued through regulation.\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17,011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list. In the Federal Register of January 7, 1999 (64 FR 996), FDA published a proposed rule listing bulk drug substances that can be used in pharmacy compounding. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act. FDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\n2.3.3 \"Demonstrable Difficulties\" for Compounding\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act, a compounded drug product would not qualify for the exemptions provided in subsection (a) if it is identified by FDA through regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,840), FDA published a notice inviting all interested persons to nominate drug products or categories of drug products for inclusion on a list of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding (difficult-to-compound list). This provision is not enforceable until FDA promulgates an implementing regulation.\n\niii.1.4 Memorandum of Understanding Between FDA and the States\n\nSection 503A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act states that FDA, in consultation with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) will develop a standard MOU for use between FDA and the states that will address the interstate distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products and provide for appropriate investigation by a state agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside that state. On January 21, 1999, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of a draft standard MOU, developed in consultation with the NABP. This draft MOU was not finalized. FDA intends to publish a new draft MOU for comment that will replace the January 1999 draft.\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(B)(ii), an individual or firm in a state that does not enter into an MOU with FDA that distributes, or causes to be distributed, compounded drug products out of the state in which they are compounded, can compound for interstate distribution outside the state only 5% of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the individual or firm. FDA does not intend to enforce the 5% limit on interstate distribution until after FDA has finalized an MOU and made it available to the states for their consideration and signature. The Federal Register notice that will announce the availability of the draft MOU will specify a time period during which the MOU will be made available to the states to sign. After this time period expires, FDA intends to begin enforcing the 5% limit in states that have not signed the MOU.\n\nIV Guidance on Regulatory Action\n\nRequirements Applicable to Drug Products that Meet the Conditions of Section 503a\n\nAs stated above, a compounded drug product intended for use in humans that meets the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act and its associated regulations is exempt from the requirements under sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.\n\nHowever, individuals and firms may be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of other requirements of the FD&C Act. Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe drug product must not consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health. (Sections 501(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, its strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, the standards set forth in the compendium, unless the difference is plainly stated on its label. (Section 501(b) of the FD&C Act)3. For a drug product not subject to section 501(b) of the FD&C Act, the drug's strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, that which it purports to have. (Section 501(c) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, it must be packaged and labeled as prescribed in the compendium. (Section 502(g) of the FD&C Act)\n\nThe drug product's labeling, advertising, and promotion must not be false or misleading. (Sections 502(a), 502(bb),10 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act)\n\nFootnote 10: Section 502(bb) was added to the FD&C Act by section 103(b) of the DQSA.\n\n2 Enforcement Action When a Drug Does Not Meet the Conditions of Section 503A\n\nIf FDA determines that an individual or firm compounds a drug product that does not meet the conditions of section 503A, then in addition to the violations listed above in section IV.A., the individual or firm that compounds the drug product may also be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.11 Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFootnote 11: See Medical Ctr. Pharm. v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 383, 405 (5th Cir. 2008) (\u201ccompounded drugs are in fact \u2018new drugs\u2019 as defined by [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 321(p) but are exempt from the requirements of [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1), and 355 if and only if they comply with the conditions set forth in [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 353a.\u201d).\n\n2.2.1 Producing Adulterated Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR parts 210 and 211, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of a drug must conform with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to CGMP requirements.\n\n2.2 Producing Unapproved New Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm must not introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug unless an approved NDA or ANDA is in effect for that drug product. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the new drug approval requirements.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 201.5, drug products that are not labeled with adequate directions for use are misbranded. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the requirements for adequate directions for use.\n\nIn addition to sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm that compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act would be subject to the requirements listed in section IV.A, above, as well as other requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nEnforcement Approach\n\nGenerally, FDA expects to employ a risk-based enforcement approach with respect to violative compounded drugs, giving the highest enforcement priority to compounded drugs and violations of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations that pose the greatest public health risks. However, FDA emphasizes that it need not identify a particular safety problem before pursuing enforcement action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.113295078277588", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Section 503A Bulks List\n\nFinal Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nMay 2019\n\nCompoundingSection 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4th Floor Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 Phone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353 Email: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nMay 2019\n\nCompounding\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nSection 503A Bulks List Final Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Regulatory Policy and the Office of Unapproved Drug Labeling Compliance in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing the list of bulk drug substances2 that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 353a) (final rule or 503A Bulks List Final Rule). On February 19, 2019 (84 FR 4696), FDA published a final rule that establishes FDA's criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that may be used to compound drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act (the 503A Bulks List or the list) and that places six substances on the list. The final rule, entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" also identifies four substances that were considered for and not included on the list.\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is evaluating bulk drug substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List on a rolling basis and intends to address additional substances in future rulemaking.\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. FDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)3 to assist small businesses in complying with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 3: 5 U.S.C. 601.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions under which a compounded drug product qualifies for exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act related to FDA approval prior to marketing, current good manufacturing practice requirements, and labeling with adequate directions for use. One of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility or a licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that (1) comply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by FDA; or (3) if such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by FDA, appear on a list of bulk drug substances developed by FDA through regulation.4\n\nFootnote 4: See section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a(b)(1)(A)(i)).\n\nAs noted above, the 503A Bulks List Final Rule establishes criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the 503A Bulks List, identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list, and identifies four other bulk drug substances that were considered and are not being included on the 503A Bulks List.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule addresses only 10 of the substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List. The final rule identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list: Brilliant Blue G, also known as Coomassiee Brilliant Blue G-250; cantharidin (for topical use only); diphenylcyclopropone (for topical use only); N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) (for topical use only); squaric acid dibutyl ester (for topical use only); and thymol iodide (for topical use only). The final rule also identifies four other bulk drug substances that are not being included on the list: oxitriptan, piracetam, silver protein mild, and tranilast.\n\nAlthough only the 10 substances listed above are specifically addressed in the final rule, the criteria for evaluation identified in the final rule will be applied to all bulk drug substances that are considered for the 503A Bulks List.\n\nCan substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n\nNo. As stated above, section 503A provides compounded drug products with exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act, including premarket approval, but only when those compounded drug products meet the conditions of section 503A. A compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that are not being placed on the list would not meet those conditions and therefore would not qualify for the exemptions from the FD&C Act.\n\nIn addition, as described in the Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry,5 substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A Bulks List no longer qualify for the interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances.\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, be sure to check the Agency\u2019s guidance website at http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDABasicsforIndustry/ucm234622.htm.\n\nQ3. What should I do if I am a pharmacist and I receive a prescription for a compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that is not being placed on the 503A Bulks List as part of this final rule?\n\nA drug product compounded using a bulk drug substance that is identified in a final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List does not qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act. Compounding with any of the four substances identified in the 503A Bulks List Final Rule, or with substances identified in any other final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List, may subject the compounder to regulatory action.\n\nQ4. When and how do compounders have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction and scope\n\nThis guidance sets forth the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or Agency) interim regulatory policy concerning compounding using bulk drug substances under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or Act). Section 503A of the FD&C Act includes certain restrictions on the bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding and directs FDA to develop a list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under that section. FDA is developing this list of bulk drug substances (the 503A bulks list), and this guidance describes FDA's interim regulatory policy for licensed pharmacists in State-licensed pharmacies and Federal facilities and for licensed physicians that compound human drug products using bulk drug substances while the list is being developed.2,3\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not apply to drugs compounded from bulk drug substances for use in animals. For proposed policies pertaining to compounding drug products from bulk drug substances for use in animals, see FDA\u2019s draft guidance, Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances.\n\nAll FDA guidances are available on the FDA guidance web page. FDA updates guidances regularly. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, always consult the guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformationGuidances/default.htm.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nCompounding From Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Act\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be satisfied for human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or by a licensed physician, to be exempt from the following three sections of the FD&C Act: section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug applications or abbreviated new drug applications); section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning current good manufacturing practice requirements).\n\nOne of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that:\n\nComply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary (NF) monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding;\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by the Secretary; or\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by the Secretary, appears on a list developed by the Secretary through regulations issued by the Secretary under subsection (c) of section 503A.4 Footnote 4: See Section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nA bulk drug substance is defined as meaning \"the same as active pharmaceutical ingredient as defined in 21 CFR 207.1(b).\" See 21 CFR 207.3. Active pharmaceutical ingredient is defined as \"any substance that is intended for incorporation into a finished drug product and is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body,\" but the term \"does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of the substance\" (see section 503A(b)(1)(A) and 21 CFR 207.3).5({}^{,})6 FDA has interpreted \"an applicable USP or NFmonograph\" to mean an official USP or NF drug substance monograph. Accordingly, FDA does not consider USP monographs for dietary supplements to be \"applicable\" USP or NF monographs within the meaning of section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I).\n\nUnder section 503A(c)(1), before developing this list through regulation, FDA must convene and consult an advisory committee on compounding unless FDA determines that the issuance of such regulation before consultation with the advisory committee is necessary to protect the public health. FDA must also consult with USP when promulgating the regulations.7 The criteria for determining which bulk drug substances should appear on the section 503A bulks list \"shall include historical use, reports in peer reviewed medical literature, or other criteria the Secretary may identify.\"8\n\nFootnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1836352348327637"], "As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8425827026367188", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA will evaluate the information on the changes made to the device and the rationale for the changes, as well as the information the applicant submits from published and unpublished reports, and literature to determine if any of this information demonstrates that the safety and effectiveness profile of the device has changed. FDA can then determine whether any action (e.g., a labeling change) is necessary to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device.\n\nVI FDA's Recommendations\n\nGenerally, FDA's review will result in one of the following recommendations:\n\nAcknowledgement of Review of Annual Report\n\nWhen FDA reviews the annual report and has no further questions, we will issue a letter or send an e-mail to inform the applicant of this status and indicate that no additional information is needed.\n\nRequest Additional Information\n\nIf the applicant has not provided all the information required for an annual report, or FDA finds that the information provided is not sufficient to allow a complete review, we will request additional information by letter or email. If FDA needs only clarification of an issue, we will work interactively with the applicant via telephone or e-mail, whichever FDA believes will be the most efficient.\n\nChanges Not Appropriate for an Annual Report\n\nIf FDA determines that a change made to the device required a PMA Supplement or 30- DayNotice under 21 CFR 814.39, and one was not submitted, we will notify the applicant by letter or email.4 In general, FDA will issue a letter notifying the applicant that a PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice is required for the change and request that the appropriate submission be provided within a specified timeframe. However, there may also be instances when OC review is necessary to determine if any additional regulatory actions are warranted.\n\nFootnote 4: See the guidance, \u201cProcedures for Handling Post-Approval Studies Imposed by PMA Order,\u201d\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/procedures-handling-post-approval-studies-imposed-pma-order.\n\nVII.Other Reports - Post-Approval Study Reports\n\nAs described in 21 CFR 814.82(a)(2), FDA may require continuing evaluation (post-approval studies) and periodic reporting on the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of the device for its intended use (post-approval study reports). If your approval order identifies post-approval studies you must conduct, the order will describe the purpose of the studies and how frequently you must submit post-approval study reports.\n\nPlease submit your annual report and post-approval study report separately, even if they are due at the same time, and identify the date that you submitted your post-approval study report in your annual report. This will facilitate FDA's review because the post-approval study report and the annual report are typically reviewed for different purposes.5\n--------------------\nContext title: Annual Reports for Approved Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.004372596740723", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: 5.2.4 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA list of all individuals, with their titles and affiliations, who will participate in the requested meeting from the applicant's organization, including consultants and interpreters.69 Footnote 69: The applicant should notify their FDA POC immediately if the list of meeting participants from the applicant\u2019s organization and consultants changes. In this situation, FDA may reschedule the meeting if the revised list of meeting participants requires additional FDA personnel.

FDA has discretion to determine which assessment disciplines attend the teleconference. FDA will have appropriate staff participate in the teleconference to respond to the applicant's questions, which may be from different disciplines than the disciplines that the applicant requested to participate.\n\n5.2.5 EMCRMs\n\nFor EMCRMs, in addition to the information in subsection 1 - General Meeting Package Content, meeting packages should generally also include:\n\nIf applicable, the specific deficiency(ies) that the applicant is requesting the rationale for and/or the questions related to FDA's assessment of the data or information in the ANDA.\n\nQuestions related to a proposed scientific path to address possible deficiencies identified in the mid-cycle DRL(s) and any questions about potential new data or information to address possible deficiencies identified in the mid-cycle DRL(s).73 Footnote 73: As stated in section III.B of this guidance, FDA will not provide substantive assessment of the data or information provided by the applicant at the meeting.\n\nThe requested format74 -- face-to-face, video conference, teleconference, or written response only. For requested formats other than written response only, the meeting request package should also include the following information: Footnote 74: For applicants that meet the criteria in the GDUFA III commitment letter for an EMCRM, FDA will generally grant the applicant\u2019s requested meeting format. If FDA, in its discretion, provides the opportunity for an EMCRM to an ANDA applicant that does not meet the criteria in the GDUFA III commitment letter, FDA has the discretion to provide a teleconference or written response only instead of a meeting.\n\nA proposed agenda outlining how the 60-minute time frame allotted for the EMCRM should be apportioned for discussing each agenda item.\n\n5.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSuggested dates and times (e.g., morning or afternoon) for the meeting that are within the time frame of an EMCRM. Nonavailability dates and times should also be included.\n\nA list of all individuals, with their titles and affiliations, who will participate in the requested meeting from the applicant's organization, including consultants and interpreters.75 Footnote 75: The applicant should notify their FDA POC immediately if the list of meeting participants from the applicant\u2019s organization and consultants changes. In this situation, FDA may reschedule the meeting if the revised list of meeting participants requires additional FDA personnel. In the event this meeting is ultimately rescheduled outside the 90-day window, FDA will consider the GDUFA III goal of conducting the meeting within 90 days after issuance of the last mid-cycle DRL met.\n\nA list of specific assessment disciplines asked to participate in the requested meeting or teleconference based on the questions to be discussed. FDA has discretion to determine which assessment disciplines attend the meeting. FDA will have appropriate staff participate in the meeting or teleconference to respond to the applicant's questions, which may be from different disciplines than the disciplines that the applicant requested to participate.\n\n5.2.3 Post-CRL Scientific Meetings\n\nFor post-CRL scientific meetings, in addition to the information in subsection 1 - General Meeting Package Content, meeting packages should generally also include:\n\nA brief statement indicating how the product meets the criteria for a complex product (see section II).\n\nThe specific approaches to address deficiencies identified in the CRL, grouped by discipline, with data to support discussion. The meeting package must discuss one or more of the following: (1) a new equivalence study needed to address the deficiencies identified in the CRL; (2) an approach that is different from that submitted in the ANDA, e.g., a change in study type from in vivo to in vitro; (3) a new comparative use human factors study; or (4) a new approach to demonstrating sameness of a complex active ingredient.\n\nThe requested format76 - face-to-face, videoconference, teleconference, or written response only. For requested formats other than written response only, the meeting request package should also include the following information:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA proposed agenda and discussion topics, outlining how the 60-minute time frame allotted for the post-CRL scientific meeting should be apportioned for discussing each agenda item.\n\nSuggested dates and times (e.g., morning or afternoon) for the meeting that are within the time frame for a post-CRL scientific meeting.

In this situation, FDA may reschedule the meeting if the revised list of meeting participants requires additional FDA personnel. In the event this meeting is ultimately scheduled outside the 90-day window, FDA will consider the GDUFA III goal of conducting the meeting within 90 days of granting the meeting request met.\n\nA list of all individuals, with their titles and affiliations, who will participate in the requested meeting from the applicant's organization, including consultants and interpreters.77 Footnote 78: GDUFA III commitment letter at 26.\n--------------------\nContext title: Formal Meetings Between FDA and ANDA Applicants of Complex Products Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.054288387298584", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Under 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v), an applicant may submit one or more protocols (i.e., comparability protocols) describing tests, studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the absence of an adverse effect from specified types of changes. A comparability protocol can be used to reduce the reporting category for specified changes. A proposed comparability protocol must be submitted as a prior approval supplement, if not approved as part of the original application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v)). On February 25, 2003, FDA issued a draft guidance on comparability protocols entitled Comparability protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\n4 General Requirements\n\nOther than for editorial changes in previously submitted information (e.g., correction of spelling or typographical errors, reformatting of batch records), an applicant must notify FDA about each change in each condition established in an approved application beyond the variations already provided for in the application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nA supplement or annual report must include a list of all changes contained in the supplement or annual report (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). On the list, FDA recommends that the applicant describe each change in enough detail to allow FDA to quickly determine whether the appropriate reporting category has been used. For supplements, this list must be provided in the cover letter (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). In annual reports, the list should be included in the summary section. The supplement or annual report also is required to describe the change fully (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nAn applicant making a change to an approved application under section 506A of the Act also must conform to other applicable laws and regulations, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Act (21 U.S.C. SS 351(a)(2)(B)) and applicable regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226, and 514). For example, manufacturers must comply with relevant CGMP validation and recordkeeping requirements (21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226) and ensure that relevant records are readily available for examination by authorized FDA personnel during an inspection.\n\nAn applicant must include a statement in each supplement and amendment to a supplement certifying that a field copy has been provided to the appropriate FDA district office (21 CFR514.8(b)(1)(iv)).3\n\nFootnote 3: For a change to a product manufactured in a foreign facility, a field copy of the supplement or its amendment is not required to be submitted to an FDA district office. However, FDA recommends that the applicant state that the drug made with the change is manufactured only at a foreign site.\n\n4 Assessing the effect of manufacturing changes\n\nAssessment of the Effects of the Change\n\nThe holder of an approved application under section 512 of the Act must assess the effects of the change before distributing a drug made with a manufacturing change (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii)).4 For each change, the supplement or annual report must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change (section 506A(b), (c)(1), (d)(2)(A), and (d)(3)(A) of the Act). The type of information that must be included in a supplemental application or annual report is specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(iv), (b)(3)(vi), and (b)(4)(iii).\n\nFootnote 4: Assess the effects of the change means to evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(i)). The term assess or assessment as used in this guidance are not the same as validation. Certain validation information, such as sterilization processes, is considered information that is needed to assess the effect of the change as specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii) and should be submitted in an NADA or ANADA. Unless otherwise specified by FDA, other validation (e.g., process, equipment) data need not be submitted in the application, but must be retained at the facility and be available for review by FDA (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180).\n\nConformance to Specifications\n\nAn assessment of the effects of a change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug should include a determination that the drug substance intermediates, drug substance, in-process materials, and/or drug product affected by the change conform to the approved specifications.5 A specification is a quality standard (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drugs including, for example, drug substances, Type A medicated articles, drug products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Acceptance criteria are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Conformance to a specification means that the material, when tested according to the analytical procedures listed in the specification, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.\n\nFootnote 5: If a specification needs to be revised as a result of the change, this would be considered a multiple change (see sections VIII and XI).\n\n3 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nIn addition to confirming that the material affected by manufacturing changes continues to meet its specification, the applicant should perform additional testing, when appropriate, to assess whether the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug have been or will be affected. The assessment should include, as appropriate, evaluation of any changes in the chemical, physical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and/or stability profiles. This additional assessment could involve testing of the post-change drug itself or, if appropriate, the material directly affected by the change. The type of additional testing that an applicant should perform would depend on the type of manufacturing change, the type of drug, and the effect of the change on the quality of the drug. For example:\n\nEvaluation of changes in the impurity or degradant profile could first involve profiling using appropriate chromatographic techniques and then, depending on the observed changes in the impurity profile, toxicology tests to qualify a new impurity or degradant or to qualify an impurity that is above a previously qualified level.6 Footnote 6: Recommendations on identifying, qualifying, and reporting impurities can be found in relevant guidances (e.g., VICH GL10(R), Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances (Revision), Draft Revised Guidance, (GFI 92) (January 6, 2006)).\n\nEvaluation of the hardness or friability of a tablet after certain changes.\n\nAssessment of the effect of a change on bioequivalence could include, for example, multipoint and/or multimedia dissolution profiling and/or an in vivo bioequivalence study.\n\nEvaluation of extractables from new packaging components or moisture permeability of a new container closure system.\n\nAn applicant should refer to all relevant FDA guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change. If guidance for information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, CVM's Division of Manufacturing Technologies, HFV-140, should be consulted.\n\nEquivalence\n\nWhen testing is performed, the applicant should assess the extent to which the manufacturing change has affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug product. Typically, this is accomplished by comparing test results from pre- andpost-change material and determining if the test results are equivalent. Simply stated: Is the drug made after the change equivalent to the drug made before the change? Equivalence comparisons frequently have a criterion for comparison with calculation of confidence intervals relative to a predetermined equivalence interval. For this, as well as for other reasons, equivalent does not necessarily mean identical. Equivalence also may relate to maintenance of a quality characteristic (e.g., stability) rather than a single performance of a test.\n\nAdverse Effect\n\nSome manufacturing changes have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug. In many cases, the applicant chooses not to implement these manufacturing changes, but sometimes the applicant wishes to do so. If an assessment indicates that a change has adversely affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug, FDA recommends that the change be submitted in a prior approval supplement, regardless of the recommended reporting category for the change. For example, a process change recommended for a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement could cause the formation of a new degradant that requires qualification and/or identification. The applicant's degradation qualification procedures may indicate that there are no safety concerns relating to the new degradant. Even so, the applicant should submit this change in a prior approval supplement with appropriate information to support the continued safety and effectiveness of the drug. During the review of the prior approval supplement, FDA will assess the impact of any adverse effect on the drug as this change may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #83 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Changes to Approved NADA:ANADA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.2098188400268555", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: 7 Applicant's Role in the Interactive Review Process\n\nWhat the Applicant Can Do to Help Ensure an Efficient Interactive Review Process\n\nTo help ensure that the Interactive Review process is effective, the applicant should do the following:\n\n[noitemsep,parsep=0pt]\n\nPhone calls should be used primarily for requests for clarification that the FDA reviewer can easily document (e.g., the location of specific information within the submission, interpretation of a graph).\n\n[noitemsep,parsep=0pt]\n\nResponses to Deficiencies Requested via the Interactive Review Process\n\nFDA should accept email responses to the information requested via the Interactive Review process and include that information as part of the official administrative file for the submission. FDA should not request that the applicant also formally submit these Interactive Review responses to the appropriate Document Control Center (DCC) as part of an official submission.\n\nPlease note that eCopy requirements do not apply to information obtained during the Interactive Review process (via email, phone, and/or fax) once a submission is under review, if that information is not submitted to CDRH's or CBER's DCC.However, should an applicant choose to submit a response to an Interactive Review request to CDRH's or CBER's DCC [which should only occur if the size of the response makes communication by email (no individual email should exceed 50MB) or fax infeasible], it will be logged in as an amendment and be subject to the eCopy requirements [31].\n\n8 Applicant's Role in the Interactive Review Process\n\nWhat the Applicant Can Do to Help Ensure an Efficient Interactive Review Process\n\nTo help ensure that the Interactive Review process is effective, the applicant should do the following:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n* submit a well organized and administratively and scientifically complete submission consistent with applicable regulations, recommendations in the available guidance documents, and communications with FDA prior to submission;\n* include complete contact information in the cover letter (i.e., name, email, phone number, fax number) in the company cover letter for each submission. FDA also recommends providing alternative contact information in case the lead contact is not available. In addition, foreign applicants should have a U.S. representative32 available to participate in the Interactive Review process and to provide a means to contact the foreign company as quickly as possible; Footnote 32: If a PMA applicant does not reside or have a place of business within the U.S., the PMA must be countersigned by an authorized representative residing or maintaining a place of business in the U.S. and must identify the representative\u2019s name and address (21 CFR 814.20(a)). Identification of and contact information for a U.S. agent is required for all foreign device manufacturers when they register and list with FDA (21 CFR 607.40(d) and 21 CFR 807.40(b)). To facilitate timely communication, it is recommended that a U.S. representative be included for all submission types, in addition to PMAs.\n* apply appropriate material or testing standard(s) and submit the necessary declarations or data to support the use of the standard(s); and Footnote 33: The examples are specific to the Interactive Review process when the submission is under review.\n* provide a complete response to all deficiencies communicated via Interactive Review within the FDA-allotted timeframe\n* Examples of When the Applicant Should Contact the Lead Reviewer [CDRH] or Regulatory Project Manager [CBER] Examples of when the applicant should contact the lead reviewer or Regulatory Project Manager (RPM) of the submission include the following:33 Footnote 33: The examples are specific to the Interactive Review process when the submission is under review.\n* to reconcile any disagreement with a deficiency cited by the lead reviewer or consulting reviewer during Interactive Review;\n* to inquire whether a revised Interactive Review timeframe may be given to address a deficiency because the initial timeframe cannot be met (this does not pertain to our last Interactive Review communication at the end of the review cycle, which we intend to limit to 7 calendar days);\n* to discuss procedural questions related to the submission;\n* to correct errors in the data submitted;\n* to clarify information in the submission that the applicant subsequently notices is unclear; and\n* to alert FDA that it intends to submit new, unsolicited information or data (depending on its extent, the information/data may necessitate a new submission or be logged in as an amendment to an existing submission).\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants should refrain from using Interactive Review to request status updates as such requests may interfere with FDA's ability to meet applicable timeframes.\n\n2.3 FDA Review Team Considerations\n\nFDA consulting reviewers, like the lead reviewer, should participate in the Interactive Review of submissions. However, the lead reviewer/RPM should determine whether or not a consulting reviewer should communicate directly with the applicant or communicate to the applicant through the lead reviewer/RPM to resolve minor deficiencies.\n\nIn cases where a consulting reviewer communicates directly with the applicant on a particular deficiency, a documented record of the exchange should be made available to the lead reviewer/RPM (e.g., \"cc\" on an email). The consulting reviewer is also expected to document any interaction as part of his/her review record back to the lead reviewer/RPM.\n\n3.3 Missed MDUFA Decision Communication\n\n3.4 Purpose of Missed MDUFA Decision Communication\n\nThe purpose of this communication is to facilitate a timely resolution to any outstanding issues that have precluded FDA from reaching a MDUFA decision prior to the appropriate MDUFA decision goal.\n\n3.5 Timing of Missed MDUFA Decision Communication\n\nA Missed MDUFA Decision communication should occur for those submissions that have not reached a MDUFA decision by:\n\n100 FDA days for 510(k)s; and\n\n20 FDA days after the applicable FDA day goal for Original PMAs and Panel-Track PMA Supplements.\n\n3.6 Content of Missed MDUFA Decision Communication\n\nFDA intends to provide written (e.g., email) feedback to be discussed in a meeting or teleconference. The feedback should reflect appropriate management input and approval and should include:\n\nall outstanding issues with the application preventing FDA from reaching a decision;34 Footnote 34: Note that \u201cissues\u201d in this context refers to the major outstanding review topic areas or other reasons that are preventing FDA from reaching a MDUFA decision and not necessarily to individual deficiencies. Any specific outstanding deficiencies that preclude approval should not be included in this communication, but should be communicated informally through Interactive Review or formally in a MDUFA decision letter.\n\naction items for FDA and/or the applicant;\n\nthe estimated completion date for the action items identified for each party; and* proposed dates for meetings from which the applicant may choose (the applicant may, in turn, propose alternative dates to FDA).\n\nOutstanding issues should be resolved through Interactive Review whenever possible. If all of the outstanding issues are adequately presented through the written correspondence, FDA and the applicant can agree that a meeting or teleconference is not necessary.\n--------------------\nContext title: Types of Communication During the Review of Medical Device Submissions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.494818210601807", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: A clear statement of the issue in dispute and a discussion of why the relief sought by the submitter should be granted.\n\nThe executive summary should conclude with an explicit statement of the relief or action being requested; e.g., overturn of a 510(k) NSE determination or a PMA Not-Approvable letter. If there is an acceptable alternative to a complete reversal of the decision being challenged, such as deletion of certain deficiencies and referral of the matter back to the review team for reconsideration under specific conditions, that alternative should be stated in the conclusion. As stated earlier, the review must be based only on the information already in the administrative file at the time of the decision that is the subject of the review.\n\n3.3 Review Conclusion\n\nThe review process is concluded with the issuance of a decision letter. The letter describes the basis for the request for review, conveys the decision of the review authority, and explains the basis for the decision. Review decision letters commonly contain recommendations for further actions to resolve the matter(s) in dispute and typically describe options for further review or appeal, should the submitter be dissatisfied with the outcome. If the person requesting an appeal of a 517A decision is granted an in-person meeting or teleconference under section 517A of the FD&C Act, then a decision must be rendered within 30 days of the meeting or teleconference; otherwise, a decision must be rendered within 45 days of the request for appeal. However, if the matter has been referred to experts outside of the FDA as described in Section 2.4, section 517A of the FD&C Act does not specify a timeframe for rendering a decision. While there is no statutory or regulatory obligation to do so, the Center does strive to meet the same timeframes for non-517A decisions, as resources permit.\n\n3.4 The Medical Devices Dispute Resolution Panel\n\n3.4.1 Background\n\nThe Medical Devices Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) is intended to provide a means for independent review of a scientific controversy or dispute between a stakeholder and FDA. The DRP operates under the provisions of FDA's Medical Devices Advisory Committee Charter and the processes that apply to Medical Devices Advisory Committees generally apply to the DRP except as described in this document. The DRP fulfills two statutory mandates under the FD&C Act: The requirement of section 515(g)(2)(B) for review of PMA approvals and denials by an advisory committee, \"which may not be panels under section 513;\" and the requirement of section 562 for a process for review of scientific controversiesby a sponsor, applicant, or manufacturer of a drug or device product for which no other section of the FD&C Act \"provides a right of review of the matter in controversy....\" Under section 562 of the FD&C Act, CDRH may convene a meeting of the DRP to provide advice to the Center:\n\nAs directed by the Center Director to provide advice on a scientific controversy or a matter in dispute that has come to the attention of the Center Director; or\n\nUpon approval of a request by a stakeholder as part of an appeal to the Center level.\n\nThis section describes the processes that apply to requests for meetings of the DRP (apart from requests under section 515(g)(2) of the FD&C Act, which are described in section 4.1 of this document) and general DRP considerations.\n\nAppendix B Panel Composition\n\nPursuant to the charter of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, the DRP has five standing members, who are generally appointed for four-year terms, and three temporary members, as follows:\n\nThree standing voting members, including the Panel Chair, who are chosen for their general scientific expertise applicable to a wide range of issues;\n\nA non-voting member representing consumer interests;\n\nA non-voting member representing industry interests;\n\nA minimum of three temporary voting members who are chosen for their specific expertise and experience in the matter under consideration by the DRP.\n\nAlthough each DRP meeting will include at a minimum the eight members described above, additional temporary voting or non-voting members may be included on each Panel roster to provide specific expertise as needed. Temporary panel members, including consultants, may be drawn from members of other Advisory Panels or may be Special Government Employees or other qualified consultants. Temporary panel members are typically selected specifically for expertise appropriate to each DRP meeting. Individuals who previously had substantial involvement in the matter under review, such as participation on a relevant Advisory Panel, are not eligible. Although interested parties will be apprised of the selections prior to the DRP meeting, the individuals are chosen by FDA to ensure freedom from bias or conflicts and to ensure that appropriate expertise is represented on the DRP. Concerns regarding the individuals selected as temporary voting members can be expressed in writing to the Ohbudsman, who will investigate these concerns and note them in the administrative record of the DRP proceedings.\n\nC Filing a Request\n\nAn interested party who wishes to submit a request for review to the Center level may request that the DRP be convened to consider the dispute and make a recommendation to the Center Director. As with a request for a review authority to convene an Advisory Panel, a request to convene the DRP should be made within the context of a request for review at the Center level under 21 CFR 10.75.10 A review request that includes a request to convene the DRP should be submitted within 30 days of the date of the action for 517A decisions and within 60 days for non-517A decisions. The format of this request can follow the guidelines described in Section 2.5 of this document and should include an explanation of the basis for the request. The Deputy Center Director, in consultation with the Ombudsman, will decide whether to grant the request and will convey the decision to the submitter, normally within 15 days of receipt of the request. If the request is denied, then the 21 CFR 10.75 review process will go forward as described in Section 2 of this document, but without the involvement of the DRP.\n\nFootnote 10: A request to convene a meeting of the DRP may also be part of a petition under 21 CFR 10.33, as described in Section 4.3 of this document.\n\nAppendix D Eligibility Review\n\nA request to convene the DRP should meet the following criteria:\n\nThe submitter should have exhausted other review options through the supervisory chain below the Center level; for instance, a 21 CFR 10.75 request for review to the relevant Office Director;\n\nIf the DRP is included in a 21 CFR 10.75 request for review made to the Center, the matter under dispute should already have been the subject of an Advisory Panel meeting, although the Center Director may exercise discretion in this regard;\n\nThe issue should primarily concern a scientific controversy11 and should not involve: Footnote 11: The Center intends to interpret this concept broadly, so as to allow the DRP to consider a range of issues that may be associated with a scientific dispute. For example, a scientific dispute regarding clinical evidence may also involve questions regarding the need for a training program, which could be considered by the DRP within this broader context.\n\nA regulatory, legal, or statutory authority dispute;\n\nactual or alleged criminal activity;\n\nregulatory jurisdiction, such as Designation of Lead Center for a combination product;\n\na matter not within the purview of the Center, such as designation of lead center for a combination product or a dispute already referred to the Commissioner's Office; or (\\circ) allegations of bias or retaliation by FDA employees.\n\nUnder special circumstances, a review under 21 CFR 10.75 may warrant a direct referral to the Center level, including a request to convene the DRP, before the review options at the Division and Office levels have been exhausted. These situations may include, for example, an issue that is of significant interest or impact to the public health, such as an innovative device intended to treat critically ill members of a vulnerable patient population for whom no other viable treatment alternative exists. If a stakeholder believes that such special circumstances exist, the matter should be discussed expeditiously with the Ombudsman.\n\nAppendix E Dispute Resolution Panel Process\n\nAs mentioned earlier, except where a different process is described in this section, the procedures for the DRP generally conforms to the process for FDA's Medical Devices Advisory Committee.12 Once a decision has been made to convene the DRP, the process generally utilized for medical device advisory panel meetings is initiated. However, the sequence of events may be modified on an ad hoc basis as circumstances warrant for a specific DRP meeting.\n\nFootnote 12: Procedures for Meetings of the Medical Device Advisory Committee Guidance issued September 1, 2017 available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/procedures-meetings-medical-devices-advisory-committee.\n\nIn general, the processes governing the DRP are similar to other medical devices advisory panels as described in the Medical Devices Advisory Committee Charter, with some important differences. First, an Advisory Panel is a process used to gather information to inform Center decision-making; a proceeding before the DRP, on the other hand, is an adversarial process in which the Center defends a decision that has already been made. In addition, while an Advisory Panel is convened at the behest of the Agency and is run by the Center, with the applicant as a participant, the DRP provides a forum in which the Center and the applicant are both parties to the issues in dispute.\n--------------------\nContext title: Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.20494556427002"], "In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: Products Manufactured and/or Marketed by More than One Company\n\nEach MAH is responsible for submitting PBRERs for its own products.\n\nWhen companies are involved in contractual relationships (e.g., licensor-licensee), respective responsibilities for preparation and submission of the PBRER to the regulatory authorities should be clearly specified in the written agreement.\n\nWhen data received from a partner company(ies) might contribute meaningfully to the safety, benefit, and/or benefit-risk analyses and influence the reporting company's product information, these data should be included and discussed in the PBRER.\n\nReference Information\n\nAn objective of a PBRER is to evaluate whether information obtained during the reporting interval is in accord with previous knowledge on the product's benefit and risk profile, and to indicate whether changes should be made to the reference product information. Having one reference source of information that can be applied across the three ICH regions would facilitate a practical, efficient, and consistent approach to the benefit-risk evaluation and make the PBRER a unique report accepted in all countries and regions.\n\nThe reference product information for the PBRER would include \"core safety\" and \"approved indications\" components. In order to facilitate the assessment of benefit and benefit-risk by indication in the evaluation sections of the PBRER, the reference product information document should list all approved indications in ICH countries or regions. It is likely that these indications will also apply in other countries or regions. However, when the PBRER is also to be submitted to other countries in which there are additional locally approved indications, these indications may either be added to the reference product information or handled as a regional appendix/appendices as considered most appropriate by the MAH.

The core safety information contained within the CCDS is referred to as the CCSI. A practical option is for MAHs to use the latest CCDS in effect at the end of the reporting interval as the reference product information for both the risk sections of the PBRER as well as the main approved indications for which benefit is evaluated.\n\nWhen the CCDS for a medicinal product does not contain information on approved indications, the MAH should clearly specify which document is used as the reference information for the approved indications in the PBRER.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.772323131561279", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: For PBRERs for products with several indications, formulations, or routes of administration, where there may be significant differences in the identified and potential risks, it may be appropriate to present risks by indication, formulation, or route of administration.

For approved indications, new information on efficacy/effectiveness under conditions of actual use should also be described in this section, if available. New information about efficacy/effectiveness in uses other than the approved indication(s) should not be included, unless relevant for the benefit-risk evaluation in the approved indication. Information on indications approved during the reporting interval should also be included in this section. The level of detail provided in this section should be sufficient to support the characterisation of benefit in Section 17.3 and the benefit-risk assessment in Section 18.\n\nNew information on efficacy/effectiveness might also include changes in the therapeutic environment that could impact efficacy/effectiveness over time, e.g., vaccines, emergence of resistance to anti-infective agents.\n\n3.17.3 Characterisation of Benefits\n\nSection 17.3 of the PBRER provides an integration of the baseline benefit information (see Section 3.17.1) and any relevant new benefit information (see Section 3.17.2) that became available during the reporting interval for approved indications.\n\nThis section should provide a concise but critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the evidence on efficacy/effectiveness, considering the following, when available:\n\nA brief description of the strength of evidence of benefit, considering comparator(s), effect size, statistical rigor, methodological strengths and deficiencies, and consistency of findings across trials/studies;\n\nNew information that challenges the validity of a surrogate endpoint, if used;\n\nClinical relevance of the effect size;\n\nGeneralizability of treatment response across the indicated patient population, e.g., information that demonstrates lack of treatment effect in a sub-population;\n\nAdequacy of characterization of dose-response;\n\nDuration of effect;\n\nComparative efficacy; and\n\nA determination of the extent to which efficacy findings from clinical trials are generalizable to patient populations treated in medical practice.\n\nThe level of detail provided in PBRER Section 17.3 should be sufficient to support the analysis of benefit-risk in Section 18.\n\nWhen there are no new relevant benefit data, this section should provide a characterisation of the information in Section 17.1 of the PBRER.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1780378818511963", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: If stipulated by applicable regional requirements, the MAH should provide, in a regional appendix, information on any final, ongoing, or proposed changes to the national or local authorised product information.\n\nLevel of Detail Within PBRER\n\nThe level of detail provided in certain sections of the PBRER should depend on the medicinal product's known or emerging important benefits and risks. This approach is applicable to those sections of the PBRER in which there is evaluation of safety data, efficacy/effectiveness data, safety signals, and benefit-risk. Therefore, the extent of information provided in such PBRER sections will vary among individual PBRERs.\n\nFor example, when there is important new safety information, a detailed presentation of that information should be included, plus the relevant benefit information, in order to facilitate a robust benefit-risk analysis. Conversely, when little new important safety information has become available during the reporting interval, a concise summary of baseline benefit information should be sufficient, and the benefit-risk evaluation would consist primarily of an evaluation of updated interval safety data.\n\nEfficacy/Effectiveness\n\nFor the purpose of this Guideline, evidence on benefits in clinical trials and in everyday medical practice should be reported. Because the terms are not harmonized across regions, the terms \"efficacy/effectiveness\" are used in this Guideline to clarify that information from both clinical trials and everyday medical practice are within the scope of the information on benefit to be included within the PBRER. In some regions, efficacy refers to evidence of benefit from controlled clinical trials while effectiveness implies use in everyday medical practice. Conversely, in other regions, this distinction is not made.\n\nBenefit-Risk Evaluation\n\nWhen a drug is approved for marketing, a conclusion has been reached that, when used in accordance with approved product information, its benefits outweigh its risks. As new information about the drug emerges during marketing experience, benefit-risk evaluation should be carried out to determine whether benefits continue to outweigh risks, and to consider whether steps need to be taken to improve the benefit-risk balance through risk minimisation activities, e.g., labelling changes, communications with prescribers, or other steps.\n\nPeriodicity and PBRER Data Lock Point\n\n2.8.1 International Birth Date and Data Lock Point\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.4940584897994995", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: Clinical relevance of the effect size;\n\nGeneralizability of treatment response across the indicated patient population, e.g., information that demonstrates lack of treatment effect in a sub-population;\n\nAdequacy of characterization of dose-response;\n\nDuration of effect;\n\nComparative efficacy; and\n\nA determination of the extent to which efficacy findings from clinical trials are generalizable to patient populations treated in medical practice.\n\nThe level of detail provided in PBRER Section 17.3 should be sufficient to support the analysis of benefit-risk in Section 18.\n\nWhen there are no new relevant benefit data, this section should provide a characterisation of the information in Section 17.1 of the PBRER.\n\nWhen there is new positive benefit information and no significant change in the risk profile in this reporting interval, the integration of baseline and new information in this section should be succinct.\n\nIntegrated Benefit-Risk Analysis for Approved Indications\n\nWhereas PBRER Sections 16.4 and 17.3 present the risks and benefits, respectively, Section 18 should provide an integration and critical analysis of the key information in these sections as described below. Section 18 provides the benefit-risk analysis, and should not simply duplicate the benefit and risk characterization presented in Sections 16.4 and 17.3.\n\n3.18.1 Benefit-Risk Context - Medical Need and Important Alternatives\n\nThis section should provide a brief description of the medical need for the medicinal product in the approved indications, and summarise alternatives (medical, surgical, or other; including no treatment).\n\n3.18.2 Benefit-Risk Analysis Evaluation\n\nA benefit-risk profile is specific to an indication and population. For products approved for more than one indication, benefit-risk profiles should be evaluated and presented for each indication individually. If there are important differences in the benefit-risk profiles among populations within an indication, benefit-risk evaluation should be presented by population, if possible. The evaluation should be presented and discussed in a way that facilitates the comparison of benefits and risks, and should take into account the following points:\n\nWhereas previous sections will include all important benefit and risk information, not all benefits and risks contribute importantly to the overall benefit-risk evaluation. Therefore, the key benefits and risks considered in the evaluation should be specified. The key information presented in the previous benefit and risk sections should be carried forward for integration in the benefit-risk evaluation.\n\nConsider the context of use of the medicinal product: the condition to be treated, prevented, or diagnosed; its severity and seriousness; and the population to be treated.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.734891951084137"], "This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 33: The applicability of GLPs to non-clinical studies in a 510(k) submission is also mentioned in FDA\u2019s Guidance \u201cRefuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s\u201d in the Performance Data \u2013 General section of the checklist (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm315014.pdf).\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidanceDocuments/ucm315014.pdf). FDA's draft guidance represents FDA's proposed approach on this topic.\n\nWhen analytical or non-clinical bench performance testing data, or non-clinical animal and/or biocompatibility studies are insufficient, or available scientific methods are not acceptable, e.g., the scientific methods are deemed unacceptable because they are not clinically validated or are not supported by a valid scientific rationale, FDA may request clinical performance data to support a substantial equivalence determination. For 510(k)s reviewed in the Office of Device Evaluation, FDA currently requests clinical data for less than 10 percent of the 510(k) submissions. In some instances, clinical data may be a less burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence than other means of performance testing, and 510(k)s reviewed in CBER for products intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of blood and blood products typically include clinical data. Clinical data provided in support of any marketing application, including a 510(k) when those data are relevant to a substantial equivalence determination, should constitute valid scientific evidence as defined in 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)34 and must comply with the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulations as applicable.35\n\nFootnote 34: 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2): Valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness. Such information may be considered, however, in identifying a device the safety and effectiveness of which is questionable.\n\nAlthough not an exhaustive list of instances in which FDA may request clinical data to demonstrate substantial equivalence,36 the following scenarios illustrate the most common situations in which clinical data may be requested. As explained in the Scope Section (see Section III), the information in this guidance and the examples below do not take the place of any device-specific guidance.\n\nFootnote 36: 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2): Valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness. Such information may be considered, however, in identifying a device the safety and effectiveness of which is questionable.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNote: The examples provided below distinguish between examples that are only applicable to diagnostic devices, including IVDs, and therapeutic devices. This is because there are significant differences in the clinical data requirements for these two categories of devices.\n\n1. New or Modified Indications for Use - Same Intended Use\n\nIn rare instances, FDA may rely upon clinical data to determine that new or modified indications for use fall within the same intended use as a predicate device.\n\nIllustrative Examples:\n\nThe new device is an IVD that is indicated for over-the-counter use, whereas the predicate device is indicated for prescription use in the home or prescription use in a clinical setting. The newly indicated test population might fall within the intended use of the predicate device. Clinical data (demonstrating that the user can collect the sample, generate an accurate result, and adequately interpret the result) might establish that the indication for use for the new device falls within the intended use of the predicate device.\n\nThe new IVD is indicated for use with patients who have symptoms and signs of illness from any member of a specified set of closely related diseases. The indications for use for the predicate IVD do not include one of the diseases addressed by the new IVD. Clinical data (concerning all diseases in the newly specified set) might establish that the indications for use for the new device fall within the intended use of the predicate device.\n\nThe manufacturer modifies the indications for use, explicitly or implicitly, by proposing a different surgical implantation method which also affects the indications for use, e.g., a minimally invasive procedure in place of an open procedure, and the safety and effectiveness of the new device cannot be adequately replicated or otherwise characterized in a non-clinical performance (including animal) test environment to adequately support substantial equivalence to the predicate. Although on its face a minimally invasive procedure would appear to involve less serious risks than an open procedure, the minimally invasive procedure may be less effective or may present different but still serious risks.\n\n2. Technological Differences\n\nFDA may request clinical data for a 510(k) when the technological differences between the new device and predicate device are significant but do not support an immediate NSE determination due to different questions of safety and effectiveness. In these limited situations, clinical data may be needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the new device as compared to the predicate device.\n\nIllustrative Examples:\n\nA new IVD uses the same analyte-specific chemistry as the predicate, but with a different read-out technology (e.g., chemiluminescence instead of colorimetry). Clinical data may be necessary to demonstrate that the new device performs equivalent to the predicate.\n\nPerformance characteristics of the new device in comparison to the predicate are significantly different in non-clinical performance testing, e.g., the predicate is rigid whereas the new device is designed to be more flexible. Clinical data may be necessary to demonstrate that the new device performs equivalent to the predicate.\n\nSome devices that display data about the patient's anatomy or physiology, e.g., glucose meters, pulse oximeters, blood pressure cuffs, are supported by software. If there is a change in the software that relates to how the software analyzes the patient's anatomy or physiology, the device may need to be tested on actual patients to assure that the software performs in a manner that is equivalent to the previous version. In this case, non-clinical data may not suffice.\n\nThe technological characteristics of the new device raise a question concerning whether its clinical performance can be expected to be equivalent to the clinical performance of the predicate. Clinical data may be necessary to demonstrate that the new device performs equivalent to the predicate. For IVDs, an example is a new prothrombin time (clotting) test using thromboplastin that is a recombinant product instead of a naturally occurring material.\n\nNon-clinical Testing Methods are Limited or Inappropriate Because of the Indications for Use or Device Technology\n\nFDA requests clinical data for a 510(k) submission to address issues that cannot be adequately addressed using non-clinical test methods because of the indications for use or device technology. For instance, for certain indications or technologies, FDA may request clinical data when non-clinical testing methods are not validated, are limited or are inappropriate, because of either their scope or their applicability, to demonstrate substantial equivalence.\n\nIllustrative Examples:\n\nFor some devices, the way they are used and the environment in which they are used affect the way they perform. For example, the non-clinical performance testing on the new device may be insufficient to support a substantial equivalence determination if the testing cannot replicate the way the device will be used or the way similar devices have been demonstrated to fail in a clinical setting. Although the non-clinical testing for these devices might be informative for many other aspects of the device, it may be necessary to supplement the non-clinical data with clinical simulation performance data or clinical performance data.\n\nIf the non-clinical testing of a device raises safety concerns that cannot be mitigated or answered through non-clinical testing, such a device may require clinical testing to assure that the safety questions are not greater than those raised by the predicate device.\n--------------------\nContext title: The 510(k) Program- Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)] Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9956742525100708", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Questions and Answers\n\nTHE GLP REGULATIONS - GENERAL\n\nDo the GLPs require the establishment of Technical Operation Manuals?\n\nNo.\n\nIf a laboratory is accredited by AAALAC (American Association for Accreditation of\n\nLaboratory Animal Care), does this serve as assurance of meeting the GLP\n\nrequirements for animal care and facilities?\n\nAAALAC accreditation does not substitute for Agency inspection nor does it guarantee\n\nautomatic compliance with the applicable GLP sections. It is of value, however, in that\n\nit demonstrates that the facility has favorably passed a peer group review.\n\nResults of the quality assurance unit inspections are not routinely available to an\n\nAgency investigator. However, the conforming amendments require that GLP\n\ndeviations are to be reported in detail with each submission to the FDA. Are we\n\nrequired to send the contents of the quality assurance unit inspection report to the\n\nFDA?\n\nNo. The GLP compliance statement in the conforming amendments to the GLPs was\n\nincluded for several reasons:\n\n(a) to provide an orderly transition across the effective date of the regulations. It was\n\nunderstood that applications for research and marketing permits submitted to the\n\nAgency for some period of time after the GLP effective date of June 20, 1979, would\n\ncontain final reports of nonclinical studies begun and completed prior to the effective date, begun prior to the effective date and completed thereafter, and begun and completed after the effective date. Studies begun and completed prior to the effective date are not required to comply with the GLPs and accordingly, the conforming amendments require that differences be noted. Similar considerations apply to studies begun prior to and completed after the effective date, although in these studies, those portions underway as of the effective date are required to comply.\n\n(b) to provide for the submission of final reports of studies, which were not required to comply with the GLPs but which otherwise, contribute to safety evaluation. The GLPs do not apply to safety studies conducted by independent investigators studying regulated products. Such studies are not sponsored by the product manufacturer, nor is there any intention to submit the results to the Agency. The study results are published in the open literature. The sponsor is required red to submit the study to the Agency but could in no way control the research. If the sponsor wishes to use the data in support of the application, the conforming amendments provide a mechanism by which the sponsor can prove that the study was not compromised. A similar situation exists for preliminary exploratory safety studies done by the sponsor.\n\n(c) to foster GLP compliance attitudes by management. The conforming amendment causes management to act responsively to all cases of GLP non-compliance and to take prompt corrective actions.\n\nWith these purposes in mind, the conforming amendments require a brief statement of overall GLP compliance and need not contain the Quality Assurance Unit findings. The Quality Assurance Unit findings should cover short-term GLP deviations, which are promptly corrected. The conforming amendments statement should cover those systematic GLP deviations which have occurred throughout the study.\n\nWho provides the GLP compliance statement required by the conforming amendments?\n\nThis statement is provided by the applicant for the research or marketing permit.\n\nWhat is the degree of compliance with GLPs, which the FDA will require for INDs submitted after June 20, 1979, but which include toxicology studies initiated before June 20, 1979, and completed after June 20, 1979?\n\nThose portions of the studies underway as of the effective date will have to be done in accord with the applicable provisions of the GLPs.\n\nDo nonclinical laboratory studies completed *prior to June 20, 1979 but submitted as part of an IND or NDA subsequent to that date fall under the conforming amendments?\n\nThese studies would not have to have been conducted under the GLPs but the conforming amendment statement of compliance is required.\n\nHow many members of the National Association of Life Science Industries (NALSI) come under the GLPs? How can the membership list be obtained?The Agency has not compiled such a list. A membership list is available from NALSI, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 2oOo6. All members who conduct nonclinical laboratory studies are subject to the GLPs.\n\nShould a contract laboratory ask a sponsor if the article they are testing is subject to FDA regulations? Should these studies then be listed as a separate master list of studies to comply with the GLP regulations? Contract laboratories should ask sponsors to identify studies which are associated with FDA regulated products, although the GLPs place this responsibility on the sponsor. A separate listing of such studies, apart from the firm's master list of all studies undertaken by the firm will satisfy the requirements of the GLPs.\n\nWhat impact have the GLP regulations had on the cost of performing toxicology studies? The president of a large contracting laboratory has stated that three years ago a chronic rat study could be done for about $8o,0oo; and that the current cost is closer $250,000. He estimated that half of the increased cost is due to GLPs, 30% to larger numbers of test animals per study on present day protocols and 20% to inflation. The Agency has not developed cost estimates.\n\n58.1 Scope\n\n58.3 Definitionsapplicability to Studies Performed Under Grants and Contracts\n\n58.15 Inspection of a Testing Facility\n\nAre short-term microbiological screening tests and microbiological preservative stability research and development covered by the GLPs? Microbiological preservative stability research, development and quality control tests are not covered by the GLPs. However, microbiological tests conducted to establish the toxicological profile of an article are covered.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit analytical data collected on a test article? Yes, insofar as it contributes to the evaluation of a nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit draft final protocols and draft final reports? The regulations do not require that such materials be retained, however, if draft reports are available, they may be audited in order to help the Agency follow the process from raw data to final report.\n\nExplain why the GLPs apply to \"microorganisms or subparts thereof.\" How are microorganisms currently used by FDA in assessment of safety? For certain products, FDA does request that microbial tests be done for the purpose of obtaining information on potential neoplastic and mutagenic activity. Likewise, microsomal preparations (subparts thereof) are used as activating systems for certain in vitro tests. When this happens, the tests should be done in accord with the GLPs.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to engineering/electronic testing laboratories that perform functionality tests on medical devices? No.\n\nIs a licensed manufacturer of human biological products subject to continuing GLP inspection? The GLPs apply to safety studies submitted to the Agency in order to obtain the license. They do not apply to such studies conducted for the purpose of obtaining batch release of licensed biologicals.\n\nWill nonclinical studies in support of medical devices which do not come in contact with man (e.g., stopcocks, a gas machine, a urine bag) be subject to the GLP regulations? If the medical device application for a research or marketing permit does not require the submission of safety data for approval, then the GLPs do not apply.\n\nIf a test article is produced by microbial fermentation, are tests run on the bacteria, such as pathogenicity or virulence covered by the GLPs? No.\n\nAre studies performed for label purposes as required by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act considered to be nonclinical laboratory studies under the GLPs? No.\n\nWhen an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving \"diagnostic products\" and \"medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man\" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.101834774017334", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Center For Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nThe FDA published Good Guidance Practices in February 1997.\n\nThis guidance was developed and issued prior to that date.\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Communications Management\n\nDrug Information Branch, HFD-210\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\n(Internet)  http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug AdministrationJUN 1981\n\nGOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE REGULATIONS\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSAERS\n\nSince June 20, 1979, the agency has been asked many questions on the Good Laboratory Practice regulations (GLPs, 21 CFR 58). In accord with agency procedures, responses have been prepared and copies of the associated correspondence have been filed in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305). The responses have also been provided to the bioresearch monitoring program managers and to the district offices in order to ensure consistency of interpretation and equity of program operation. Unfortunately, the numerous filed correspondences contain many repeat questions that are not categorized to relate to the specific GLP suooart and section. On occasion, the answers appear to be somewhat cryptic. These disadvantages serve to limit the utility of the correspondences as advisories to our headquarters and field offices.\n\nThis document, therefore, consolidates all GLP questions answered by the agency during the past 2 years, clarifies the questions and answers as needed, and relates the questions and answers to the specific pertinent provisions of the GLPs. It represents a digest of some 30 letters, 160 memoranda of telephone conversations, 34 memoranda of meetings and 30 miscellaneous correspondences that have been issued by agency personnel. The document does not duplicate questions and answers that were dealt with in the August, 1979 Post Conference Report on the Gooa Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings.\n\nThis document should be reviewed by field investigators prior to making GLP inspections and by headquarters personnel involved in the GLP program. Questions should be directed to:\n\nDr. Paul D. Lepore\n\nBioresearcn Monitoring Staff, HFC-30\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fisher's Lane\n\nRockville, MD 2C857\n\n301-443-2390SUBPART A GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSection 58.1 Scope.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to validation trials conducted to confirm the analytical methods used to determine the concentration of test article in animal tissues and drug dosage forms?\n\nNo.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to the following studies on animal health products: overdosage studies in the target species, animal safety studies in the target species, tissue residue accumulation and depletion studies, and udder irritation studies?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to safety studies on cosmetic products?\n\nNo. Such studies are not carried out in support of a marketing permit. However, the GLPs represent good quality control; a goal that all testing facilities should strive to attain.\n\nDo safety studies done to determine the potential drug abuse characteristics of a test article have to be done under the GLPs?\n\nYes they do, but only when the studies are required to be submitted to the agency as part of an application for a research or marketing permit.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to the organoleptic evaluation of processed foods?\n\nNo.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to all of the analytical support work conducted to provide supplementary data to a safety study?\n\nThe GLPs apply to the chemical procedures used to characterize the test article, to determine the stability of the test article and its mixtures, and to determine the homogeneity and concentration of test article mixtures. Likewise, the GLPs apply to the chemical procedures used to analyze specimens (e.g. clinical chemistry, urimals!). The GLPs do not apply to the work done to develop chemical methods of analysis or to establish the specifications of a test article.\n\nIs it possible to obtain an exemption from specific provisions of the GLPs for special nonclinical laboratory studies?\n\nYes. The GLPs were written with the aim of being applicable to a broad variety of studies, test articles and test systems. Nonetheless, the agency realizes that not all of the GLP provisions apply to all studies and, indeed, For some special studies certain of the GLP provisions may compromise proper science. For this reason, laboratories may petition the agency for exemption for certain studies from some of the GLP provisions. The petition should contain sufficient facts to justify granting the exemption.\n\nAre subcontractor laboratories that furnish a particular service such as ophthalmology exams, reading of animal ECGs, EEGs, EMGs, preparation of blocks and slides from tissues, statistical analysis and hematology covered by the GLPs?\n\nYes, to the extend that they contribute to a study that is subject to the GLPs.\n\nSection 58.3 Definitions.\n\nAre animal cage cards considered to be raw data?\n\nRaw data is defined as \"any laboratory worksheets, records, memorandum, notes....that are the result of original observations and activities....and are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the report of that study.\" Cage cards are not raw data if they contain information like animal number, study number, study dates, and cage number (information that is not the result of - original observations and that is not necessary for study reconstruction). However, if an original observation is put on the cage cards, then all cards must be saved as raw data.\n\nAre photo copies of raw data which are dated and verified by signature of the copier considered to be \"exact\" copies of the raw data?\n\nYes.\n\nAre records of quarantine, animal receipt, environmental monitoring, and instrument calibration considered to be raw data?\n\nYes.\n\nA laboratory conducts animal studies to establish a baseline set of data for a different test species/strain. No test article is administered but the toxicology laboratory facilities and procedures will be used and the resulting data may eventually be submitted do the agency as part of a research or marketing permit. Are the studies considered to be nonclinical laboratory studies that are covered by the GLPs? Generally, a nonclinical laboratory study involves a test article studied under laboratory conditions for the purpose of determining its safety. The cited example does not fit the definition so it would not be covered by the GLPs. Since the data from the baseline studies may be used to interpret the results of a nonclinical laboratory study, it is recommended, but not required, that the study be conducted in accord with GLPs in order to ensure valid baseline data.\n\nThe definition of \"nonclinical laboratory study\" excludes field trials in animals. What is a field trial in animals? A field trial in animals is similar to a human clinical trial. It is conducted for the purpose of obtaining data on animal drug efficacy and it is excluded from coverage under the GLPs.\n\nNecropsies are done by prosectors trained by and working under the supervision of a pathologist. The necropsy data are recorded by the prosector on data sheets, and when making the final report, the pathologist summarizes the data collected by the prosector as well as by him/herself. What constitutes the raw data in this example? Both the prosector's data sheets as well as the signed and dated report of the pathologist would be considered raw data.\n\nIs a computer print-out derived from data transferred to computer media from laboratory data sheets considered to be raw data? No.\n\nAre the assay plates used in the 10t1/2 mammalian cell transformation assay considered to be specimens? Yes.\n\nIf a firm uses parapatnologists to screen tissue preparations, are the parapatnologists' data sheets considered to be raw data? Yes.\n\nSection 58.10 Applicability to studies performed under grants and contracts.\n\nCertain contracts specify that a series of nonclinical laboratory studies be done on a single test article. Do the GLPs permit the designation of different study directors for each study under the contract?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs require that a sponsor approve the study director for a contracted study?\n\nNo. Testing facility management designates the study director.\n\nA firm functions as a primary contractor for nonclinical laboratory studies. The actual studies are then subcontracted to nonclinical laboratories. Is the firm considered to be a \"sponsor?\"\n\nThe GLPs define \"sponsor\" as a person who initiates and supports a nonclinical laboratory study. Sponsorship in the cited example would be determined by the specific provisions of the contract.\n\nWho is responsible for test article characterization - the sponsor or the contractor?\n\nThe GLPs do not assign the responsibility in this area. The matter is a subject of the specific contractual arrangement between the sponsor and the contractor.\n\nDo contract laboratories have to show the sponsor's name on the Master Schedule Sheet or can this information be coded?\n\nThe information can be coded but the code must be revealed to the FDA investigator on request.\n\nA sponsor desires to contract for a nonclinical laboratory study to be conducted in a foreign laboratory. Must the sponsor notify the foreign laboratory that compliance with the U.S. GLPs is required?\n\nYes.\n\nMust a contractor include in the final report information on test article characterization and stability when such information has been collected by the sponsor?\n\nNo. The contractor should identify in its final report which information will be subsequently supplied by the sponsor.\n\nMust a sponsor reveal toxicology data already collected on a test article to a contract laboratory?\n\nNo. If use of the test article involves a potential danger to laboratory personnel, the contract laboratory should be advised so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.345546722412109", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Industry requested a detailed flowchart that would identify the type of supplement to be submitted based on any specific change for any device. FDA understands that there is a general desire among PMA applicants for such a detailed flowchart or easy-to-use paradigm. However, FDA believes the complexity and variability of class III devices makes it unfeasible to develop such a flowchart.\n\nIndustry requested specific definitions for some terms, such as \"substantial clinical data,\" \"significant change,\" and \"limited confirmatory clinical data.\" Where possible, FDA provided additional clarity for some terminology. Again, because of the complexity and variability of class III devices, we do not believe it is feasible to provide detailed definitions for certain terms and instead use examples to help illustrate the meaning of these terms.\n\nIndustry requested that the guidance address 30-day supplements (21 CFR 814.39(e)). However, FDA has chosen not to include 30-day supplements within the scope of the guidance document, in part, because we have not identified cases for which this provision can be effectively applied.\n\nIndustry requested the addition of examples to illustrate the various supplement types as well as periodic reports. While industry provided a number of examples, many such examples did not contain sufficient details for inclusion in this guidance document. However, examples that provided further clarification on the underlying principles were added. In addition, the periodic report section was significantly increased in detail and includes examples.\n\nIII General Requirements for When a PMA Supplement is Needed\n\nExamples of the types of modifications that require a PMA supplement (21 CFR 814.39(a)), if such changes affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nnew indications for use of the device;\n\nlabeling changes;\n\nthe use of a different facility or establishment to manufacture, process, or package the device;\n\nchanges in sterilization procedures;\n\nchanges in packaging;\n\nchanges in the performance or design specifications, circuits, components, ingredients, principle of operation, or physical layout of the device; and * extension of the expiration date of the device based on data obtained under a new or revised shelf life testing protocol that has not been approved by FDA. If FDA has approved your protocol, the change should be reported in a periodic report (21 CFR 814.39(b)).\n\nUnder 21 CFR 814.39(f), you may submit, instead of a PMA supplement, a 30-day notice for changes to manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacture that affect the safety and effectiveness of your device. We recommend that you carefully assess whether a PMA supplement (21 CFR 814.39(a)) or a 30-day notice (21 CFR 814.39(f)) is appropriate for any modification you plan to undertake. The Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) requires that you have in place a system to document and assess design changes (21 CFR 820.30). Part of the assessment for all changes should include a risk analysis and validation (or, where appropriate, verification) of the changes to the design or manufacturing process and subsequent assessment of the need for regulatory submission. (More information regarding 30-day notices is provided in Section F of this guidance document.)\n\nIV Determining the Type of PMA Submission\n\nA primary indicator of what type of PMA submission is needed is the nature of the data, if any, that is needed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the modified device. Each of the following sections describes one of the various types of PMA submissions that may be submitted to FDA (traditional PMA, a panel-track supplement, a 180-day supplement, a real-time supplement, a Special PMA Supplement - Changes Being Effected, 30-day notice, and manufacturing site change supplement). For each type of PMA submission, we discuss the kinds of changes we would consider to be appropriate for the type of submission, the general nature of test data we believe are needed to support the safety and effectiveness of such changes, and criteria we may use when determining whether that type of submission should be submitted.\n\nWe also provide, in each section, examples of device modifications submitted to CDRH/Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), CDRH/Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD), and CBER to illustrate what we believe are appropriate submissions for the type of PMA submission discussed in that section. For each example, we provide the specific changes that were made to the approved device, the impact that changes had on the intended patients or on the use of the device, and the test data that FDA believes are needed to demonstrate that the modified device remains safe and effective.\n\nThe examples below illustrate how FDA determines which particular supplement type is warranted. These examples are straightforward in nature to demonstrate the underlying principles. We expect that there may be more complex situations. If you need additional input from FDA to determine the appropriate supplement type, please contact the appropriate review branch or division.\n\nFigure 1 at the end of this guidance document illustrates the steps we recommend you follow in selecting the appropriate regulatory path for a modification to your PMA device.\n\nAppendix A When to Submit a Traditional PMA\n\nIn general, a traditional PMA (rather than a PMA supplement) is appropriate when the modifications you make to your approved PMA device result in a new device. We would consider a new device to be one where a modification results in a device design so different from the original version that the preclinical3 (\"analytical\" for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs)) and clinical data4 you previously submitted on your original device are not applicable (i.e., not supportive) for the specific change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the modified device.\n\nFootnote 3: For purposes of this guidance document, the term \u201cprecilical testing\u201d refers to non-clinical testing that is used to characterize a device (e.g., animal, bench, biocompatibility, electrical safety, software, reproducibility, reliability, accuracy, limit of detection, analytical testing).\n\nFootnote 4: For purposes of this guidance document, the term \u201cclinical data\u201d refers to data derived from a study using a patient population with a defined clinical condition to determine the safety and effectiveness of the device, including clinical performance characteristics (e.g., clinical specificity, clinical sensitivity). Clinical data are not limited to data obtained from an investigational device exemption (IDE) study and could include foreign data and literature.\n\nIn deciding whether to submit a supplement to your approved traditional PMA or to submit a new traditional PMA5 for a modified device, we recommend you first ascertain whether, and to what extent, you can rely on the preclinical testing and clinical data submitted in your traditional PMA to support the safety and effectiveness of your modified device. If you need to conduct both new preclinical testing and new clinical testing to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the modified device, you should assume that this is a new device that will require a submission of a new traditional PMA.6\n\nFootnote 5: In lieu of a traditional PMA, you may submit a modular PMA. The criteria and process for the modular review program are discussed in Premarket Approval Application Modular Review Program available at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/835.html.\n\nFootnote 6: For the purposes of this guidance document, new preclinical or clinical data are those collected in accordance with an existing or different protocol.\n\nThe examples below illustrate when FDA has considered a traditional PMA to be appropriate for a device modification based on the types of changes made and the testing that was necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Each example describes a device reviewed in ODE, unless indicated as reviewed in OIVD or CBER.\n\nAppendix A Modified Device for a New Indication for Use\n\nFDA approved a PMA for the TransMyocardial Revascularization (TMR) holmium laser for surgical treatment of stable patients with angina that is refractory to medical treatment and not amenable to direct coronary revascularization. In this procedure, the chest is opened by surgical incision. Once the heart is exposed, the surgeon places the end of a fiber light guide onto the surface of the epicardium and the laser is activated making a hole through the ventricular wall, penetrating entirely through the wall into the ventricular cavity. This is repeated at several locations in the region to be treated.\n\nThe PMA applicant modified its laser system by incorporating it into a fiber optic guide to make it suitable for percutaneous use. The PMA applicant also modified the indication for use toinclude percutaneous myocardial revascularization (PMR), a non-surgical procedure. In PMR, the surgeon percutaneously places a catheter containing a fiber optic light guide into the left ventricle and uses the laser to make several gouges in the endocardium (inside) ventricular wall.\n--------------------\nContext title: Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.741785049438477", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: 58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n\nThe GLPs permit these materials to be stored in the archives of either the testing laboratory or the sponsor. If they are stored in the sponsor's archives, the archives of the testing laboratory must identify the storage location.\n\nIf a sponsor agrees to characterize and store test articles submitted for study to a contractor, must the contractor also verify the characterization and provide storage for the test articles? No, but the contractor must identify the storage location.\n\nWhat is the \"completion date\" of a nonclinical laboratory study? The completion date is the date that the study director signs the final report. Some discretion must be used however, since the protocol calls for a proposed \"completion date.\" In this case, it would be adequate for the protocol to list a completion date for the in vivo phase and qualify it as such.\n\nWith respect to archival material, what is required to be listed as the date of the study? The study date would be the same as the completion date of the study.\n\nDo all studies on a test article need to be submitted in support of an application for a research or marketing permit? All studies need be submitted, however, not all studies need be conducted in accord with the GLPs. The conforming amendments provide that a statement be included in the submission which identifies which studies have not been conducted in compliance with the GLPs and the extent of the non-compliance.\n\nWhat should be included in the signed and dated reports of the individual scientists participating in the study? The final report prepared by the study director should have appended to it all reports written by other participating scientists. These reports should contain sufficient detail to enable the study director to write a final report, which reflects the results of the study.\n\nSubpart K Disqualification of Testing Facilities\n\n58.200 Purposes\n\n58.202 Grounds for Disqualification\n\n58.204 Notice of And Opportunity for Hearing on Proposed Disqualification\n\n58.210 actions UPON DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.213 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION REGARDING\n\nDISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.215 alternative OR ADDtional actions TO DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.217 suspension OR TERMINATION OF A TESTING FACILITY BY A SPONSOR\n\n58.219 reinstatement OF A DISQUALIFI TESTING FACILITY\n\nENFORCEMENT STRategy\n\nWhat can FDA do to force a laboratory to take corrective actions to achieve compliance with the GLPs? Are warnings given to the laboratory?\n\nFDA has a number of regulatory sanctions, which can be brought to bear on a violative firm in order to, bring about compliance with the law. These include rejection of studies, withdrawal of approval of marketed products if such products are supported by defective studies, prosecution and, after June 20, 1979, disqualification of the laboratory. FDA's present GLP enforcement policy is to provide adequate warning and to afford a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.\n\nDisqualifying a laboratory on the basis of failing to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs raises the question of whether all violations are considered-equally, are weighted, or are evaluated scientifically to consider the impact on the outcome of the study.\n\nA laboratory will not be considered for disqualification unless all of the following criteria are met:\n\nThe violations of the various provisions of the GLPs are evaluated to assess their impact on the validity of the studies. It is impossible to assign weights to the various provisions of the GLPs. Noncompliance with the various provisions must be evaluated in the context of the entire laboratory operation and the kinds of studies being performed. Thus, a violation of a specific provision may be critical for one laboratory doing long-term studies and not for another laboratory engaged in short term studies.\n\na. failure to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs;\n\nb. the noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the studies;\n\nc. other lesser regulatory actions (warnings, rejection of individual studies) have not or will not be adequate to achieve compliance with the GLPs.\n\nIf a laboratory is disqualified, how long does the disqualification last? Under what conditions does reinstatement occur?The disqualification will last until the laboratory submits in writing to the Commissioner, reasons for reinstatement including a detailed description of the corrective actions it has taken to assure that the violations which led to disqualification will not recur. Reinstatement will depend upon one or more inspections which show that the laboratory is in compliance with GLPs.\n\nParagraph 231 of the preamble to the GLPs states: \"The order of disqualification creates a rebuttable presumption that all studies previously conducted by the facility are unacceptable. Paragraph 226 states: \"Studies conducted at facilities that are in substantial compliance will be presumed to be valid.\" Can we presume that studies conducted during a period when a lab is found to be substantially in compliance will be accepted by FDA as valid even if the laboratory is disqualified at a later date?\n\nYes, unless FDA develops information to the contrary.\n4. If a contract laboratory is disqualified because of a study performed for one sponsor, what effect does this have on other studies performed for other sponsors? What about studies underway at the time of disqualification?\n\nFDA will not disqualify a laboratory on the basis of one invalid study. Disqualification is viewed as a most serious regulatory sanction by FDA and will only be imposed when the facts demonstrate that the laboratory is incapable of producing valid scientific data and will not take adequate corrective measures. In the event a laboratory is disqualified, all studies performed by the laboratory, including those in progress are presumed to be unacceptable unless the sponsors of those studies can establish, to the satisfaction of FDA, that the studies were not affected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification.\n5. What steps must be taken by FDA prior to removal of a product from the market because of a rejected study which was pivotal to the assessment of safety?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.948561191558838", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.10.2 Studies During Clinical Development\n\nAdditional studies may be warranted to clarify observed or suspected adverse effects in animals and humans during clinical development.\n\n2.10.3 Studies Before Approval\n\nSafety pharmacology effects on systems listed in section 2.8 should be assessed prior to product approval, unless not warranted, in which case this should be justified. Available information from toxicology studies adequately designed and conducted to address safety pharmacology endpoints, or information from clinical studies, can support this assessment and replace safety pharmacology studies.\n\nApplication of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)\n\nIt is important to ensure the quality and reliability of non-clinical safety studies. This is normally accomplished through the conduct of the studies in compliance with GLP. Due to the unique design of, and practical considerations for, some safety pharmacology studies, it may not be feasible to conduct these in compliance with GLP. It has to be emphasized that data quality and integrity in safety pharmacology studies should be ensured even in the absence of formal adherence to the principles of GLP. When studies are not conducted in compliance with GLP, study reconstruction should be ensured through adequate documentation of study conduct and archiving of data. Any study or study component not conducted in compliance with GLP should be adequately justified, and the potential impact on evaluation of the safety pharmacology endpoints should be explained.\n\nThe safety pharmacology core battery should ordinarily be conducted in compliance with GLP. Follow-up and supplemental studies should be conducted in compliance with GLP to the greatest extent feasible. Safety pharmacology investigations can be part of toxicology studies; in such cases, these studies would be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nPrimary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nGenerally, secondary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP. Results from secondary pharmacodynamic studies conducted during the compound selection process may contribute to the safety pharmacology evaluation; when there is no cause for concern (e.g., there are no findings for the safety pharmacological endpoint or the chemical or therapeutic class), these studies need not be repeated in compliance with GLP. In some circumstances, results of secondary pharmacodynamic studies may make a pivotal contribution to the safety evaluation for potential adverse effects in humans, and these are normally conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\n3 Notes\n--------------------\nContext title: S7A_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.264342784881592"], "Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Answer: In addition to the names of the investigators, the names and addresses of all facilities that took part in the investigation are required, such as the investigational sites, laboratories, and specimen collection sites.34 Additionally, if study records are maintained at other locations, such as an investigator's office, the names and addresses of those locations must also be provided.35 If the location(s) of the records change, FDA should be notified. No additional information is needed to meet this requirement.\n\nFootnote 34: \u00a73 FR 7366, see comment 29.\n\n(2) Investigator qualifications (Section 812.28(b)(2))\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet this requirement?\n\nAnswer: In general, the information provided on investigator qualifications should be adequate to show that the investigator is qualified to serve as an investigator based on his or her training and experience specifically related to the clinical investigation.36\n\nFootnote 36: \u00a73 FR 7366, see comment 30.\n\nSuch documentation generally includes a curriculum vitae or summary of training and experience. If this information is already included elsewhere within the application or submission, referencing the appropriate section within the application or submission is acceptable. For research involving novel technologies and/or the potential for increased risk of morbidity and/or mortality, the sponsor or applicant should include additional documentation identifying the clinical investigator's specific experience in this field (e.g., as demonstrated by recent presentations or publications) and with the test article.\n\nAdditionally, the GCP standard the sponsor or applicant follows may address information to maintain on investigator qualifications. See Section III.B.(3) below for further information.\n\n(3) Description of the research facilities (Section 812.28(b)(3))\n\nIs the name and address of the research facility a sufficient description to address this requirement?__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnswer: No, the name and address of the research facility is generally not a sufficient description to meet the requirement in 21 CFR 812.28(b)(3). Because FDA is generally less likely to be familiar with the research facilities in which OUS investigations are conducted, greater detail is usually needed. It would generally be adequate to identify and describe the academic medical center, hospital, physician's office, clinical research unit or other type of facility at which the investigation was conducted. The description should include enough information to enable FDA to determine the adequacy of the facilities to execute the investigation and meet its requirements (e.g., whether the site is appropriately staffed and equipped to conduct the investigation and is able to provide the appropriate emergent or specialized care, if required).37\n\nFootnote 37: 83 FR 7366, see comment 30.\n\nAdditionally, the GCP standard the sponsor or applicant follows may address information to maintain on investigator and research facility selection. For example, ISO 14155:2011 addresses verification and documentation of the qualifications of the principal investigator(s) and the adequacy of the research facility and the rationale for selecting the facility in sections 5.8, 9.2, and 9.3.\n\nThe investigator's qualifications and the description of the research facilities will also help us to assess the need for an onsite inspection.\n\n(4) Detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation, and if requested, case records or additional background data (Section 812.28(b)(4))\n\nWould a clinical investigation report satisfy the requirement to provide a detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation?\n\nAnswer: Yes, submitting an integrated, detailed clinical investigation report that includes a detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation would meet this requirement, although alternative approaches may also be acceptable. For example, if a sponsor or applicant chooses, FDA would accept the clinical investigation report as described in Annex D of ISO 14155:2011 as a detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation.38\n\nFootnote 38: 83 FR 7366, see comment 31.\n\nA detailed clinical investigation report is commonly submitted for clinical investigations that contribute to the evaluation of the safety or effectiveness of the device for the proposed indication or that otherwise support information included in proposed labeling for the product. Sponsors and applicants are reminded that, even if they submit such a detailed clinical investigation report, they must also submit any additional information that is required elsewhere in 21 CFR parts 807, 812 or 814.\n\nWill FDA need access to case records maintained by the investigator or additional background data such as hospital or other institutional records?\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]\n\n(6) Discussion demonstrating that the data and information constitute valid scientific evidence (Section 812.28(b)(6))\n\nWhat data and information constitute valid scientific evidence under 21 CFR 860.7?\n\nAnswer: Adherence to GCP standards alone does not ensure that the data collected constitute valid scientific evidence. As defined in 21 CFR 860.7, valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness.49 Note: the sponsor or applicant should also explain how the OUS data are applicable to the US population and US medical practice.50\n\nFootnote 49: 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2).\n\nFootnote 50: Under 21 CFR 814.15, if a PMA application is based solely on OUS clinical data, the application may be approved if, among other criteria, the OUS clinical data are applicable to the US population and US medical practice.\n\n(7) The name and address of the IEC that reviewed the investigation and a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t) (Section 812.28(b)(7))\n\nWhat does FDA consider an \"adequately constituted\" IEC?\n\nAnswer: FDA regulations at 21 CFR 812.3(t) define an IEC as \"an independent review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of subjects involved in a clinical investigation and is adequately constituted to ensure that protection.\" FDA believes an \"adequately constituted\" IEC is one that consists of a reasonable number of members who collectively have the qualifications and experience to review and evaluate the science, medical aspects and ethics of the proposed clinical investigation.\n\nFDA recommends that every nondiscriminatory effort be made to ensure that the IEC composition is not limited to only one gender and that it reflects the social and cultural diversity of the community(ies) from which research participants are most likely to be drawn.51 It is further advised that only those members who are independent of the investigator and the sponsor of the investigation vote on investigation-related matters.52 FDA recognizes that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of the local needs ofthe host country. Such variation is acceptable as long as the IEC can ensure the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in the clinical investigation.\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet the requirement to provide a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t)?\n\nAnswer: The sponsor or applicant is required by 21 CFR 812.28(b)(7) to provide the name and address of the IEC that reviewed the investigation and a statement that the IEC meets the definition in 21 CFR 812.3(t). As stated in the preamble, in addition to the sponsor or applicant, it would be acceptable for the IEC to submit a statement that the IEC that reviewed the investigation meets the definition of an IEC in the rule.53\n\nSponsors and applicants may also consider a waiver request, as described in Section III.C, if they are unable to provide a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t). A waiver request could identify, as an alternative to the statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t), a statement that the IEC is organized and operates according to the applicable laws and regulations of the country where it operates and provide a description of the laws and regulations under which the IEC is organized and operates.54 FDA will decide whether to grant or deny a waiver on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all appropriate circumstances.\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet the requirement to maintain information to support the statement required by section 812.28(b)(7) that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t)?\n--------------------\nContext title: Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.0751218795776367", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: The regulations do not require that the investigator be a physician. Sponsors are required to select only investigators qualified by training and experience as appropriate experts to investigate the drug (21 CFR 312.53(a)). In the event the clinical investigator is a non-physician, a qualified physician (or dentist, when appropriate) should be listed as a subinvestigator for the trial and should be responsible for all trial-related medical (or dental) decisions. (ICH E6 section 4.3.1;\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073122.pdf).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5.1.5 What are the minimum qualifications of an investigator?\n\nAs stated in #4, the regulations require that sponsors select investigators who are qualified by training and experience as appropriate experts to investigate the drug. The regulations do not specify the minimum requirements nor do the regulations specify what qualifications an investigator must have in order to be considered qualified by training and experience to conduct a clinical investigation. Sponsors have discretion in determining what qualifications, training, and experience will be needed, based on the general recognition that this would include familiarity with human subject protection (HSP) regulations (i.e., 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) and practices as well as good clinical practice (GCP) regulations (see 21 CFR Part 312) and standards (e.g., ICH E6) for the conduct of clinical studies.\n\n6. Does the 1572 need to be submitted to FDA?\n\nNo. Although the sponsor is required to collect the 1572 from the investigator, FDA does not require the form to be submitted to the agency. Many sponsors submit the 1572 to FDA, however, because it collects, in one place, information that must be submitted to FDA under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(6)(iii)(b).\n\n7. When must a 1572 be updated or a new 1572 completed and signed by an investigator to reflect new or changed information?\n\nThere are two instances when it is necessary for an investigator to complete and sign a new 1572: when an investigator is participating in a new protocol that has been added to the IND and when a new investigator is added to the study (21 CFR 312.53(c)).\n\nIf there are other changes to information contained on a signed and dated 1572 (e.g., an IRB address change, the addition of new subinvestigators, the addition of a clinical research lab), the investigator should document the changes in the clinical study records and inform the sponsor of these changes, so that the sponsor can appropriately update the IND. The 1572 itself does not need to be revised and a new 1572 need not be completed and signed by the investigator. The sponsor can accumulate certain changes and submit this information to the IND in, for example, an information amendment or a protocol amendment.\n\n8. If a clinical investigation is not conducted under an IND or is for a medical device, must investigators sign a 1572?\n\nNo. Under the regulations, a 1572 is only required for studies of investigational drugs and biologics conducted under an IND. It is not required for studies that are not done under an IND, and is not applicable to investigational device studies. Sponsors of device studies must obtain a signed investigator agreement (containing information similar to that requested on the 1572) from each participating investigator, per 21 CFR 812.43(c).\n\n9 Must a sponsor conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND?\n\nNo. A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived (see #12 and #13 below). When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that this study complies with 21 CFR 312.120, \"Foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND,\" if the sponsor intends to submit the study to FDA to support clinical investigations conducted in the United States and/or marketing approval. An application based solely on foreign clinical data must meet criteria listed in 21 CFR 314.106.\n\n10 Must investigators who conduct studies outside of the United States sign a 1572?3\n\nIf a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, then all FDA IND regulations, including the requirement to obtain a signed 1572, must be met. If a clinical study is conducted outside of the U.S. and is not conducted under an IND, then the investigator need not sign a 1572. If local laws or regulations prohibit the signing of a 1572, FDA would expect the sites to operate as non-IND sites and the study conducted as a non-IND study. If the study data is to be submitted to support a marketing application (e.g., a new drug application (NDA)), the study must be conducted in compliance with 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nIf a foreign clinical study is being conducted under an IND, what are the investigator's responsibilities with respect to local laws and regulations?\n\nInvestigators are responsible for complying with the applicable laws and regulations of the country in which the study is being conducted, regardless of whether the study is being conducted under an IND. We recommend that sponsors obtain signed, written statements from investigators acknowledging their commitment to comply with local laws and requirements. In addition, if a foreign clinical study is being conducted under an IND, the investigator must sign Form FDA 1572 (investigator statement) and ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the investigator statement and all other applicable regulations under 21 CFR Part 312.\n\nFor foreign clinical studies conducted under an IND, how can an investigator sign the 1572 when the investigator knows he/she cannot commit to all of the requirements on the form, specifically IRB membership (21 CFR 56.107)?\n\nIRB review and approval is required before a clinical study can be initiated under an IND (21 CFR 56.103(a)). FDA may waive any of the IRB requirements for specific research activities or for classes of research activities otherwise covered by the IRB regulations (21 CFR 56.105), but FDA uses the waiver provision only when alternative mechanisms for ensuring protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects are acceptable. The most common circumstance for which FDA receives a waiver request is when a sponsorwishes to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. In this case, typically an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is utilized instead of a U.S. IRB. Although its membership and functions for assuring human subject protection are comparable to an IRB, an IEC may not meet all of the IRB requirements contained in 21 CFR Part 56.\n\nFor a foreign study, an IRB waiver request should contain a description of alternative mechanisms for assuring human subject protection. It would generally be acceptable for a waiver request to state the intention to use an IEC that complies with GCP (e.g., ICH E6) instead of an IRB that complies with 21 CFR Part 56.\n\nThe sponsor should submit the waiver request to the IND under which the study will be conducted. The IND will have been submitted to the appropriate review division in either the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nThe sponsor will be informed by the agency in writing whether the waiver request is denied or granted. If a waiver is granted, the sponsor should have investigators attach a copy of the letter granting the waiver to the signed 1572 in the investigator's record.\n\n13. If a sponsor chooses to conduct a foreign clinical study (or operate non-US sites in a multinational study) under an IND and the investigators at these non-US sites comply with the ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, would the non-US investigators also be in compliance with FDA's IND requirements under 21 CFR Part 312?\n\nYes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.008450508117676", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Do individuals who are listed in Section #6 on the 1572 have to submit information about their financial interests?\n\nYes. Under 21 CFR Part 54 (Disclosure of Financial Interests by Clinical Investigators), a person listed or identified as an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects must submit financial disclosure information to the sponsor. For purposes of this financial disclosure regulation, the term investigator also includes the spouse and each dependent child of the investigator and subinvestigator. (21 CFR 54.2(d) and 54.4). For additional information about financial disclosure, see FDA's Guidance for Industry Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm)VIII Section #7: Name and Code Number, If Any, of the Protocol(s) in the Ind for Study(ies) to be Conducted by the Investigator\n\n36. What information should be included in this section?\n\nList the name and code number (if any) of all the protocols under the IND that will be conducted by the investigator signing the 1572. A code number is an identifying number assigned by the sponsor.\n\nAs a reminder, some investigators may be responsible for submitting certain clinical trial information to the National Institutes of Health clinical trials data bank under 42 U.S.C. 282(j), 402(j) of the Public Health Service Act. Although not all investigators will be expected to meet this requirement, go to www.clinicaltrials.gov for further information about potential responsibilities.\n\nIX Section #8: Clinical Protocol Information\n\n37. How should Section #8 be completed for a phase 4 study?\n\nPhase 4 refers to the timing of a clinical study (i.e., postmarketing) rather than the characteristics of the study, which are described under 21 CFR 312.21, Phases of an investigation. A postmarketing clinical trial would meet the description of a phase 2 or 3 investigation and a full protocol would be submitted. The investigator does not need to mark either of the boxes in Section #8, but should identify in Section #7 that the study is a phase 4 study.\n\n38. Can an investigator submit the study protocol instead of an outline of the study protocol?\n\nYes. The protocol or a detailed description is required for any phase 2 or 3 clinical trial. Phase 1 studies can be supported by an outline (see 21 CFR 312.53).\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.0016350746154785", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1?

Inspections (21 CFR 812.145)\n\nInvestigators are required to permit FDA to inspect and copy any records pertaining to the investigation including, in certain situations, those which identify subjects.\n\n5. Submitting Reports (21 CFR 812.150)\n\nAn investigator shall prepare and submit the following complete, accurate, and timely reports:\n\na. To the sponsor and the IRB:\n\n(1) Any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an\n\ninvestigation. (Due no later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.)\n\n(2) Progress reports on the investigation. (These reports must be provided at regular intervals, but in no event\n\nless often than yearly. If there is a study monitor, a copy of the report should also be sent to the monitor.)(3) Any deviation from the investigational plan made to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (Report is due as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurs. Except in emergency situations, a protocol deviation requires prior sponsor approval; and if the deviation may affect the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects, prior FDA and IRB approval are required.)\n\n(4) Any use of the device without obtaining informed consent. (Due within 5 working days after such use.)\n\n(5) A final report. (Due within 3 months following termination or completion of the investigation or the investigator's part of the investigation.

To the Sponsor:\n\n(1) Withdrawal of IRB approval of the investigator's part of an investigation. (Due within 5 working days of such action).\n\n6. Investigational Device Distribution and Tracking\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit an investigator from providing an investigational device to any person not authorized to receive it (21 CFR 812.110(c)). The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor the shipping, use, and final disposal of the device(s). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). Investigators must also maintain complete, current and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of investigational devices (21 CFR 812.140(a)(2)). Specific investigator recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a).\n\n7. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n8. Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports\n\nThe IDE regulations do not specify the content of the annual progress or final reports. With respect to reports to the IRB, the IRB itself may specify what information it wishes to be included in these reports. Because FDA does require the information listed below, it is suggested that, at a minimum, the annual progress and final reports to the sponsor and the IRB also include the following items:\n\na. IDE number\n\nb. Device name\n\nc. Indications for use\n\nd. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan\n\ne. Number of investigators and investigational sites\n\nf. Number of subjects enrolled\n\ng. Number of devices received, used, and the final disposition of unused devices\n\nh. Brief summary of results and conclusions\n\ni.

Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA also recommends that the IRB notify the sponsor of any instance of serious or continuing non-compliance with FDA regulations or IRB requirements or determinations, and any suspension or termination of IRB approval. Among the general responsibilities of sponsors is the assurance of proper monitoring of the investigation (21 CFR 312.50 and 21 CFR 812.40) and the selection of qualified investigators (21 CFR 312.53(a) and 21 CFR 812.43(a)). Informing sponsors of investigator non-compliance or IRB suspension or termination of the study allows the sponsor the opportunity to address these concerns. For example, the sponsor could work with the investigator to transfer subjects to another site in the local area, find a replacement investigator at the current site, or ensure that the study is terminated in an orderly manner.\n\n2.2.2 Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval\n\nThe IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate approval of clinical investigations:\n\nthat are not conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements (21 CFR 56.113); or\n\nthat are associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects (21 CFR 56.113).\n\nSuspension of approval may be appropriate when a significant issue is first identified and while the IRB investigates the matter. For example, if there is an allegation of investigator misconduct or a safety issue that needs further investigation and evaluation, the IRB may decide to suspend the study until the matter is resolved. In addition, the IRB may determine whether it is appropriate to notify subjects, and if so, when, given that complete information may not be available when the IRB first becomes aware of the issue.\n\nFor multi-site studies in which a local IRB is responsible for review of research at a given site, the local IRB's decision to suspend or terminate its approval of the research only applies to the conduct of the research project at the site under its review. On the other hand, if many or all sites engaged in a multi-site study rely upon a central IRB for review of the research, the central IRB could suspend or terminate its approval of the research either at one site because of a problem regarding the conduct of the research at that site, or at all sites under its review because of a study-wide problem. If an IRB (whose authority is only over a single site) believes the problem it found may be present at other sites, the IRB should inform FDA of its concern in the suspension or termination notification.\n\nAny suspension or termination of IRB approval must include the reasons for the IRB's actions and be promptly reported to the clinical investigator, institutional officials, and the FDA (21 CFR 56.113). IRBs must follow written procedures for ensuring such reporting (21 CFR 56.108(b)(3)).\n\nWhen reporting suspensions or terminations of IRB approval to FDA, IRBs should include:\n\nthe name of the drug, biologic, or device;the IND number; or the IDE number/non-significant risk (NSR) status of the device;\n\nthe full name of the research protocol;\n\nthe name(s) and address(es) of the clinical investigator(s);\n\nthe reason(s) for the suspension or termination; and\n\ninformation about the IRB's investigation and action plan to prevent/address future non-compliance.\n\nIRBs that have concerns about suspension or termination of approval of studies may contact FDA at any time to discuss these issues.27\n\nFootnote 27: See http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/ucm134493.htm\n\nWhen a study is suspended or terminated by the IRB, the IRB should consider the need to inform current or previously enrolled study subjects, as appropriate, about the action. In addition, an IRB should have established procedures to ensure that the rights and welfare of currently enrolled subjects are protected, subjects are not put at risk, and subjects receive appropriate care, if indicated, should the IRB (a) suspend or terminate its approval during the period for which IRB approval had already been given, or (b) disapprove a study at the time of continuing review. For example, the IRB, in consultation with the investigator and the subjects' treating physicians (if different from the investigator), may need to determine whether it is in the best interests of currently enrolled subjects to (a) continue receiving the interventions that were being administered to subjects under the study at the present site, (b) be transferred to another study-site so that participation of the subjects in the study may continue, or (c) be transitioned to medical management outside of the research context. Continuation of subjects on the test article may be appropriate, for example, when the test article holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the study subjects or when withholding the test article poses increased risk to study subjects. If the IRB decides that enrolled subjects should continue to receive the test article, it should also ensure that data collection (especially safety information) continues for such subjects. If follow-up of currently enrolled subjects is necessary to ensure their rights, safety or welfare, the IRB should ensure that the investigators inform the subjects, and report any unanticipated problems to the IRB, the sponsor, and the FDA (see 21 CFR 56.108(b)).\n\nAppendix\n\nCATEGORIES OF RESEARCH THAT MAY BE REVIEWED BY THE INSTITITUDINAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) THROUGH AN EXPEDITION REVIEW PROCEDURE({}^{\\lx@sectionsign})1\n\nFootnote 1: An expedited review procedure consists of a review of research involving human subjects by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB in accordance with the requirements set forth in 45 CFR 46.110.\n\n[Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216)] [Notices] [Page 60353-60356]*\n\nFootnote *: The list may be viewed online via GPO Access at http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dhname=1998 register&docid=98-29748-filed.pdf\n\nThe list that is referenced in Sec. 56.110(a) was originally published in the Federal Register of January 27, 1981 (46 FR 8980), as a notice of a list of research activities that could be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedures set forth in the FDA's regulations. OPRR has a separate codification that references the Expedited Review List for matters under the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) jurisdiction (45 CFR part 46). The HHS list was published in the Federal Register on January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8392). The FDA and HHS lists published in 1981 differ slightly, in that item nine on the HHS list, concerning research on individual or group behavior, pertains only to 45 CFR 46.110. Because behavioral research is not specifically regulated by FDA, that category was not included in the list published by FDA.\n\nApplicability\n\n(A) Research activities that (1) present no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures listed in one or more of the following categories, may be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedure authorized by 45 CFR 46.110 and 21 CFR 56.110. The activities listed should not be deemed to be of minimal risk simply because they are included on this list. Inclusion on this list merely means that the activity is eligible for review through the expedited review procedure when the specific circumstances of the proposed research involve no more than minimal risk to human subjects. (B) The categories in this list apply regardless of the age of subjects, except as noted. (C) The expedited review procedure may not be used where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place them at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (D) The expedited review procedure may not be used for classified research involving human subjects.

Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: *Q: May a clinical investigator rely on the information he/she provided to comply with his/her institution's policies and procedures pertaining to financial conflicts of interest to comply with the investigator obligations for financial disclosure under FDA's regulations?\n\nThe financial information a clinical investigator provides to his/her institution is based on the institution's requirements, which may not be sufficient to meet FDA's regulations. FDA's regulations require the clinical investigator to provide sufficient and accurate financial information to the sponsor to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements under FDA's clinical investigator financial disclosure regulations (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)). However, if an investigator determines that the financial information he/she provided to his/her institution adequately fulfills the disclosure requirements in FDA's regulations, a clinical investigator could provide the same information to the sponsor. The clinical investigator would still need to commit to promptly updating the financial information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)).\n\n*Q: How does the definition of \"sponsor\" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND/IDE regulations (21 CFR parts 312 and 812)?\n\nIn 21 CFR part 54, the term \"sponsor of the covered clinical study\" means \"the party supporting a particular study at the time it was carried out\" (21 CFR SSS 54.2(h)). FDA interprets \"support\" to include those who provide material support, for example, monetary support or the test product under study. (See Question E.9 for further explanation of \"material support.\") This differs from the meaning of \"sponsor\" in other FDA regulations (such as 21 CFR parts 312 and 812), where the sponsor may be the\nperson who initiates or takes responsibility for a clinical investigation (21 CFR SSS 312.3(b) and 812.3(n)). While the definition of sponsor under part 54 usually would include the sponsor of an IND/IDE (as defined in 21 CFR parts 312 and 812), it also includes any other individuals who provide material support for the study. Therefore, a covered clinical study may have more than one sponsor for financial disclosure purposes. When there is more than one sponsor, FDA interprets the regulation to mean that the dollar amounts triggering reporting apply separately to each sponsor.\n\nQ: What obligations do IND and IDE sponsors have regarding information collection prior to study start?\n\nA:: The IND and IDE regulations provide that, before permitting an investigator to begin participation in an investigation, the IND/IDE sponsor (that is, the sponsor as defined in 21 CFR parts 312 and 812) must obtain sufficient and accurate financial information that will allow an applicant to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements as required under 21 CFR part 54 (21 CFR SSS 312.53 and 812.43). In order to fulfill these requirements and ensure complete disclosure, the IND/IDE sponsor should identify all \"sponsors of the covered clinical study\" (as defined in 21 CFR SSS 54.2(h)) for investigators because the identity of all parties providing support may not be known to investigators.\n\nThe sponsor is also required to obtain the investigator's commitment to promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following the completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 312.53 and 812.43). By collecting the information prior to the study start, the sponsor will be aware of any potential problems, can consult with the agency early on, and can take steps to minimize any possibility for bias.\n\nQ: Why is the IND/IDE sponsor responsible for obtaining financial information from investigators?\n\nA:: Although reporting to the FDA is the responsibility of the applicant, the IND/IDE sponsor is required to collect the financial information before permitting an investigator to participate in a clinical study (21 CFR SSS 312.53, 812.20(b)(5), and 812.43). The purpose of this requirement is twofold:\n\nto alert the IND/IDE sponsor of the study of any potentially problematic financial interests or arrangements as early in the product development process as possible in order to minimize the potential for study bias, and\n\nto facilitate the accurate collection of financial information that may not be submitted until several years later.\n\nThe IND/IDE sponsor, who is in contact with the investigator, is best placed to inquire as to the financial interests and arrangements of investigators, and this obligation applies to any IND/IDE sponsor (e.g., commercial, government, or contract research organization (CRO)). The IND/IDE sponsor is required to maintain complete and accurate records showing any financial interest in, or arrangement with, a sponsor of the covered study, as described in 21 CFR SS 54.4(a)(3)(i-iv) (21 CFR SSS 312.57(b) and 812.140(b)(3)). The IND/IDE sponsor is also best situated to ensure that required financial information is collected and made available to the applicant company, so that the information can be included in the marketing application. (Refer to 21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53, 312.57(b), 812.43, and 812.140(b)(3).) IND/IDE sponsors conducting covered clinical studies outside the United States should note that the part 54 regulations do not distinguish between foreign and domestic sites. See Question F.3 for additional information.\n\nIs the IND/IDE sponsor responsible for obtaining 1-year follow-up financial information from clinical investigators?\n\nA:: As noted in response to Question E.2 above, the IND/IDE sponsor is required to obtain financial information from clinical investigators before permitting the investigators to begin participation in an investigation and to obtain the investigator's commitment to promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the study and for one year following the completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 312.52 and 812.43). The regulations do not specifically require the IND/IDE sponsor to obtain information from clinical investigators one year following completion of the study. The regulations, however, do require IND/IDE sponsors to maintain complete and accurate records concerning all financial interests and arrangements of clinical investigators subject to part 54 (see 21 CFR SSS 312.57(b) and 812.140(b)(3)) and to secure investigator compliance with the regulations (see 21 CFR SSS 312.56(b) and 812.46(a)). Therefore, an IND/IDE sponsor should take steps to ensure clinical investigator compliance, such as reminding the clinical investigators of the requirement to promptly update their financial information when any relevant changes occur during the study and for one year following completion.\n\nQ: What if the IND/IDE sponsor is not the party who will be submitting a marketing application?\n\nA:: In many cases, the IND/IDE sponsor, the part 54 sponsor, and the applicant will be the same party. However, there may be times when they are not. For example, consider the case when an academic institution serves as the IND/IDE sponsor and a drug company serves as the part 54 sponsor by providing funding or the investigational drug for the study. When a marketing application is submitted, the drug company is likely to be the applicant. If, however, the drug company was sold to another company, the applicant may be neither the IND/IDE sponsor nor a part 54 sponsor.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that even if the IND/IDE sponsor will not be submitting the marketing application, the IND/IDE sponsor is still responsible for collecting financial information from the clinical investigators. The responsibility for reporting financial information to FDA falls upon the applicant; that is, part 54 requires the applicant to submit financial information when the marketing application is submitted to FDA (21 CFR SS 54.4(a)). As stated above and in Question E.3, an IND/IDE sponsor is responsible for collecting financial information from both foreign and domestic clinical investigators. If a sponsor did not collect this information, for example, because the sponsor conducted a foreign study that was not conducted under an IND/IDE and was not originally intended for submission to the FDA, the applicant is expected to contact the sponsor and/or clinical investigators to retrospectively obtain the financial disclosure information. See Questions F.2 and F.3 for additional information.\n\nQ: If a contract research organization (CRO) is conducting a covered clinical study on behalf of another company, should the CRO collect the financial information from investigators? Is it necessary to collect financial information from investigators who have financial interests in or arrangements with CROs?\n\nA:: If a CRO meets the definition of an IND/IDE sponsor or has contracted to collect financial information from clinical investigators on behalf of a sponsor, the CRO must collect financial information on clinical investigators' interests in any sponsors of the covered clinical study. See 21 CFR SS 312.52. To satisfy the requirements in part 54, if the CRO provides material support for a covered study, financial information on clinical investigators' financial interests in and arrangements with the CRO is to be collected. If another entity provided material support for the study, and the CRO was responsible for collecting the information, then the CRO also would collect financial information relative to that entity.\n\nQ: Suppose a public or academic institution conducts a covered clinical study without any support from a commercial sponsor, but the study is later used by an applicant to support its marketing application. In that case, who is the \"sponsor\" of the study and what information should the applicant submit?\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.613344669342041"], "Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nChanges to an Approved\n\nNDA or ANDA\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nJanuary 2001\n\nCMC\n\nChapter 6 Outdance for Industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Questions and Answers\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Communications Management\n\nDrug Information Branch, HFD-210\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\n(Internet)  http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nJanuary 2001\n\nCMCTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls committee (CMCCC) in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nChanges to an Approved NDA or ANDA\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administrations current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nReporting Categories\n\nQ1: For a change that is reported in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days, will CDER complete the review of the supplement within 30 Days?\n\nWithin 30 days CDER will notify the applicant that prior approval is required for the change (i.e., CDER has designated the supplement a prior approval supplement) or that the FDA has determined appropriate information is missing, including information that should have been developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change. Supplement reviews will be performed consistent with standard procedures. It is unlikely that a substantive review and action letter will be completed within 30 days.\n\nQ2:: If information is missing from a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days, will the reporting category be changed to a prior approval supplement?\n\nNo. If FDA informs the applicent within 30 days of receipt of the Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days that information is missing, the reporting category is not changed to a prior approval supplement. However, distribution of the product made with the change must be delayed until the supplement is amended with the missing information.\n\nA change (specified change) is planned. The guidance recommends that the change be reported in a supplemental application. However, the data generated indicate that this change does not adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product. Can this change be reported in an annual report?\n\nNo. The recommended reporting category is based on the potential for the change to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product (see section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act)). CDER expects that the majority of the data and information submitted to support a supplemental change will, in the applicent's judgment, demonstrate that the change does not adversely affect the product. However, FDA will evaluate the completeness of the data and information and decide whether the applicent's conclusion (i.e., there is no adverse effect) is appropriate prior to approving such a change.\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\nA manufacturing change is planned that can be reported in the annual report. Should the data to support the change be included in the annual report?\n\nYes. After the change is implemented, the information should be included in the next annual report. Moreover, the information to support the change must be generated prior to distributing the product made with the change (506A(b)). As stated in section 506A(b) of the Act, \"a drug made with a manufacturing change (whether a major manufacturing change or otherwise) may be distributed only if, before distribution of the drug as so made, the holder involved validated the effects of the change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug as the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\"\n\nManufacturing Sites\n\n_Can a change in the manufacturing site for a drug substance that involves a different company (i.e., change in source) be reported in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days?_A1: As stated in section VI.A of the guidance, \"A move to a different manufacturing site that involves other changes (e.g., process, equipment) should be evaluated as a multiple related change (see section XII) to determine the appropriate reporting category.\" Typically, a change from one drug substance manufacturer to another involves more than simply a site change. In most cases, there will be additional differences (e.g., route of synthesis, process, solvents, equipment). Without extensive knowledge of the new and old sources (e.g., access to the drug master file), an applicant cannot adequately describe the differences between the sources or evaluate the multiple change. Therefore, when the applicant does not have extensive knowledge to provide the information and evaluation, the drug substance site change should be reported in a prior approval supplement. When an applicant has the extensive knowledge to describe the differences between the sources, the applicant can report the change as appropriate after evaluation as a multiple change. If the change is not reported in a prior approval supplement, the applicant should include a statement in the submission that the change involves no changes that should be reported in a prior approval supplement. In either case, a move to a drug substance manufacturing site should be reported in a prior approval supplement when the site does not have a satisfactory current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)) inspection (see guidance for details) for the type of operation.\n\nQ2: Should a change to a different site be reported when the change is for fabrication of packaging components?\n\nA2: Section VI.A of the guidance identifies the site changes that should be reported to CDER. A move to a different site to manufacture or process drug products should be reported. The guidance defines sites used to manufacture or process drug products to include sites used by the applicant (applicant owned or contractors) to prepare (e.g., sterilize, depyrogenate, irradiate, wash) container closure systems or packaging components. A change to a different site for fabricating packaging components (e.g., bottles) or manufacturing packaging materials (e.g., resins) need not be reported if there is no other change (e.g., dimensions, composition, specification, processing aids). If other changes occur, the reporting category should be based on the recommended reporting categories for the changes (i.e., the manufacturing site change should not be considered when determining the appropriate reporting category).\n\nQ3: The guidance states that a move to a different site that results in a restart at the new manufacturing site of a type of operation that has been discontinued for more than two years should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VI.B.1). Two manufacturing sites were approved in the original application. Production at one of the sites has not occurred in 5 years but is going to be restarted. Should this restart be reported in a prior approval supplement?_\n\nA3: A restart of manufacturing at a site already approved in the application need not be reported in the application as long as the restart does not involve any other changes(e.g., equipment, process) that should be reported. If the restart involves a site that is not approved in the application, a prior approval supplement should be submitted.\n\nQ4:: A packaging site will be added that will enclose two sample cartons, along with some promotional material, into a larger carton or box preprinted with the product name:\n\nDoes the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n\nIs the tertiary site held to the same CGMP requirements as a secondary site? For example, if a tertiary site should be submitted to the agency, and this site has not had any CGMP inspection within the last two years, is this change still annual reportable?\n\nA4: The guidance only distinguishes between primary and secondary packaging sites. The site described would be considered a secondary packaging site. CGMP requirements extend beyond packaging and repackaging operations that involve direct product contact. For example, a site must register with FDA (21 CFR Part 207) and is subject to CGMP inspection (21 CFR Part 211) when the site is used to attach inserts, or in the case of a cartoning site, when cartons contain product labels. If registration and/or inspection are required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, CDER should be notified of the different site (via the application). The site should have a satisfactory inspection relating to packaging operations for notification to occur in the annual report. For the purposes of this guidance, in general, there is no two-year limit on the CGMP inspection (see Manufacturing Sites Q10). If registration and inspection are not required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, the applicant need not notify CDER of the site. If you have any questions on whether this packaging operation is subject to FDA registration or inspection, you should contact the appropriate CDER inspection and/or compliance staff for advice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.8436152935028076", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 5: Internal Agency policies and procedures relating to processing requests for expedited review of supplements to approved ANDAs and NDAs are documented in CDER\u2019s Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) at 5240.1 and 5310.3, respectively. MAPPs can be located on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/mapp.htm.\n\nA moderate change is a change that has a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. There are two types of moderate change. One type of moderate change requires the submission of a supplement to FDA at least 30 days before the distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Supplement - Changes Being Effected in 30 Days ($ 314.70(c)(3)). The drug product made using a moderate change cannot be distributed if FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that a prior approval supplement is required ($ 314.70(c)(5)(i)). For each change, the supplement must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and must include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change ($ 314.70(a)(2) and (c)(4)). If FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that information is missing, distribution must be delayed until the supplement has been amended to provide the missing information ($ 314.70(c)(5)(ii)).\n\nFDA may identify certain moderate changes for which distribution can occur when FDA receives the supplement ($ 314.70(c)(6)). This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Supplement - Changes Being Effected. If, after review, FDA disapproves a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement or changes-being-effected supplement, FDA may order the manufacturer to cease distribution of the drug products made using the disapproved change ($ 314.70(c)(7)).\n\nA minor change is a change that has minimal potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. The applicant must describe minor changes in its next Annual Report ($ 314.70(d)).\n\nUnder $ 314.70(e), an applicant can submit one or more protocols (i.e., comparability protocols) describing tests, studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the absence of an adverse effect from specified types of changes. A comparability protocol can be used to reduce the reporting category for specified changes. A proposed comparability protocol that was not approved as part of the original application must be submitted as a prior approval supplement (314.70(e)). On February 25, 2003, FDA issued a draft guidance on comparability protocols entitled Comparability protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nIII General Requirements\n\nOther than for editorial changes in previously submitted information (e.g., correction of spelling or typographical errors, reformatting of batch records), an applicant must notify FDA about each change in each condition established in an approved application beyond the variations already provided for in the application ($ 314.70(a)(1)).\n\nA supplement or annual report must include a list of all changes contained in the supplement or annual report. On the list, FDA recommends that the applicant describe each change in enough detail to allow FDA to quickly determine whether the appropriate reporting category has been used. For supplements, this list must be provided in the cover letter ($ 314.70(a)(6)). In annual reports, the list should be included in the summary section ($ 314.81(b)(2)(i)). The applicant must describe each change fully in the supplement or annual report ($ 314.70(a)(1)).\n\nAn applicant making a change to an approved application under section 506A of the Act must also conform to other applicable laws and regulations, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)) and applicable regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 21 CFR parts 210, 211, 314). For example, manufacturers must comply with relevant CGMP validation and recordkeeping requirements and ensure that relevant records are readily available for examination by authorized FDA personnel during an inspection.\n\nA changes-being-effected supplement providing for labeling changes under $ 314.70(c)(6)(iii) must include 12 copies of the final printed labeling ($ 314.70(c)(1)). In accordance with Contains Nonbinding Recommendations*\n\n$ 314.70(a)(4), an applicant also must promptly revise all promotional labeling and drug advertising to make it consistent with any labeling change implemented in accordance with $ 314.70(b) or (c).\n\nExcept for supplements providing only for a change in labeling, an applicant must include in each supplement and amendment to a supplement a statement certifying that a field copy has been provided in accordance with 21 CFR 314.440(a)(4)6 ($ 314.70(a)(5)).\n\nFootnote 6: Mailing information for field copies is provided in 21 CFR 314.440(a)(4). FDA recommends that the applicant\u2019s home FDA district office referred to in the regulations be the district office where the applicant\u2019s headquarters is located.\n\nIV Assessing the Effect of Manufacturing Changes\n\nAssessment of the Effects of the Change\n\nThe holder of an approved application under section 505 of the Act must assess the effects of the change before distributing a drug product made with a manufacturing change ($ 314.70(a)(2)).7 For each change, the supplement or annual report must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and must include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change (section 506A(b), (c)(1), (d)(2)(A), and (d)(3)(A) of the Act). The type of information that must be included in a supplemental application or an annual report is specified in $ 314.70(b)(3), (c)(4), and (d)(3).\n\nFootnote 7: Assess the effects of the change means to evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a drug product as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. The terms assess or assessment as used in this guidance are not the same as validation. Certain validation information, such as for sterilization processes, is considered information that is needed to assess the effect of the change as specified in $ 314.70(a)(2) and should be submitted in an NDA or ANDA. Unless otherwise specified by FDA, validation (e.g., process, equipment) data need not be submitted in the application, but should be retained at the facility and be available for review by FDA at the Agency\u2019s discretion under CGMPs.\n\n1.1 Conformance to Specifications\n\nAn assessment of the effects of a change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug product should include a determination that the drug substance intermediates, drug substance, in-process materials, and/or drug product affected by the change conform to the approved specifications.8 A specification is a quality standard (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drug substances, drug products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug substance or drug product. Acceptance criteria are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described ($ 314.3(b)). Conformance to a specification means that the material, when tested according to the analytical procedures listed in the specification, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.\n\n2.2.2 Additional Testing\n\nIn addition to confirming that the material affected by manufacturing changes continues to meet its specification, we recommend that the applicant perform additional testing, when appropriate, to assess whether the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product have been or will be affected. The assessment should include, as appropriate, evaluation of any changes in the chemical, physical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and/or stability profiles. This additional assessment could involve testing of the postchange drug product itself or, if appropriate, the material directly affected by the change. The type of additional testing that an applicant should perform would depend on the type of manufacturing change, the type of drug substance and/or drug product, and the effect of the change on the quality of the drug product. For example:\n\nEvaluation of changes in the impurity or degradant profile could first involve profiling using appropriate chromatographic techniques and then, depending on the observed changes in the impurity profile, toxicology tests to qualify a new impurity or degradant or to qualify an impurity that is above a previously qualified level.9 Footnote 9: Recommendations on identifying, qualifying, and reporting impurities can be found in relevant guidances (e.g., ICH Q3B Impurities in New Drug Products (November 1996)).\n\nEvaluation of the hardness or friability of a tablet after certain changes.\n\nAssessment of the effect of a change on bioequivalence when required under 21 CFR part 320 could include, for example, multipoint and/or multimedia dissolution profiling and/or an in vivo bioequivalence study.\n\nEvaluation of extractables from new packaging components or moisture permeability of a new container closure system.\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.668027639389038", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Significantly altering the intended patient population\n\nProviding for, or providing evidence of effectiveness necessary for, the traditional approval of a product originally approved under subpart H of part 314 or part 601\n\nIncorporating other information based on at least one adequate and well-controlled clinical study\n\nPediatric supplements in response to written requests and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) of 200712 Footnote 12: Section 505A and 505B of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (P. L. 110-85)\n\nExamples of supplements that do not trigger the requirements to revise labeling to the PLR format include NDA supplements for a new tablet strength; supplements that provide bioequivalence information, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, also known as a \"CMC\" supplement, including one that contains clinical data but for which the data do not affect labeling (e.g., reformulation); and supplements that add new risk information (e.g., a new contraindication, warning).\n\niv.2.2 Approved Applications\n\nThe timing for submitting labeling in the PLR format is based on the implementation plan (see SS 201.56(c) and Appendix A), but an applicant can voluntarily convert product labeling to the PLR format before the date specified in the implementation plan and is encouraged to do so. When more than one approval for the same product occurred in the 5 years prior to the effective date of the final rule (e.g., NDA and efficacy supplement), the date of the most recent approval determines the timing of submission of labeling in the PLR format according to the implementation plan.\n\nThe labeling must be submitted as a prior approval labeling supplement.13 After labeling is approved in the PLR format, any subsequent changes to Highlights, other than identified minor exceptions, require submission of a prior approval supplement (SSSS 314.70(b), (c), and (d) and 601.12(f)).\n\nFootnote 13: See \u00a7\u00a7 314.70(b) and 601.12(f) about supplements requiring FDA approval before the change is made.\n\niv.2.3 Submitting Draft Labeling to FDA for Review\n\nTo facilitate FDA's review of labeling, when a significant amount of new information is being added to the labeling at the same time that the labeling is being converted to the PLR format (e.g., an efficacy supplement that also converts labeling to the PLR format), we recommend that the following versions of labeling be submitted as appropriate:\n\nLabeling in the old format\n\nAnnotated labeling in the old format explaining how existing text was incorporated into the PLR format\n\nA clean version (no redline/strikeout) in the PLR format without the new information\n\nThe above clean version in the PLR format with the new information (in redline/strikeout)\n\nFor the example listed above, if the efficacy supplement is to be reviewed in a division other than the one that managed the original application, two supplements should be submitted (i.e., a labeling supplement and an efficacy supplement).\n\nApplicants should explain significant or notable changes in wording or content, or relocation of information to a different section, and how the decisions to make those changes were made. For submissions covering only a conversion of existing labeling to PLR format (without adding new information), the applicant should mark clearly on the cover letter, Labeling/PLR Conversion to facilitate identification of the type of submission for FDA.\n\nChanges to the Regulations for Applications Not Covered by the Final Rule\n\nFDA has also made minor amendments to the labeling regulations for prescription drug and biological products not subject to the PLR content and format requirements (see SSSS 201.56(e) and 201.80). Section 201.80 remains largely unchanged from previous labeling regulations, except for minor revisions to the REFERENCES section and the requirement to append FDA-approved patient labeling to the prescribing information by June 30, 2007. As always, labeling must be informative and accurate and neither promotional in tone nor false or misleading in any particular (SS 201.56(a)(3)). Therefore, the applicant should review the labeling at least annually for outdated information. Removing outdated references could be submitted in the Annual Report.\n\nAppending FDA-Approved Patient Labeling\n\nThe final rule required that by June 30, 2007, any FDA-approved patient labeling either accompany the labeling or be reprinted immediately following the last section of the labeling (SSSS 201.56(e)(6), 201.57(c)(18) and 201.80(f)(2)).14 This requirement applies to the labeling of all drugs, not just those subject to the PLR format requirements. The final rule provides the option of either reprinting the FDA-approved patient labeling (including Medication Guides) immediately following the last section of labeling or having the FDA-approved patient labeling accompany the labeling as a separate document (e.g., included in the carton with the drug).\n\n4.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn addition, any FDA-approved patient labeling must be referenced in the PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION section (SS 201.57(c)(18) in the PLR format or in the Information for Patients subsection (SS 201.80(f)(2) in the old format). A statement referring the reader to FDA-approved patient labeling should appear at the beginning of the section or subsection.\n\nThe FDA-approved patient labeling should not be a numbered subsection under the PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION section in the FPI or listed in Contents, but appended or reprinted after the last section of labeling.\n\nIncluding only the FDA-approved patient labeling as the content of the PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION section does not meet the requirements of the final rule (SSSS 201.57(c)(18) and 201.80(f)(2)). FDA-approved patient labeling and the information in the PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION section have distinct purposes. The PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION section of the FPI is written for health care professionals and contains the information that is important to convey to patients when the drug is being prescribed, dispensed, or administered. The FDA-approved patient labeling is written for patients to provide them with information about the drug that has been prescribed. FDA believes that both of these are important tools for providing information to patients.\n\nSubmitting Electronic Versions of Labeling\n\nFor information about submitting labeling electronically, applicants should consult the information and guidances for industry on FDA's web site on Structured Product Labeling Resources.15\n\nFootnote 15: http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/default.htm.\n\nWaivers and CBE Supplements\n\nWaivers: Requests to waive a labeling requirement under SSS 314.90(a) or 201.58 should be submitted directly to the application with any related communication directed to the responsible review division. A waiver request may pertain to a labeling requirement described in SSS 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, or 314.50(l)(i). The applicant should clearly identify the submission as a request for a waiver.\n\nWaivers of the one-half page Highlights requirement: The PLR regulations require that Highlights, excluding the boxed warning, be limited in length to one-half page (SS 201.57(d)(8)). Applicants should strive for this one-half page limit, using recommendations included in this guidance (e.g., avoiding redundancy of information, use of directive language, and inclusion of succinct bulleted lists). However, FDA recognizes that under certain circumstances, particularly when a product has many indications or many serious warnings and precautions that merit inclusion in Highlights, it may not be possible to accommodate all the required information within one-half page. In this case, the applicantcan submit a waiver request with the submission (e.g., NDA, BLA, efficacy supplement, or labeling supplement) (see SS 201.58.). The applicant should prominently identify the submission as one that includes a waiver request. In the waiver request, the applicant should explain why the one-half page requirement cannot be met. FDA will discuss the waiver request with the applicant during the review process and will formally document its decision in an action letter to the applicant.\n\nChanges to Highlights through a CBE supplement: With minor exceptions, changes to Highlights require a prior approval supplement (SSSS 314.70 and 601.12). If the labeling is already approved in the PLR format and the proposed change(s) qualify for a CBE supplement under SSS 314.70(c) and 601.12(f), a prior approval supplement is not needed as long as the change does not warrant inclusion in Highlights (e.g., addition of an adverse reaction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section in the FPI). If, in the opinion of the applicant, the new information warrants inclusion in Highlights or will be listed under Recent Major Changes in Highlights (i.e., a change to the BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, OR WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS sections), the applicant should notify the appropriate review division about the proposed change to the labeling. The review division may permit changes to Highlights through a CBE supplement after consideration of the new information.\n\nClass Labeling\n\n1.1.1 Mandated Statements\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products - Implementing the PLR Content and Format Requirements \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.625524520874023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: iv.2.2 Frequency and Number of Runs\n\nWhen a processing line is initially qualified, individual media fills should be repeated enough times to ensure that results are consistent and meaningful. This approach is important because a single run can be inconclusive, while multiple runs with divergent results signal a process that is not in control. We recommend that at least three consecutive separate successful runs be performed during initial line qualification. Subsequently, routine semi-annual qualification conducted for each processing line will evaluate the state of control of the aseptic process. Activities and interventions representative of each shift, and shift changeover, should be incorporated into the design of the semi-annual qualification program. For example, the evaluation of a production shift should address its unique time-related and operational features.13 All personnel who are authorized to enter the aseptic processing room during manufacturing, including technicians and maintenance personnel, should participate in a media fill at least once a year. Participation should be consistent with the nature of each operator's duties during routine production.\n\nFootnote 13: One example might be the movement of personnel into and out of the aseptic processing and gowning change rooms during a shift change.\n\nEach change to a product or line change should be evaluated using a written change control system. Any changes or events that have the potential to affect the ability of the aseptic process to exclude contamination from the sterilized product should be assessed through additional media fills. For example, facility and equipment modifications, line configuration changes, significant changes in personnel, anomalies in environmental testing results, container closure system changes, extended shutdowns, or end product sterility testing showing contaminated products may be cause for revalidation of the system.\n\nWhen data from a media fill indicate the process may not be in control, an investigation should be conducted to determine the origin of the contamination and the scope of the problem. Once corrections are instituted, process simulation run(s) should be performed to confirm that deficiencies have been corrected and the process has returned to a state of control. When an investigation fails to reach well-supported, substantive conclusions as to the cause of the media fill failure, three consecutive successful runs in tandem with increased scrutiny of the production process may be warranted.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:27]\n\nmanual manipulation. Use of slow line speed is generally appropriate for evaluating manufacturing processes with prolonged exposure of the sterile drug product and containers/closures in the aseptic area.\n\n6.2.6 Environmental Conditions\n\nMedia fills should be adequately representative of the conditions under which actual manufacturing operations are conducted. An inaccurate assessment (making the process appear cleaner than it actually is) can result from conducting a media fill under extraordinary air particulate and microbial quality, or under production controls and precautions taken in preparation for the media fill. To the extent standard operating procedures permit stressful conditions (e.g., maximum number of personnel present and elevated activity level), it is important that media fills include analogous challenges to support the validity of these studies. Stressful conditions do not include artificially created environmental extremes, such as reconfiguration of HVAC systems to operate at worst-case limits.\n\n6.2.7 Media\n\nIn general, a microbiological growth medium, such as soybean casein digest medium, should be used. Use of anaerobic growth media (e.g., fluid thioglycollate medium) should be considered in special circumstances. The media selected should be demonstrated to promote growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and yeast and mold (e.g., USP indicator organisms). The QC laboratory should determine if USP indicator organisms sufficiently represent production-related isolates. Environmental monitoring and sterility test isolates can be substituted (as appropriate) or added to the growth promotion challenge. Growth promotion units should be inoculated with a (<)100 CFU challenge. If the growth promotion testing fails, the origin of any contamination found during the simulation should nonetheless be investigated and the media fill promptly repeated.14\n\nFootnote 14: The cause of the growth promotion failure should also be investigated.\n\nThe production process should be accurately simulated using media and conditions that optimize detection of any microbiological contamination. Each unit should be filled with an appropriate quantity and type of microbial growth medium to contact the inner container closure surfaces (when the unit is inverted or thoroughly swirled) and permit visual detection of microbial growth.\n\nSome drug manufacturers have expressed concern over the possible contamination of the facility and equipment with nutrient media during media fill runs. However, if the medium is handled properly and is promptly followed by the cleaning, sanitizing, and, where necessary, sterilization of equipment, subsequently processed products are not likely to be compromised.\n\n6.2.8 Incubation and Examination of Media-Filled Units\n\nMedia units should be incubated under conditions adequate to detect microorganisms that might otherwise be difficult to culture. Incubation conditions should be established in accord with the following general guidelines:* Incubation temperature should be suitable for recovery of bioburden and environmental isolates and should at no time be outside the range of 20-35({}^{\\circ})C. Incubation temperature should be maintained within (\\pm 2.5^{\\circ})C of the target temperature.\n* Incubation time should not be less than 14 days. If two temperatures are used for the incubation of the media filled units, the units should be incubated for at least 7 days at each temperature (starting with the lower temperature).\n\nEach media-filled unit should be examined for contamination by personnel with appropriate education, training, and experience in inspecting media fill units for microbiological contamination. If QC personnel do not perform the inspection, there should be QC unit oversight throughout any such examination. All suspect units identified during the examination should be brought to the immediate attention of the QC microbiologist. To allow for visual detection of microbial growth, we recommend substituting clear containers (with otherwise identical physical properties) for amber or other opaque containers. If appropriate, other methods can also be considered to ensure visual detection.\n\nWhen a firm performs a final product inspection of units immediately following the media fill run, all integral units should proceed to incubation. Units found to have defects not related to integrity (e.g., cosmetic defect) should be incubated; units that lack integrity should be rejected. Erroneously rejected units should be returned promptly for incubation with the media fill lot.\n\nAfter incubation is underway, any unit found to be damaged should be included in the data for the media fill run, because the units can be representative of drug product released to the market. Any decision to exclude such incubated units (i.e., non-integral) from the final run tally should be fully justified and the deviation explained in the media fill report. If a correlation emerges between difficult to detect damage and microbial contamination, a thorough investigation should be conducted to determine its cause (see Section VI.B).\n\nWritten procedures regarding aseptic interventions should be clear and specific (e.g., intervention type; quantity of units removed), providing for consistent production practices and assessment of these practices during media fills. If written procedures and batch documentation are adequate to describe an associated clearance, the intervention units removed during media fills do not need to be incubated.15 Where procedures lack specificity, there would be insufficient justification for exclusion of units removed during an intervention from incubation. For example, if a production procedure requires removal of 10 units after an intervention at the stopping station infeed, batch records (i.e., for production and media fills) should clearly document conformance with this procedure. In no case should more units be removed during a media fill intervention than would be cleared during a production run.\n\nFootnote 15: To assess contamination risks during initial aseptic setup (before fill), valuable information can be obtained by incubating all such units that may be normally removed. These units are typically incubated separately, and would not necessarily be included in the acceptance criteria for the media fill.\n\nThe ability of a media fill run to detect potential contamination from a given simulated activity should not be compromised by a large-scale line clearance. We recommend incorporatingappropriate study provisions to avoid and address a large line clearance that results in the removal of a unit possibly contaminated during an unrelated event or intervention.\n\nAppropriate criteria should be established for yield16 and accountability (reconciliation of filled units). Media fill record reconciliation documentation should include a full accounting and description of units rejected from a batch.\n\nFootnote 16: Total units incubated/total number of units filled.\n\n9.1.9 Interpretation of Test Results\n\nThe process simulation run should be observed by the QC Unit, and contaminated units should be reconcilable with the approximate time and the activity being simulated during the media fill. Video recording of a media fill may serve as a useful aide in identifying personnel practices that could negatively affect the aseptic process.\n--------------------\nContext title: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing \u2014 Current Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.475037574768066", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Industry requested a detailed flowchart that would identify the type of supplement to be submitted based on any specific change for any device. FDA understands that there is a general desire among PMA applicants for such a detailed flowchart or easy-to-use paradigm. However, FDA believes the complexity and variability of class III devices makes it unfeasible to develop such a flowchart.\n\nIndustry requested specific definitions for some terms, such as \"substantial clinical data,\" \"significant change,\" and \"limited confirmatory clinical data.\" Where possible, FDA provided additional clarity for some terminology. Again, because of the complexity and variability of class III devices, we do not believe it is feasible to provide detailed definitions for certain terms and instead use examples to help illustrate the meaning of these terms.\n\nIndustry requested that the guidance address 30-day supplements (21 CFR 814.39(e)). However, FDA has chosen not to include 30-day supplements within the scope of the guidance document, in part, because we have not identified cases for which this provision can be effectively applied.\n\nIndustry requested the addition of examples to illustrate the various supplement types as well as periodic reports. While industry provided a number of examples, many such examples did not contain sufficient details for inclusion in this guidance document. However, examples that provided further clarification on the underlying principles were added. In addition, the periodic report section was significantly increased in detail and includes examples.\n\nIII General Requirements for When a PMA Supplement is Needed\n\nExamples of the types of modifications that require a PMA supplement (21 CFR 814.39(a)), if such changes affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nnew indications for use of the device;\n\nlabeling changes;\n\nthe use of a different facility or establishment to manufacture, process, or package the device;\n\nchanges in sterilization procedures;\n\nchanges in packaging;\n\nchanges in the performance or design specifications, circuits, components, ingredients, principle of operation, or physical layout of the device; and * extension of the expiration date of the device based on data obtained under a new or revised shelf life testing protocol that has not been approved by FDA. If FDA has approved your protocol, the change should be reported in a periodic report (21 CFR 814.39(b)).\n\nUnder 21 CFR 814.39(f), you may submit, instead of a PMA supplement, a 30-day notice for changes to manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacture that affect the safety and effectiveness of your device. We recommend that you carefully assess whether a PMA supplement (21 CFR 814.39(a)) or a 30-day notice (21 CFR 814.39(f)) is appropriate for any modification you plan to undertake. The Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) requires that you have in place a system to document and assess design changes (21 CFR 820.30). Part of the assessment for all changes should include a risk analysis and validation (or, where appropriate, verification) of the changes to the design or manufacturing process and subsequent assessment of the need for regulatory submission. (More information regarding 30-day notices is provided in Section F of this guidance document.)\n\nIV Determining the Type of PMA Submission\n\nA primary indicator of what type of PMA submission is needed is the nature of the data, if any, that is needed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the modified device. Each of the following sections describes one of the various types of PMA submissions that may be submitted to FDA (traditional PMA, a panel-track supplement, a 180-day supplement, a real-time supplement, a Special PMA Supplement - Changes Being Effected, 30-day notice, and manufacturing site change supplement). For each type of PMA submission, we discuss the kinds of changes we would consider to be appropriate for the type of submission, the general nature of test data we believe are needed to support the safety and effectiveness of such changes, and criteria we may use when determining whether that type of submission should be submitted.\n\nWe also provide, in each section, examples of device modifications submitted to CDRH/Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), CDRH/Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD), and CBER to illustrate what we believe are appropriate submissions for the type of PMA submission discussed in that section. For each example, we provide the specific changes that were made to the approved device, the impact that changes had on the intended patients or on the use of the device, and the test data that FDA believes are needed to demonstrate that the modified device remains safe and effective.\n\nThe examples below illustrate how FDA determines which particular supplement type is warranted. These examples are straightforward in nature to demonstrate the underlying principles. We expect that there may be more complex situations. If you need additional input from FDA to determine the appropriate supplement type, please contact the appropriate review branch or division.\n\nFigure 1 at the end of this guidance document illustrates the steps we recommend you follow in selecting the appropriate regulatory path for a modification to your PMA device.\n\nAppendix A When to Submit a Traditional PMA\n\nIn general, a traditional PMA (rather than a PMA supplement) is appropriate when the modifications you make to your approved PMA device result in a new device. We would consider a new device to be one where a modification results in a device design so different from the original version that the preclinical3 (\"analytical\" for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs)) and clinical data4 you previously submitted on your original device are not applicable (i.e., not supportive) for the specific change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the modified device.\n\nFootnote 3: For purposes of this guidance document, the term \u201cprecilical testing\u201d refers to non-clinical testing that is used to characterize a device (e.g., animal, bench, biocompatibility, electrical safety, software, reproducibility, reliability, accuracy, limit of detection, analytical testing).\n\nFootnote 4: For purposes of this guidance document, the term \u201cclinical data\u201d refers to data derived from a study using a patient population with a defined clinical condition to determine the safety and effectiveness of the device, including clinical performance characteristics (e.g., clinical specificity, clinical sensitivity). Clinical data are not limited to data obtained from an investigational device exemption (IDE) study and could include foreign data and literature.\n\nIn deciding whether to submit a supplement to your approved traditional PMA or to submit a new traditional PMA5 for a modified device, we recommend you first ascertain whether, and to what extent, you can rely on the preclinical testing and clinical data submitted in your traditional PMA to support the safety and effectiveness of your modified device. If you need to conduct both new preclinical testing and new clinical testing to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the modified device, you should assume that this is a new device that will require a submission of a new traditional PMA.6\n\nFootnote 5: In lieu of a traditional PMA, you may submit a modular PMA. The criteria and process for the modular review program are discussed in Premarket Approval Application Modular Review Program available at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/835.html.\n\nFootnote 6: For the purposes of this guidance document, new preclinical or clinical data are those collected in accordance with an existing or different protocol.\n\nThe examples below illustrate when FDA has considered a traditional PMA to be appropriate for a device modification based on the types of changes made and the testing that was necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Each example describes a device reviewed in ODE, unless indicated as reviewed in OIVD or CBER.\n\nAppendix A Modified Device for a New Indication for Use\n\nFDA approved a PMA for the TransMyocardial Revascularization (TMR) holmium laser for surgical treatment of stable patients with angina that is refractory to medical treatment and not amenable to direct coronary revascularization. In this procedure, the chest is opened by surgical incision. Once the heart is exposed, the surgeon places the end of a fiber light guide onto the surface of the epicardium and the laser is activated making a hole through the ventricular wall, penetrating entirely through the wall into the ventricular cavity. This is repeated at several locations in the region to be treated.\n\nThe PMA applicant modified its laser system by incorporating it into a fiber optic guide to make it suitable for percutaneous use. The PMA applicant also modified the indication for use toinclude percutaneous myocardial revascularization (PMR), a non-surgical procedure. In PMR, the surgeon percutaneously places a catheter containing a fiber optic light guide into the left ventricle and uses the laser to make several gouges in the endocardium (inside) ventricular wall.\n--------------------\nContext title: Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.28653621673584", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Decision: New 510(k).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:45]\n\n5. Change: The warning information in the labeling for an IVD is modified to account for recently revised hazardous material guidelines.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for usestatement? No. This not a change in the indications for use statement of the device.\n\nA3 - Is it a change in warnings or precautions? Yes. A change is made to a warning about hazardous materials. Proceed to A1.1-A1.5.\n\nA1.5 - Does a risk-based assessment of the changed device identify any new risks or significantly modified existing risks? No. So long as the same risks are communicated to the device user, this change would not significantly affect the device's risk profile.\n\nDecision: Documentation.\n\n6. Change: The manufacturer adds a foreign language translation of the directions for use to a device's labeling. The translation does not change the meaning of the instructions.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for usestatement? No. This is not a change in the indications for use statement of the device.\n\nA4 - Could the change affect the directions for use of the device? Yes. Proceed to A1.1-A1.5.\n\nA1.5 - Does a risk-based assessment of the changed device identify any new risks or significantly modified existing risks? No. As long as the translation does not change the meaning of the instructions, this change would not affect the device's risk profile.\n\nDecision: Documentation.\n\n7. Change: The directions for use of a catheter guidewire are modified to provide instructions on how to access different types of vasculature that were not previously addressed in the labeling.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for usestatement? No. This is not a change in the indications for use statement of the device.\n\nA4 - Could the change affect the directions for use of the device? Yes. Proceed to A1.1 -A1.5.\n\nA1.4 - Does the change describe a new disease, condition, or patient population that the device is intended for use in diagnosing, treating, preventing, curing or mitigating? No. The guidewire is intended for use in the treatment of similar patient populations with the same diseases, even if the access points differ.\n\nA1.5 - Does a risk-based assessment of the changed device identify any new risks or significantly modified existing risks? Yes. The revised instructions suggest that the device can be used in new vasculature, which would be considered an expansion of the device's indications for use. A risk-based assessment identifies that the new vasculature is more tortuous and significantly increases the risk of several device failure modes, which could significantly affect safety and effectiveness.\n\nDecision: New 510(k).\n\n8.\n\n8.\n\nChange: The original directions for use for a surgical laser intended to treat stones in the urinary tract only included instructions on lithotripsy modes. The instructions are modified to provide instructions on ablating soft tissue.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for use statement? No. This is not a change in the indications for use statement of the device.\n\nA4 - Could the change affect the directions for use of the device? Yes. Proceed to A1.1 - A1.5.\n\nA1.4 - Does the change describe a new disease, condition, or patient population that the device is intended for use in diagnosing, treating, preventing, curing or mitigating? Yes. The revised instructions would result in the device being intended for use for ablation of soft tissue, which is a new disease or condition that the device is intended for use in treating, preventing, curing or mitigating, as compared to the treatment of stones in the urinary tract.\n\nDecision: New 510(k).\n\n0. Change: The original directions for use for a surgical laser intended to treat stones in the urinary tract only included instructions on lithotripsy modes. The instructions are modified to provide additional instructions on the existing settings for lithotripsy on the cleared device, and does not modify instructions regarding compatible procedures or instruments.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for usestatement? No. This is not a change in the indications for use statement of the device.\n\nA4 - Could the change affect directions for use of the device? Yes. Proceed to A1.1 - A1.5.\n\nA1.4 - Does the change describe a new disease, condition, or patient population that the device is intended for use in diagnosing, treating, preventing, curing or mitigating? No. The condition that the device is intended to treat remains the same.\n\nA1.5 - Does a risk-based assessment of the changed device identify any new risks or significantly modified existing risks? No. The manufacturer's risk-based assessment concludes that the clarification of already existing settings does not introduce any new device risks, and the risk acceptability for the previously existing risks is not changed.\n\nDecision: Documentation.\n\n9. Change: A manufacturer changes the design of an IVD for diagnosing herpes simplex 1 and 2 to a less strict performance specification that decreases both the sensitivity and specificity of the device to increase production. The manufacturer updates the performance specifications found in the labeling of the device.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for usestatement? No. This is not a change in the indications for use statement of the device.\n\nA4 - Could the change affect the directions for use of the device? Yes. The change could affect the directions for use by adding new instructions on how to interpret diagnostic data from the device. Proceed to A1.1 -A1.5.\n\nA1.5- Does a risk-based assessment of the changed device identify any new risks or significantly modified existing risks? Yes. The changes to the device result in significantly increased existing risks. This is due to a mathematically expected increase in false positiveresults, which would, in turn, be expected to lead to an increase in harms such as mental anguish, delayed diagnosis for the true cause of any symptoms, and unnecessary treatment (e.g., pregnant women and newborns receiving unnecessary antiviral drugs or an unnecessary caesarean delivery of the fetus). Further, this would also significantly increase risks due to a mathematically expected increase in false negative results, which would, in turn, be expected to lead to an increase in harms such as delayed diagnosis that would in turn delay treatment of the underlying condition and could lead to unintended spread of the disease (e.g., through sexual partners, neonatal transmission during vaginal delivery, and transplanted organs).\n\nUsing only Flowchart A and the corresponding text, the decision based solely on the labeling change alone would be \"New 510(k).\" However, this type of change in labeling is in response to a design change. Accordingly, analyses under both Section A and Section D apply and the manufacturer is directed to D1.\n\nD1 - Does the change alter the operating principle of the IVD? No. The change in design is not one that alters the operating principle of the IVD.\n\nD3 - Does a risk-based assessment of the changed device identify any new risks or significantly modified existing risks? Yes. The manufacturer's risk-based assessment indicates that a change in the design of the IVD could significantly change the performance of the modified device compared to the previously cleared performance claims.\n\nDecision: New 510(k).\nChange: The manufacturer of an IVD indicated for use with patients who have symptoms and signs of a specified set of closely related diseases updates their labeling to indicate use for patients with signs and symptoms of another closely related disease not within the specified set cleared in its most recent 510(k).\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for usestatement? Yes. The labeling change is a change in the indications for use statement of the device. Proceed to A1.1 -A1.5.\n\nA1.4 - Does the change describe or suggest a new disease, condition, or patient population that the device will diagnose, treat, prevent, or mitigate? Yes. The labeling change describes a new disease that the device is intended for use in diagnosing that was not previously described by the original device.\n\nDecision: New 510(k).\n11. Change: The manufacturer changes the material of the immediate container for an IVD reagent such that the shelf-life of the reagent is extended 3 months. As a result of the change in materials to the immediate container for the IVD, the labeling is updated to reflect the extended shelf-life.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nA1- Is it a change in the indications for usestatement? No. This is not a change in the indications for use statement of the device.\n\nA3 - Is it a change in warnings or precautions? No. There is no precaution or warning pertaining to the shelf-life of the IVD.\n\nA4 - Could the change affect the directions for use? Yes. The labeling change to update the shelf-life could affect the instructions and directions for using the device. Proceed to A1.1 - A1.5.\n\n14.\n\n14.\n\nChange: A biliary stent manufacturer adds a new larger stent diameter to a family of biliary stents, 2 mm outside of the range of the manufacturer's previously cleared stents. The stent lengths are unchanged.\n\nRelevant questions:\n\nB5 - Is it any other change in design (e.g., dimensions, performance specifications, wireless communication, components or accessories, or the patient/user interface)? Yes.\n\nB5.1 - Does the change significantly affect the use of the device? The answer to this question depends on the original diameter of the stent and the extent of change in the diameter.\n--------------------\nContext title: Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.302309513092041"], "Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.082624912261963", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.7039291858673096", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information.

You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n\na) Single strength apple juice has a Brix value of 11.5 (21 CFR 101.30). You may use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice or other information such as data obtained through chemical analysis, information from databases, or reference documents (see response to Q&A 9). Therefore, the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice is 11.5% (based on weight).\n\nb) Determine the density of single strength apple juice with a Brix value of 11.5. You can either measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nc) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of single strength apple juice of the same type = 240 ml x density (g/ml) x 11.5 % (or.115).\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n\n11. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit juice blend containing the juices of multiple fruit types that is reconstituted above 100 percent where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)?\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is equal to or less than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice (e.g., less than 100% juice), the added sugar declaration would be zero.\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is greater than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final juice blend.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished juice blend product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the juice blend were reconstituted to single strength juice of the same type (i.e., the weight of sugars in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type). The single strength juice of the same type is a juice that contains the same ratios of the apple, mango, and pear juices in our hypothetical example.\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you can make a single strength juice blend with the same ratios of the three juices and measure the amount of total sugars per 240 ml serving size.\n\nYou can also calculate the sugar weight in the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type by the following method:\n\na) Calculate the ratios of the three juices in your formulation based on weight.\n\nTo obtain the weight-based ratios of the three juices in this hypothetical juice blend example, you need to first determine the weight-based concentration factors for the three types of juice. The weight-based concentration factor is the ratio of the Brix values between the concentrate and the single strength juice. For example, the weight-based concentration factor for the apple juice in the hypothetical example is 70 / 11.5 = 6.087. Using a similar calculation, the weight based concentration factor for the mango juice is 5.385 and the weight based concentration factor for the pear juice is 5.833.\n\nBecause the hypothetical juice blend formulation has 10% apple juice concentrate (70 Brix), 10% mango juice concentrate (70 Brix), and 20% pear juice concentrate (70 Brix), the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type would have the following ratios of single strength apple juice, single mango juice, and single pear juice:\n\nPercentage apple juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) apple juice concentration factor; percentage mango juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) mango juice concentration factor; percentage pear juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) pear juice concentration factor\n\nOr\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%. The sum of the ratios is 100% because all of the sugars in the juice blend are from the three types of juices.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSingle apple juice: single strength mango juice: single strength pear juice =\n\n({)[0.6087 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[0.5385 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[1.167 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (})\n\nOr\n\n26.30%: 23.27%: 50.42%\n\nb) Calculate the theoretical Brix value of the single strength juice blend of the same type juice with the same ratios of the three juices.\n\nThe theoretical Brix value of the juice blend is the sum of the multiplication products of the Brix value and the percentage contribution (the ratio percentage from step 2a) for each type of juice.\n\n(Single strength apple juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength apple juice) + (single strength mango juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength mango juice) + (single strength pear juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single pear juice) = theoretical Brix value of the hypothetical juice blend.\n\n11.5% (\\times) 26.31% + 13% (\\times) 23.27% + 12% (\\times) 50.42% = 12.10%.\n\nc) Determine the density of single strength juice blend with a Brix value of 12.10.

The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a \"statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content.\" What does FDA consider to be a \"sweetener?\" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term \"sweetener\" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.1318540573120117", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: Or\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%.

The amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition. Juice (fruit or vegetable) ingredients are unique in that the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient depends on whether the juice ingredient is concentrated, and thus, contains sugar in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. We realize that food formulation is complex and manufacturers can use different ingredients or alternative formulas to achieve the same finished product composition. For example, you may use 100% fruit juice and dry sugar in a baking application. You also may have an alternative formulation that uses concentrated fruit juice and liquid syrup to achieve the same product composition. When water or other wet ingredients containing water (e.g. milk, syrup, egg, diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, etc.) are added to a formulation containing concentrated juice and other ingredients during processing, the amount of moisture that goes towards reconstituting the juice or towards wetting or reconstituting other ingredients is not known. Furthermore, if the water added during formulation is divided among the ingredients when determining the amount of reconstitution or wetting that has occurred, different formulations of the same finished food could have different calculated added sugar amounts. Therefore, we considered an approach that we believe would provide a reasonable estimate of the added sugars content of a multi-ingredient product that includes concentrated fruit juice as an ingredient (e.g. a bakery product, marinade, or diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume). When concentrated juices are used in the formulation, we believe that it is practical to use all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of the concentrated juice when calculating the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product. It is also possible that the initial juice ingredient in the formulation (either diluted, 100%, or concentrated) is further concentrated during processing due to loss of water (e.g., during drying or baking). Because the amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition, you should account for the loss of water during processing to reflect the concentration of the juice ingredient after processing. Considering the complexity of food formulation and processing, we believe it is also appropriate to use the moisture content of the finished product towards reconstitution of the juice soluble solids when the product is subject to water loss during processing. This approach is consistent with our approach for the use of all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of concentrated juices when calculating the added sugars content of an ingredient. The following general approach can be used to calculate the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation. This general approach applies when there is either dilution or concentration during manufacturing.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of total sugars contributed by the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 2: Determine the water content (i.e., the moisture content) of the finished product.\n\nStep 3: Determine the sugar concentration of the juice ingredient with the assumption that all of the water in the finished product can be used to reconstitute the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 4: Compare this sugar concentration of juice ingredient with that of the theoretical single strength juice of the same type.\n\n(a) If the sugar concentration is less than, or the same as, the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient is zero.\n\n(b) If the sugar concentration is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, you may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 5: The amount of total added sugar per serving is the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient determined from step 4(b) plus added sugars from other ingredients (e.g., cane sugar), if any, in the formulation.\n\nIf you use multiple juice ingredients in your formulation, you may follow the same general steps above except that in step 4(b) you would need to use the method described in Q&A 12 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the multiple juice ingredients.\n\nTo demonstrate the general approach described above, we provide two hypothetical examples below. In these hypothetical examples, we use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration.\n\nHypothetical example 1:\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (5% apple juice at 70 Brix value). The finished product has a serving size of 250 gm and a moisture content of 50%.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars in the juice ingredient = weight per serving (\\times) percentage apple juice concentrate (\\times) % sugar in apple juice concentrate = 250 g (\\times) 5% (\\times) 70% = 8.75 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content or the moisture content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times) moisture content = 250 g (\\times) 50% = 125 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.974661111831665"]}
